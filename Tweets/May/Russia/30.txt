2) Oil embargo, even 90%, even if  up to the end of the year means a) #Russia failed to crack the #EU unity so far; b) RU has strategically lost EU market, bcs energy contracts are for 10-15 years. Once kicked off the market, RU won’t be able to return; c) “non-changable” changes
Tonight #EUCO agreed a sixth package of sanctions.  It will allow a ban on oil imports from #Russia.   The sanctions will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports. And by the end of the year, 90% of the Russian oil imported in Europe will be banned.

@SecBlinken Spread of US #inhumanity &amp; US $30 Trillion DEBT drives US to commit atrocities across globe.  #Russia #Ukraine is not enough.  #Taiwan Genocide next in quest to spread US inhumanity across the globe.  Spread of US inhumanity will not stop until mushroom clouds over US. 
#Canada asking #South_Korea to backfill artillery shells sent to #Ukraine. In effect, this would mean a non-NATO state contributing to the #NATO effort against #Russia in Ukraine.

#Britain's intel: #Russia has suffered "devastating losses" to its "mid and junior ranking officers", all the more impactful since the army "lacks the cadre of highly trained and empowered" NCOs, so the reconstituted BTGs are that much less effective.  
...“As for the reaction to such developments, in this particular case, according to claims made by the #UnitedStates, they have been trying to ‘catch up’ with #Russia for many years now, which has shown significant #progress in #developing #hypersonic systems. ..."  Cont'd...

Russia's Medvedev calls Biden announcement on Ukraine rocket systems 'rational' - Reuters UK   #Ukraine towns &amp; cities destroyed  thousands of Ukrainians killed, yet god forbid they dare to threaten #Russia the aggressor . #IstandwithUkraine    
Russians, Ukrainians fight block by block in eastern city (from @AP). #ukraine #russia #newsupdate #ukrainewar  
By attacking #Ukraine, breaking the promise not to attack neighbors &amp; cutting off the dialogue w #NATO #Russia violated NATO-Russia Act signed 25y ago. Thus, Russia itself removed restrictions for a robust NATO posture in the East: @Mircea_Geoana NATO DSG.

@Markh9191 @RettopNoj @vonderleyen #Ukraine️ is fighting with #russia for whole #Europe. So shut the fuck up and help #UA🇺🇦 fight for you!
The massive private jet flew from #Moscow to #Dubai to hide from western #sanctions and to avoid getting seized, since the #UAE refused to side with the US and its allies to sanction #Russia- but things didn't work out well for him.  #oligarchs   
The #Russia-#Ukraine conflict has reconfigured the global oil market, with African suppliers stepping in to meet European demand and Moscow, stung by Western sanctions, increasingly tapping risky ship-to-ship transfers to get its crude to Asia.

Our stories this week look at:  •China’s international relations with #Russia; •China’s neutrality on the war in #Ukraine;  •#China’s #political priorities; •What Biden’s big shift on Taiwan means; and •Making Russia pay to rebuild Ukraine won’t be easy 
Important to watch Izyum, given the knock-on effects it can have on #Russia's Donbas offensive if #Ukraine turns it around. The Russians are still making incremental gains in Donbas, but being contested in Kherson, Mykolaiv, and Zaporizhia.  
Beyond the brutality of the war in Ukraine, there is a story of heroic #Ukrainian resistance. That resistance has led to a see-saw conflict in which #Russia was pushed back after initial gains.
Why is this administration so slow in sending long range missiles. Are you afraid of that idiot Medvedev threatening us, because Russia f**ked up attacking Ukraine and can’t get out. Russia can not claim any victory when lose 30000 Russian soldiers, human beings. #Russia #CNN

I rarely disagree with @davidpgoldman.   On #Ukraine &amp; #Russia, he has been right for years.    In the present moment of war &amp; atrocity, it is hard for people to wrestle with the fact that had this been done years ago, tens of thousands of lives may have been saved. 
Biden rules out sending #Ukraine rockets that can strike into #Russia 
Speaking after agreement on a partial #Russia oil ban, E C President @vonderleyen says the Council should now be able to finalize a ban on almost 90 % of all Russian imports by the end of the year.  We will "soon return" to the issue of the remaining 10 percent, she adds

This is called sacrificing the poorest 75% on the alter of political idealism. At least it makes those politicians feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside, even as their people freeze and starve #Eurovision #ESG #FossilFuels #oil #Russia

@EmmanuelMacron #Russia does not consider #Europe as a formidable force to reacon with. The #Russia appeasement strategy from #France and #Germany  is directly responsible for #Europe's losing its negotiation edge. Meanwhile, #Russian NaZis continue with their crimes against humanity in #Ukraine
