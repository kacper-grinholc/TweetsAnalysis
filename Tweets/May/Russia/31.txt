@ThruthChecker Same source, may 30th (their archive is also very interesting, thanks): «The limited Ukrainian counterattack in northern Kherson Oblast did not take any further ground in the last 48 hours» #Ukraine #UkraineWar #Russia 
"We are already in WW3" Says several Ukrainian MP's. You also have citizens of Ukraine saying the same.  Russia invaded Ukraine before they joined NATO for a reason. To avoid confrontation with them.  Let's quit scaremongering now... :)   #UkraineRussiaWar #Ukraine #Russia

Last year #Nuclear fuel consultants TradeTech projected a circa 30 Million lbs net #Uranium supply deficit in 2027🔮🧙‍♀️ (before recent pivot from #Russia's enriched uranium &amp; new Nuclear Renaissance).↕️ Boss $BOE is hoping to make a 2.45M lb/yr dent in that gap post-2026.🏭⛏️🤠🐂  
Yo, the weapons we are sending #Ukraine are ending up in the black market... #ArmUkraineNow #Russia 
@confilmbuff I also just watched it. It is unbelievable how he found out with his team who actually poisoned him!  And it is only one of the serious lies of Putin that he has nothing to do with it... #Navalny #Russia #Documentary
..took the word of my #Russian Puppet Master over the facts presented 2 me by all 16 #US Intelligence agencies, facts that clearly showed our #Democracy, our Constitution &amp; every #American citizen came under attack by #Russia leading up 2 the 2016 election...

#US is expected to announce it will send #Ukraine a small number of high-tech, medium-range rocket systems, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been begging for as they struggle to stall #Russia's progress in the Donbas region, officials say.

Isn't invading a #sovereign country #Illegal? #Russia should pay to rebuild everything in #Ukraine.  Think about how many Ukrainians they have tortured, raped, murdered.  #RussiaIsATerroristState.

Well, this establishes #LSD use in #Russia to me... 
#Ukraine #Russia   To you Russians worrying about your kids in Ukraine &amp; using the Minsk agreement as a premise of justifying your evil invasion, it was forced on UKR by France &amp; Germany who were &amp; have always been on the side of Putin.  PROUD TO HELP UKR 🇺🇸
#UkraineRussiaWar  2. any observer knows that if the West tries to defeat Russia in this war, #Russia will have no option but escalate it using nuclear weapons to end WWIII. NO WINNERS.
The #US-led Western countries delivered batches of lethal weapons to #Ukraine and imposed bunches of sanctions on #Russia #俄乌局势 #US 
US foreign policy was driven by fear of #SovietUnion/#Communism during #ColdWar. US got in bed with very bad despots/militants in the false belief in the inevitable spread of communism. But the Soviet economy was unsustainable; doomed to fail. #Russia is weak; #Putin will fall.
I have lucid dreams about majestic LNG terminals and beautiful nuclear plants. Dreams of amazing energetic independence from the Russian regime of state terrorism. Then I wake up all sweaty, still dependent on Russian blood and rape gas. #Ukraine #Russia #PutinWarCriminal 
Thank you to the @NCDCgov for its response and frank statement denying #Russia's federal allegations
32 media workers have been killed covering #Russia's war on #Ukraine, Zelensky said in nightly address. French journalist Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff became the latest victim Monday, when an armored evacuation vehicle came under Russian fire in Luhansk region

@EmperorScott54 @nexta_tv I mean, people in #Russia say these pictures have been staged, are #fake news. No, they #loot, they steal everything they can. Because in Russia, 30 million people do not have a Western flush indoor #toilet but shit in the fields: facts! No electricity, no internet.
Pro-Russian fighters of the Luhansk People's Republic fire artillery shells with leaflets into Ukrainian positions near Sievierodonetsk.  These leaflets give instructions on how to surrender to Russian forces, proper procedures, and what to expect. #Ukraine #Russia 
@MsElephantGun @myroslavapetsa Evil #Russia is like barbaric jihad, stained forever! #StopNonsenseWars
The only pol solution 2 put an end to this war would be a bilateral agreement btw #Russia &amp; #Ukraine where the latter agrees not 2 become a member of the #NATO &amp; refrains from defence agreements with Russia's rivals. And,Russia reciprocate it with no war ever. Would others agree? 
solve the problem," Turkish Foreign Minister #Cavusoglu said.   Previously, Kiev has repeatedly falsely accused #Russia of mining.  #RussianUkrainianWar #UkraineWar

The #WagnerMercenaries sanctioned by #Russia, lost as of six-weeks ago, lost over 5,000 out of 8,000-troops in #Ukraine. Now these mercenaries are fighting in #Mali with their military killing and murdering civilians. Hundreds were executed in many cities. Russia is proud of them

If the current TIV patterns persist over the next decade—2021–2031, and if India’s current #defence industrialisation drive remains on track, the margin between #Russia’s share and the other suppliers will shrink further: @KartikBommakan1 &amp; @SameerP_IND.
