.@SecDef Certainly you are aware that according to international law, any State providing “military assistance” to one side in a military conflict, being a @NATO member notwithstanding, removes neutrality and makes that State an ally! @NATO has already attacked #Russia🇷🇺!
@stzeer6 @InfinateRealms @slowissmoothsm1 @KyivIndependent Yeah they want to be "independent", just like all those other regions of countries that Russia invaded. Just like now that Russia has put a pro Russian government in place of #Kherson, they suddenly want to be annexed by Russia.  #Russia started this war in 2014, not #Ukraine
In Solokhi, #Belgorod region, south #Russia, unidentified individuals reportedly opened fire on the village killing 1 person and injuring 3. Solokhi is located 40 km west of Belgorod and near the border with Ukraine.

There will be countless stories of heroism &amp; tactics that turned the tide in critical battles to come out of this war.  This one will be a movie. The screenplay writes itself. @kms_d4k probably already has offers to secure movie rights in his DM. #Ukraine #Russia #SiverskyiDonets 
@vtchakarova When the real original inhabitants of @Palestine can’t get their an ancestral land back from @ZelenskyyUa’s cousins in #ApartheidIsrael, #Ukraine will have less chance of kicking our the #Russia-supported; righteous owners of Novorossiya from their lands

The U.S has sent so many Javelin missiles to Ukraine, they'll need a year to replace them 😂. In the end, most have been destroyed by #Russia, the rest are in the vast stockpiles held by the DPR and LPR. Thank you Uncle Sam for your generosity!
"In a few months #Russia will have:  A far stronger economy.  A battle hardened military.  A victory in #Ukraine.  A NATO missing half its gear, if not most of it.  Europe's NATO nations almost completely fuel starved, w/collapsed economies, &amp; brewing civil wars." 3
#Ukraine has offered #Russia to exchange wounded Ukrainian soldiers who are on the territory of the #Azovstal plant in Mariupol for captured Russian soldiers "according to the standard rules for exchange of prisoners of war",said Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Irina Vereshchuk. 
#Russia encourage this action. Live next to a bully and one has to take care of their own country.

Heard (D) senator @MarkWarner @BBCHARDtalk with Stephen Sackur. Warner is a dangerous deep state operative, IMO, driving multiple hyperbolic #Russia narratives simultaneously; including the patent nonsense "we all know Putin wasn't going to stop at #Ukraine." The big ticket lie. 
How likely is it that we can see #Russia withdrawing from #Syria?
