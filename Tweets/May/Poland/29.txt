an expulsion of 45 RUS diplomats in #Poland , to be sure, Z and Duda acted with US approval.  Ukraine's sovereignty over its western regions bordering Poland is eroded. Kiev has also announced plans to grant special legal status to Polish citizens. de facto “merger” is under way.
The Ukraine SVR said the US was discussing with #Poland a plan under which Polish “peacekeeping” forces without a NATO mandate would enter parts of western Ukraine where the chance of a confrontation with Russian forces was low.  The SVR's intelligence scoop presumably triggered

Desperation of RUS propaganda. Now claiming that Poland is going to invade UA, to justify their preparation of invading Poland. Poland just provided its stockpile on military equip to UA just to invade UA. Smart #ZelenskyyUA #UkraineRussianWar #Poland
