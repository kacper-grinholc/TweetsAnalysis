Soaring cost of living forces Poles to change lifestyles, almost 3.4 million Ukranians have crossed into #Poland since the start of the conflict. With #inflation surging beyond 12%, many Poles are keeping expenses to a minimum to get through each month, a survey shows

#Russia severs ties with other nations over its belligerence  (1)  Russia withdraws from the Council of the Baltic Sea States  (2) The Nordic Council of Ministers decided to suspend cooperation with Russia and Belarus  #StandWithUkraine #Sweden #Finnland #Germany #Poland #Denmark
