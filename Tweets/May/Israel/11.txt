@Timesofgaza @MsParaDoxy #Israel can now consider itself no better than #russia
#Israel has a short, but rich #History of EXECUTING civilians. 
Make no mistake: Israeli soldiers have purposefully murdered both peace activists and journalists before. They've done it multiple times--and then try to cover it up. And seldom is anyone held to account. #Israel #IsraeliCrimes #Palestine 
@SnookMalcolm @sanyaburgess @Mellowtopia They can admit it as the West support Apartheid Israel. Lies anti-Semitic to criticise or investigate #Israel's atrocities, let alone hold them to account.  BDS to Israel criminalised in UK.  BJ/Patel secret dealings with them. KS purging labour of non-Zionist/pro-Palestine Jews. 
#Israel will not investigate itself. The #West will not investigate it and if they do, there will never be meaningful consequences.

@OrganJM @RepAndreCarson @AlJazeera “Both-siding” gaslighting narrative to neutralise events of what’s purely illegal occupying military power #Israel’s agression versus the oppressed native #Palestinians living under illegal military occupation. White fragility spinning into overdrive. Read below #ShireenAbuAkleh 
#Israel This will not be the last crime committed by the Israeli army. They killed children, adults and women, and soon they will drink from the same cup and the whole world will not sympathize with you because you deserve death.
What would Europe say if the Palestinian journalist Shereen Abu Aqleh (51 years old) instead of having been shot in the head by the Israeli occupying forces was Ukrainian and the bullets came from Russia? #Israel remains untouchable. Intolerable. 
Dies at 51 ?  @nytimes you shameless freaks. Is that a bloody justification ? Like it was supposed to happen this way? some natural process ? She was murdered in broad day light in front of not just any witnesses but journalist by #Israel. #IsraeliCrimes #IsraeliApartheid

Initial probe shows that Israeli forces shot rounds towards Shireen Abu Akleh: HAARETZ  #Palestine #Israel #AbuAkleh #Jenin 
#Israel has been killing #Palestinian Journalists for decades with impunity. This time they murdered #ShireenAbuAkleh in cold blood. Like before Israel will not be held accountable. This cannot continue! #Israelis are INHUMANE, do not belong in #OccupiedPalestine and MUST GO!
Ha'aretz, according to an "Israeli" Criminal Forces investigation: Some of the bullets fired by soldiers from the "Israeli" Duvdevan unit (zionist operators who carry undercover operations) were fired towards the north, where #ShireenAbuAkleh was. #IsraeliCrimes "#Israel"

#AlJazeera journalist #ShireenAbuAkleh was shot and killed by #Israeli forces in the occupied #WestBank while covering an Israeli raid in #Jenin. She was shot in the face, despite wearing a press vest. Her body has arrived in #Ramallah. #Palestine #Israel #ShireenAbuAqla 
Still on the murder of Al Jazeera Palestinian journalist, Shireen Abu Akleh by Israelis  #NaijaloveinfoForeign #Terrorism #Israel #IsraeliCrimes #WarCrimes #Warzone #Naijaloveinfo 
Never accept less than delivering the killer to The International Criminal Court. #ShireenAbuAqla was an iconic frontline journalist fighting for truth. Our condolence to her family, followers and every free journalist. #Palestine #Jenin #AlJazeera #Israel #WarCrimes

Color me shocked...not🙄 #Palestinians blame #Israel for all their savage heathen deeds 💙🕎💙 #Zionist #Zionism 
Don't you dare be angry at #Israel for murdering yet ANOTHER reporter cause that will make you anti-Semitic! Also Don't any Western news media call this for what it was, a deliberate execution of a reporter wearing a press vest and helmet.  #ShireenAbuAkleh #IsraeliCrimes 
Shame on you Israel! Yoh cowards will never be able to rule the world! All the prophecies are against you! Try your bestest and later prepare to be wiped off from this Earth!  #Israel #IsraeliCrimes #IsraeliWarCrimes #IsraelMustBeDestroyed 
#Opinion: The Jewish state, where more Jews live than in any other country, is perceived as the world’s worst place. The @UN, much more influential than @amnesty, treats Israel this way. Every year the UN censures #Israel far more than any other country.
Because the soldiers are not Russians and the girl is not Ukrainian!! Shame on you #Israel shame on you and your twisted lying coverage @AvichayAdraee

@hyprfoci @brianstelter Waaiiitttt..  Wut???  This ain't #i24News, or even #CNN, so why on Earth are you fanning fundie #SPAM? #Isrāel
1929-1939 #Ukraine infested by Fascists terrorising killing people. 1945 #Russia stopped them. #Nazism re-emerges #Maidan 2014. 2019-2022: Journalists 'disappeared' by #US puppet #Zelensky #Fascistregime. #UkraineOnFire:  See Also: #ShireenAbuAkleh #Israel
Unbelievable that clearly marked journalists are shot in the occupied West Bank.  An independent (non-Israeli) criminal investigation is needed to answer why and bring the murder to justice.   #ShireenAbuAkleh #justice #journalist #Israel #Palestine  
A mural in Idlib, Syria, for the late #ShireenAbuAkleh who was executed with cold blood by "Israeli" criminal forces today morning. Farewell, Shireen. #IsraeliCrimes "#Israel" 
I was on a flight when I heard the news and what’s the most shocking is that the media’s open repulsion for journalist Khashoggi’s murder isn’t being fairly repeated for the Israeli blatant disregard for human life. #israel #Palestine #Criminal #murderer #justiceforpalestine 
“We learn that if we honor the first commandment of loving GOD Almighty with all our heart, mind, soul, being, strength, might, wisdom, understanding, and everything that we are, then we know that we are going to obey all the commandments.” #KingJesusChrist #JesusChrist #Israel

“We learn from Moses how Moses speaks about the need to preach the commandments and teach the commandments whenever we are not busy in order to have them as a reminder in our minds and hearts.” #KingJesusChrist #JesusChrist #GenesistoRevelation #Israel
@Amjad_Alkadri @brianstelter @CNN Premature overstatement!  Also..  Quite a lot of #proPalestinian would confidently challenge your own phraseology. #Isrāel "#JournalismIsNotACrime"
"How many more need to be killed before the international community acts to hold #Israel accountable for the continuing crimes against humanity?” #EndIsraeliApartheid 
@barnettm7 @brianstelter Bwahahahahah!  That story applies more to the zombie-cognition of your ilk, than anything.  At least have some shame to make an addendum after your favoured TP gets debunked, but then: You live-&amp;-die for [K]#Hasbara, so.. #Isrāel #pressfreedom
If I voice an opinion that criticises the #Russia govt and military for breaking international law and murdering journalists. I’m not anti Russian Orthodox Church   If I criticise #Israel for murdering journalists and breaking international law I am not Anti Semitic   #Palestine
@naftalibennett you made a mistake. This isnt going away. Truth of more videos will show your lies. #ShireenAbuAkleh death will not be in vain. Shame on @cnn &amp; any #media that #Hypocrisy is obvious. #Ukraine Is #Palestine, #Russia is #israel. All in due  time. History showed us. 
However, some activists have dismissed #Manama’s condemnation as insincere amid intensifying criticism of the regime’s normalization deal with #Israel.
“We know that the specific understanding of that is that there are philosophies that want to lead people to hate.” #KingJesusChrist #JesusChrist #GenesistoRevelation #ChristianityFulfillsJewishHistory #Israel #Scripture #Belief
#Israel killed 55 journalists since 2000. It's a #PressFreedom #Genocide.  Hey, #EuropeanUnion, where are your sanctions now?  #EUROVISION #Eurovision2022
“We learn that there were other philosophies that were trying to lead far from the word of GOD Almighty.” #KingJesusChrist #JesusChrist #GenesistoRevelation #ChristianityFulfillsJewishHistory #Israel #Scripture #Belief

“This is speaking about not being a part of sin and idolatry because sin wants to lead farther to sin. Sin wants to lead farther and farther from GOD Almighty.” #KingJesusChrist #JesusChrist #GenesistoRevelation #ChristianityFulfillsJewishHistory #Israel #Scripture #Belief
Who’s surprised? Of course they’ll blame the victims, disgusting is an understatement! #Israel has fooled the world for so long it’s time to call them out every single day! Justice for #ShireenAbuAkleh and the millions they’ve murdered! #FreePalestine from #ApartheidIsrael
