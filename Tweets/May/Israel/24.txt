Sickening. #Israel. New evidence suggests Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in targeted attack by Israeli forces
In New York City tens of thousands gather to celebrate #Israel 🇮🇱
#ShireenAbuAkleh  was assassinated. The #BidenAdministration wants  to ignore the fact in order to  (as with the assassination of #JamalKhashoggi where they chose to continue condoning the autocratic #Saudi regime) continue to support the #Apartheid regime in #Israel. 
OH BOY!!! #ShireenAbuAqla #Shireen_Abu_Akleh #shireen #Israel  #Palestine #MiddleEast
@MazMHussain At some point, and soon, #Israel must be how to count for their years of  #HumanRights abuses against the #Palestinians and their illegal occupation of their territory—and US must stand back and allow it to happen.

Dear @amnesty @AmnestyUK @amnestyusa, please explain why #Israel is deemed #apartheid, where its Muslim/Arab pop flourish &amp; are in government/supreme court etc, but #China isn’t? Just double-standard &amp; Jew-hate.  Faces from China’s #Uyghur detention camps  
High-profile assassinations of Iranian figures blamed on #Israel!  #Iran blames Israel for assassinating high-profile military, nuclear figures.  #geopolitics

Settlers pepper-spraying a family, including a baby, for no apparent reason. No one will be caught. No one will be punished. It could happen on camera in front of soldiers and there will be no justice. There is impunity for violence against Palestinians in #Israel. 
@tedcruz   is not happy to fund NGO's that document war crimes and human rights violations committed by #Israel. Of course he has no problem funding war crimes, just doesn't want it to be documented. #Tedcruz #idiotseverywhere #democrats #Republicans
