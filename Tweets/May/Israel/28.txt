It seems Tehran wants to send a message to #Israel that “nothing can harm #Iran’s power even if they destroy #IRGC drone base.” The Army’s deputy chief for military operations says the UAVs at the top secret drone base 313 “fly at very special &amp; usually overseas operations.” 
The visit comes just 2 days after #Israel’s alleged attack on the Defense Ministry’s Parchin technology complex with suicide drones/quadrocopters killing and injuring 2 engineers. Months ago  a similar attack damaged an #IRGC’s drone base in same province.
Tomorrow is celebrated as #Jerusalem_Day_Flag_March by #Israeli far-right forces in #Israel. As in the past, their mobs will March through the Old City of #Jerusalem shouting death to Arabs, Islam &amp; Palestine. Let’s all please use the flag of Palestine as our new profile picture.
