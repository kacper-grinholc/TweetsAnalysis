Look at this blasphemous headline from the magazine that just interviewed the beast MBS in April. All things consist by the #Lord #Jesus Christ &amp; NOT the bottomless pit where the beast JUDAS ISCARIOT will ascend from 42 months after MBS confirms the covenant with #Israel. #TRUTH! 
@NYDailyNews #Jews r not semites attacker looks more of a semite! #Ashkenazi = German &amp; French #Sephardic = Spainards both = came from hapsburgs! Jews are loyal to #Israel &amp; in #USA they are taking all the benefits intended for struggling #Americans loyal to USA! Facts not condoning attacks!

#Hitler #Nations Knowledge is power site airs: Professor #Huntington of #Harvard says #AmericanEthos is #Anglo-Protestant, what is that of #India? Why have the #Jews of #Israel thanked India in the first session of its #Knesset?  
Wow this is huge news for a #Tottenham and #Israel fan like myself 
Must read  horrifying article. The worst part of it is the US administration is not only undermining #AbrahamAccords, but preventing #Sudan's population from benefiting as a result of a more direct involvement by #Israel, despite all the hardships.
If "#Israel" is serious about holding the #FlagMarch" tomorrow, it should know that it's going to trigger an explosion that we Arabs &amp; Muslims will not tolerate. #Zionism #Jerusalem #Yerushalayim  #JerusalemDay #YomYerushalayim #FreePalestine #Palestine
World-renowned Israeli immunology expert Michael Sela, who co-invented the multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone,  died on Friday at the age of 98.  #Israel | #Obituary | #Science  
These people have the spine that many nations lack to call  spade a spade. And does US really think Iraqi people really give a hoot what it thinks or say!? Most of the world doesn't care even!  #Israel  #IsraeliApartheid  #IsraeliTerrorists  #Palestine
