@Majdakle06 @mancbluejoo @UKParliament @btselem Seriously? Your plan is: 1. #Israel agree to an investigation they've already agreed to.  2. The #Palestinians agree to an investigation they don't want. 3. But ... wait for it ... #Israel  must agree to your rap sheet first. One question, what planet🪐are you on?
Some groups experience extreme hate, &amp; survive the impossible only to become worse than their oppressor, a #colonizer, a proud #apartheid state like #Israel. Some turn out to be a bastion of democracy, a voice for the oppressed...like #Ireland. 
Russian anti-air system openet fire at Israeli warplanes in #Syria last night. Russian S-300 have been in Syria for quite some time, but #Russia has blocked its use to allow #Israel to target #Iranian proxies.

Here's one of my favourite bands, #OrphanedLand from #Israel. I missed lunchtime, but it's my birthday so you'll forgive me. :-)      #LunchtimeListens #WorldMusic
"I remember 17% #inflation and long [gas] lines and #Israel being in trouble in the #Carter years, and we don't want to go back to the Carter years. We want to go forward." —Senator #CharlesGrassley on #Stagflation &amp; #JimmyCarter {#Bidenflation}
@TTibuhaburwa @wickedscholar @lapatina_ The only thing that  #Israel has learned from ww2 seems to be from the Nazis not to build concentration camps just kill them where they live then push the survivors off their land and resettle it they have taken their worst memories of ww2 &amp; are now being used on #Palestine'ians
#Russia|n forces opened fire on #Israel|i jets with advanced S-300 anti-aircraft missiles at the end of an alleged IAF attack on targets in northwestern #Syria last week, Channel 13 news reported Monday 
The IDF confirmed it had identified suspicious activity near Shavei Shomron and its troops are currently searching the area, following reports of a Palestinian terrorist infiltrating the settlement.  #Israel | #WestBank  
We might take notes from Israelis and release our next collection as a nasal spray instead of common packages. 🤪🍄 Jokes aside this is a great idea, full article here 👇🏽 #xTRIP #NFT #XRPL #Israel #Psilocybin 
Oh give me a break! They're not 'Philistines'. 'Palestinians' have ARABIAN names, denoting where they are FROM &amp; they speak ARABIC. Philistines were GREEK. But I see you hate them from your description of them even though they fight neighboring regimes' proxy war against #Israel 
On my #bucketlist Unfortunately I can only dream of it. My mind wants to go, but my body refuses. Inner travel with books is a nice alternative 😊  #Israel 💕 
Idk who needs to hear this tonight but, We Palestinians don’t need sympathy, we don’t need food packages. We just want our rights. So much to ask?   #Israel
Immensely proud to have worked with my amazing team at @The_ILF and our global partners, to produce this important report on the @UN_HRC #FixedInquiry against #Israel and how the COI Chair #PillayIsBiased.  Full report here:  
#Israel🇮🇱 interferes in #US🇺🇸 elections.  #AIPAC launched the #UDP in December as a super political action committee, or Super Pac, which is permitted to spend without restriction in support of candidates.  
Shame #USA # SHAME AMERICA #SHAME #UNO @UNOCHA #Shame #Israel  Israel is a terrorist state. #FreePalestine  #ahmadmanasra #FreeAhmadManasra. 
Just as the #UK government Boycotts, Divests from &amp; Sanctions the shit out of #Russia the same government wants to ban anyone from exercising their own moral judgement &amp; boycotting, divesting from &amp; sanctioning apartheid #Israel. #BDS  #ShamefulHypocrisy
Azerbaijan do you know your leader is kissing  up to a man who said this about Palestinian? Stop selling oil to #israel. #Azerbaijan #IsraeliCrimes #Palestine 
If true, as it appears to be, it has to be huge:  #Russian forces have opened fire on #Israeli jets in northwestern Syria last week, with advanced S-300 anti-aircraft missiles for the first time.   The move could signal a significant shift in #Moscow's ties with #Israel. 
Outsource the border and tunnel detection to #Israel  They aren't incompetent like  @JoeBiden   #ImpeachBiden  #MAGA

#Israel that’s what you get when you bed down with the #devil. Lesson learned, perhaps. Trusting #Russians is a bit naive for a government as seasoned as yours. I’m disappointed. 
they don't release ballistic report, yet ready to accuse and protest? why?   #KnowTheFacts #StandWithAllies #Israel #EqualRightsForRefugees 
The report claimed that the S-300 battery is “operated by the Russians,” and that it constituted the first time that Russian forces fired on the Israeli Air Force.  #russia #syria #israel
#Nakba74: In 1948, #KhazarianMafia #Zionists told #Russia NO on their free land offer, and instead demolished 500 towns in #Palestine, and drove out between 750,000 to 900,000 #Palestinian #men, #women and #children from their homeland to create their #Zionist project "#Israel". 
#israel #israeli Was it worth it? You’ve been tricked into killing your people. 
"Residents of Shavei Shomron were instructed to lock themselves in houses following an unusual identification in the area: #Israel 
.@AnnelleSheline: "As the talks to restore the Iran nuclear deal remain stalled, it seems the #Biden administration has fallen back on old habits: prioritize relations with the #UAE and #SaudiArabia, as well as with #Israel."  #UnitedStates
Remaining outside the Visa Waiver Program means that #Israel has failed to meet its requirements. 
@SamRyderMusic You are the best.I love your song Spaceman so so much.Amazing artist.From #Israel.Me.

@RashidaTlaib What was wrong with creation of #Israel, they want to live in peace. #PALESTINE isn't peaceful. Love how you are less worried about your own homeland, than everyone else's land.
#Spaceman #SamRyder #UK #Israel I love this song so much.Sam you are an amazing artist.

My identity shouldn’t come with a F* warning message ffs.  we are being erased everywhere. What have we done to deserve this.   #FreeSpeech #Israel 
Until it reaches closer &amp; blows violently in your face inside #Israel ‘proper’ you drink your coffee peacefully &amp; treat what’s happening in the occupied territories as “noise from distant galaxies.” #PALESTINE #Jerusalem #Gaza #America #democracy #Politics 
@MinnesotaDFL @mngop @KimCrockettSOS You mad about this? Wait until you see the bill #TheSquad2022 just introduced against  #Israel @IlhanMN @AOC @RashidaTlaib
@antihobbes #ShireenAbuAkleh was press. It was her job to cover atrocities, just like in #Ukraine. What we have here is #Israel, a brutal occupying force which unlike #Russia is able to kill, maim &amp; imprison #Palestinians with total impunity. #ApartheidIsrael no longer has anywhere to hide.
