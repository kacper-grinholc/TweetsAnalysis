Add a suspected case of #monkeypox in #Israel 🇮🇱  Initial testing of some European cases indicate that it’s the West African Clade of Monkeypox. So if this virus hasn’t changed then there is an alternate explanation. Waning protection from smallpox vaccine? Immunosuppression?  
#Israel has entered the #MonkeyPox chat. How many countries does this make now?

On IG live, @AOC again hurls unfounded accusations against Israel, and also claims that U.S. aid to #Israel undermines America's ability to provide quality healthcare.  Then seconds later she says we need to fight #antisemitism...?  Here's a thought, AOC: follow your own advice.
