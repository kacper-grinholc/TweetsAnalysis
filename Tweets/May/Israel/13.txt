In other words - they tried to lie because they assumed #Palestine had no receipts …  But but there were receipts  What’s been confirmed is that #Israel , its PM, it’s military, it’s lobby etc are NOT to be believed when it comes to issue of Palestine and their #ApartheidIsrael 
#IsraeliCrimes  #Israel  Just leave them alone sons of a b***** 
@allforthanookie Perpetual victims even when shooting journalists in the face, bombing children, bombing neighbouring countries, ethnically cleansing the indigenous population, stealing people’s homes and destroying their livelihoods, witholding dead bodies, storming holy sites… 🥱🥱🥱 #Israel

@Marwa__Osman Included your tweet in report on #Israel's new round of #WarCrimes against #Syria. 
@MallardDuck13 @SocialistDarwi1 @nicks_leon @VaushV How political was the murder of #ShireenAbuAkleh?  You beclown yourself.  There is no way to spin these #IsraeliCrimes which can absolve #Israel of blame.  Frankly, it's just more of the same and I couldn't care less what lies #Israelis tell themselves so they can sleep at night.
Every nation, including #Israel, precisely needs friends like this -- those, as we've seen recently, who encourage brutality, cover-over crimes and prolong the myth of a cost-free occupation of Palestinian lands are no true friends of Israel and its long-term national security 
Vile and disgusting behaviour from a vile and disgusting regime.  #ısrael #IsraeliCrimes #IsraeliPolice 
Israel Police clashed with Palestinian mourners packed around the coffin of killed Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Akleh at the start of her funeral procession in Jerusalem on Friday.  #Israel | #ShireenAbuAqla
Journalists used to care when a fellow journalist was killed doing his or her job. There was unity among all journalists.  Now they write $h1t like this 👇about each other's deaths. They've killed their own respect. #palestine #journalism #Press #bbc #Shireen #israel

@meghamohan #Israel will likely find some excuse to arrest AbuAkleh's brother and hold him in "administrative detention" for this. International attention will delay such an action perhaps but this is how the Israelis treat Arabs.

When #Israel attacks Palestine, no human right organizations or countries say anything, when Palestines retaliate is called terrorism. Jews and israelíes in USA always use the #Holocaust as an excuse for their attacks. #IsraeliCrimes cannot go unseen anymore!!

@RashidaTlaib The only problem with #ShireenAbuAkleh was that she was not #Ukrainian and #Israel is not #Russia or any muslim country. Otherwise, we would have witnessed historical uproar form west to east and most probably another war.
Israel gave Palestine a huge chunk of land, The West Bank. So to end all the fighting #Israel could take it's very capable military into Gaza &amp; transport Palestinians to the west bank. And Gaza will revert back to Israel. It makes no sense for Palestinians to occupy Gaza.

@JustinTrudeau and the @liberal_party are supporters of Isreal and their terrorist regime. Canada is complicit to these grotesque attack of a funeral procession #IsraeliCrimes #IsraeliApartheid #Israel #ShireenAbuAkleh #Canada #CrimesAgainstHumanity 
I am so done keeping quiet. It’s time to call out this Israeli regime as a despotic apartheid driven state for what it is - brutal and intolerant on every level. There is nothing to excuse the ‘murder’ and certainly the brutal response to a religious burial. Shame on you #Israel 
Let JESUS CHRIST be your example of all things !!! #RoadToAngola #WednesdayEternalWord  #MondayEveningWord #TejRan  #UST  #Israel  #pfizerdocuments  #Heartstopper 
#Israel is a a war criminal … the countires’ support of billions of dollars is got to stop!! #IsraeliCrimes #FreePalestine 
What is happening with #Israel and  #Ukraine are a statement to the world that our corrupted leaders do not care about #Humanity, they care about taking our #money to finance #Terrorism, the #nazi one and the #zionist one. While slowly killing us with #famine and #vaccine...
#God of the #Bible-A National God. The Bible talks not of God, but of the God of #Israel. We read in it again and again: And also thus said the king, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it. [I Kings 1:48]
This footage is so damn disturbing!   Get it together #Israel 
Knowing how critical this situation is, security forces should have secured the way from the hospital to the church, not preventing it in a barbaric way. Shame!  R.I.P colleague #ShireenAbuAqla   #Palestine #Israel #فلسطين #اسرائيل #إسرائيل #القدس #Jerusalem

#God of the #Bible - A National God. The Bible talks not of God, but of the God of #Israel. We read in it again and again: And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me. [I Samuel 25:32]
