It is valid criticism if current #Israel depends upon annihilation of #Palestine and its native Palestinian people. Existence of Palestine doesn’t depend upon annihilation of Jews or any other faith communities whose origins have been in Palestine pre settler colonial Israel.

After stating that she was leaving the coalition, Meretz MK to stay in coalition, May 22. It removed the threat of #Knesset disbanding and causing early elections in #Israel. The announcement was made after she met with @yairlapid &amp;  mayors &amp; stated that the  other govt. is worse 
@jeremyslevin I don’t think you appreciate that ten population of #Israel is similar to that of Hungary. I don’t think that you realize that at the time that @BernieSanders volunteered on a kibbutz back in the 60s , Israel’s population was about 3m.

#Iranian KAYHAN affiliated to #Khamenei editorial "General Sayyad had a lot of progress" promisses "a painful revange inside &amp; outside #Israel, not only to kill a few #Zionists, but to bring the destruction of Israel closer". 
Did you know that Magen David collects, tests, processes, and distributes 100% of the blood needed for wounded IDF soldiers? #Israel #IDF 
@saritm0 @basel_adra IDF soldiers are there for a reason. But of course you won’t mention that. You full of hate for #Jews ✡️ in #Israel 🇮🇱. 
This is the spot-on reality of tiny #Israel &amp; approx 15 million #Jews WORLDWIDE. It’s surrounded by enemies &amp; we live among those who want us dead or otherwise gone - whether it’s the @CUNYLaw valedictorian wanting to light a Jew on fire in NYC or this motley mob in London. 
Come and join the 1st #padthai Competition in #Israel.  #Muaythai will be  demonstrated as well as other activities for the whole family in #Thai atmosphere. 
It’s become a habit for #Iran that every #Israel targets Iranian assets inside the country or outside, Iranian regime and its proxy Iraqi groups somehow put the blame on the #Kurdistan Region and respond with threats/attacks on the Region. 
The UK and US governments, The Fed, The BoE, and all MSM are all controlled by Jewish and Christian #Zionist warmongers. Rid the West of this cancer and you will have world peace.   Stop #Israel now.
