The woman clearly stated that it has no link with @GovPakistan. They are a bunch of interfaith Pakistani Americans visiting #Israel on their own but @ImranKhanPTI and his goons are exploiting every thing for their cheap point scoring.

So....The only HURDLE in recognising the #terrorist state of #Israel by #Pakistan is @ImranKhanPTI...  Hmmm! @OfficialDGISPR  #حقیقی_آزادی_مارچ #امپورٹڈ_حکومت_نامنظور 
The Conclusion is:  The #Israel Visit of #AhmedQureshi has been Justified by Our "Senior Journalists" in a Space Session..  End of Discussion..👏👏
Researchers from #Israel's Tel Aviv University have detected a mechanism shared by genetic mutations associated with a handful of brain disorders. This discovery could lead to improved treatment for various brain ailments. Incredible! 🧠🇮🇱  For more: …

As #apartheid #Israel’s siege of #Gaza enters its 15th year, food sovereignty, climate justice and self-sufficiency have become central issues in the greater fight for justice and Palestinian liberation.  #Palestine #BDS #ICC #Occupation #SettlerColonialism
@JerryDunleavy @elonmusk @stats_feed @engineers_feed Why spread hate. The #US is the greatest violator of #HumanRights globally &amp; supports the oppressor #Israel against the #Palestinians &amp; the #Indians against #Kashmiris.  #FreeKashmir #FreePalestion #ThanksElon
May Allah liberate our lands and humiliate those who have normalised relations with Israel, Ameen...#Palestine #Israel #Islamophobia #AlAqsa #AlAqsaUnderAttacak 
So who is this delegation? To whom do they belong? Is #Pakistan really going to accept #Israel (God Forbid)? It's not type of decision that any government or political party can make. It must be decision of public who feels, understands and remembers the pain of #Palestinians.

Big shout out to @israelpolice and all of #Israel’s security services, for successful management and coordination of today’s #Jerusalem Day Parade, which was overwhelmingly peaceful and without major problem.

#Israel sees relatively peaceful #Jerusalem day despite some clashes.  'Israel's status quo - that was declared, that has not been changed in the Temple Mount - showed today... that it stayed the same,' says @eitan_dangot.

@MohmedR79181345 For Palestinians to raise a flag in Jerusalem, despite this brutal violence, is to remind them of what they dread the most: We are still here. #FreePalestine #EndIsraeliApartheid #EthnicCleansing #Israel #Huwara
Ahmed Qureshi's visit to #Israel has not come a suprise to me. He has been endorsing Arab states that recognised Israel, furthermore he was promoting the same agenda in #Pakistan as well. So called "Pakistani delegation" that met Israeli leadership should be punished. #Palestine 
By the end of Israel's Independence Day, around 1,000 Jews had ascended to the Temple Mount, four times as many as those who had ascended on the last Independence Day before the pandemic.  Read more 👉   #TempleMount #Israel #Jerusalem #Judaism
@betterpakistan Why did top @PTVNewsOfficial anchor visit #Israel with this delegation? Was he representing the state or did he go in personal capacity? Please also clarify this to strengthen your stance. #امپورٹڈ_حکومت_نامنظور
