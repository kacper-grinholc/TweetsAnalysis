Each time when there is news about how #Israel refused to give weapons to #Ukraine, #antisemitism increases in Ukraine with online #HateSpeech. Many proposing to ban Hasidic Jews to enter #Uman for example. In the meantime, Israel provided lots of #HumanitarianAid to Ukraine. 
I’ve also given birth twice. While it was ages ago &amp; I recall just wanting to schluf, she finds the strength to shove #Israel under a bus. Other women will recall giving birth the day Naftali, Eyal &amp; Gilad were kidnapped &amp; murdered by #Hamas. That came before Israel’s “assault”. 
Why is #Israel so pro-#Russian? 
The Jerusalem Post spoke to about a dozen new immigrants from #Russia who have arrived in #Israel in the past few months and left for different reasons.

@jeff070 If it was early 1960s, Jerusalem (or East Jerusalem) was still in Jordan. After the unification and restitution of Jerusalem to Israeli sovereignty, travel was only possible through Nicosia or Istanbul. btw, to this day Lebanese clergy are all over #Israel, doing pastoral work.
The islands sit near the #Israeli port of Eilat. Anonymous sources claim the deal could ‘build trust’ between #Riyadh &amp; #TelAviv.    Trump brokered the so-called Abraham Accords in September 2020, which saw #Bahrain, the #UAE, &amp; #Morocco normalize ties with #Israel.
According to Axios, the White House has been mediating between #SaudiArabia, #Israel &amp; #Egypt to have the islands of Tiran &amp; Sanafir transferred from Egyptian to Saudi sovereignty.
In its desperate quest for a foreign policy win, the Biden administration appears to be trying to mimic Donald Trump by supposedly paving the way for the normalization of relations between #SaudiArabia &amp; #Israel.
