Israel deserved better 😫#Eurovision #Esc2022 #Israel 
Israeli ambassador to Morocco is challenged with fighting anti-Israel narratives #Israel #Morocco 
This impossible situation means Israel is always guilty in the view of some. #Israel doesn’t need to satisfy those critics, but trying to figure out how to deal with the anti-Israel reactions is one difficult challenge. #ShireenAbuAkleh   By: @sfrantzman  
Oh #Eurovision. I voted for #poland but a lot of the fun acts like #SanMarino #georgia and, especially, #Israel were robbed.
@swilkinsonbc 💔💔💔💔💔 #Israel is a terrorist state an apartheid regime 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬

@AmnestyNZ @amnesty @S_jazi @POTUS it shouldn't take the killing of an American/Palestinian journalist #ShirinAbuAqla for the #US to speak out against #Israel's apartheid against #Palestinians. Stop using your veto power at the #UNSC to prevent #Israel being held to account for crimes against humanity
#Israel builds new settler-only road near #Bethlehem, #Palestine 
@YosephHaddad @AlJazeera No one believes your nonsense and lies Yoseph the world knows what happened, the IDF shot and killed her just like the many other journalists and human rights activists they have killed so their warcrimes aren’t reported!! #IDFterrorists #IsraelCrimes #IsraeliWarCrimes #Israel 
AGREE OR DISAGREE?  "#Israel may have lost in the #media arena, but not in the #diplomatic arena, and that’s what’s important."  By @arik3000 
Here is yet another stark example of Palestinians using children as "Human Shields"   One man shoots a mortar shell into #Israel - the other is holding a group of children, knowing that this will keep the #IDF from shooting at them. 
i'm appalled by the unbridled #Israel #Jew hating on #Twitter those days, even for #Eurovision. Imagine someone entering your country, shooting/stabbing your family. Would you like if others shout "don't arrest the culprits, don't try to curb down those attacks, do nothing"?
Brilliant 👉 Irish politician and MP Richard Boyd Barrett calls out the International community's double standards, following Israel's killing of Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh #ShireenAbuAkleh #Palestine #IsraeliCrimes #Israel
Racist liars &amp; murderers : I hope I’ve accurately summed up your apartheid regime. #Israel 
I have never before been more disappointed in a #Eurovision semifinal. How TF did #Israel's powerbop not make it in when I have heard #Estonia's song multiple times by now and STILL cannot remember ANYTHING about it.
For first time since 2014, Israel fails to qualify for Eurovision final #Eurovision #Israel   
Israeli fire blamed for most journalists killed since 1992 #BDS #Israel 
If you support #Israel, you support racism.  Racial supremacism.  Apartheid.  State terrorism.  May you become a minority.  Of none. 
You need some extreme right wing twisted heads that include an illegal occupier &amp; war criminal  #Israel into #Eurovision  #esc2022 a deep rooted crusader  mentality perhaps 🤔

I hope next time #Israel qualifies will be when #Palestine 🇵🇸 will be a FREE COUNTRY #Eurovision 
Best news of the evening: #Israel is not part of the grand final on Saturday. Next year it’s hopefully not part of the competition #FreePalestine   #ESC2022 #12stig #makelovenotwar #SayNoToWar
But when has this #terroriststate, #Israel ever done the decent thing towards the indigenous people of the land it was forced upon through #terrorism? #Nakba
So so sorry for #MichaelBenDavid he deserved the finale!!! #Eurovision #EscIta2022 #Israel
.#Israel does not have the death penalty for the most heinous criminals, reflecting its morality—But, @RashidaTlaib, with zero evidence, alleges that Israel executed a journalist 
EUROVISION SONG CONTEST Semi Final 2 (Results)  Which means, we say #Arrivederci to: 🇨🇾 #Cyprus 🇬🇪 #Georgia 🇮🇪 #Ireland 🇮🇱 #Israel 🇲🇰 #NorthMacedonia 🇲🇹 #Malta 🇸🇲 #SanMarino 
It is still noted that the PM of #Israel   Tried to use his privileged position to MISLEAD the world about the source of the bullet.  The PM of Israel and their military - collectively tried to use an incorrect video/footage to BLAME #Palestine for the murder of their own blood! 
#Newsletter The Weekly Scandal: “Blow up the Supreme Court”  #SupremeCourt; #Israel; #ReligiousFreedom #democracy
Just #Israel and #malta wrong tonight. Usual 8 out of 10! Great show! #eurovision
for all the haters (usually radical muslims and their leftist friends) who want #israel banned from #Eurovision...You will then need to ban half the countries, like Azerbaijan (invading and killing Armenians), heck, even France who destabilized the whole Lybia...
So sad for #Israel. But very very happy #Romania is in the final!  Malta is out. Ireland also. Will Ireland come back in 2023? They really should try to send good music. Will Ireland become the new Netherlands (of the zero's/10's)?  😬🤔  #Eurovision #ESC2022
If this was in #Ukraine, the Pope, Biden, Johnson, Macron, Zelenskyy, Elvis Presley &amp; Mr Blobby would be screaming “war crime”.   But it’s #israel again and America’s puppy cannot be tarnished 
#Eurovision y'all really like ballads huh....😞 #sanmarino #ireland #israel #georgia
Seriously, #Eurovision? No #Israel? Could the song be better? 🤦🏻‍♀️ You are killing me, I’m gonna miss them, #Latvia and #Austria so much…
@kennardmatt Everyone knows that #Israel is an #Apartheid Country The only openly #Racist country But nobody will say anything Why? Former Pakistani Foreign Minister SMQ says on @CNN #DeepPockets
Why didn't #Israel got ti the final? #Eurovision 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Sad for #ireland also #Serbia ? Like come on. #israel even deserved a place. This is a joke  @Eurovision
Justice for #israel #eurovision
@GiveMePatient Chao #Israel #IsraeliCrimes #FreePalestine #Eurovision
Israel didn’t win? And Finland did? Fucking bullshit. #eurovision #israel #eurovisionisrael #israeleurovision
@CNN @SkyNews @BBCNews The hypocrites that are the western media describe Russian tactics as “brutal, barbaric, targeting civilians” etc but when #Israel does this to Palestinians then no mention of these words at all. #IsraeliWarCrimes #IsraeliCrimes #ApartheidIsrael #Ukraine️
Sorry to disagree  Most of us are FULLY aware of the so called "context" but is does make any easier to hear the daily crap from "journalists" and "activists" ... #Qatar preaching human rights to #Israel ? 1000 x F M !!! 
When will the decent Members of Congress and voters of MI-13, who are forced to endure @RashidaTlaib’s #antisemitic calumnies against the free, democratic, and law-abiding State of #Israel finally say: “Enough”? 
The #Palestinian Authority rejected #Israel’s request to conduct a joint investigation into the “assassination” of journalist #ShireenAbuAkleh and refused to hand over the bullet that killed her, Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Hussein al-Sheikh confirmed on Thursday.
