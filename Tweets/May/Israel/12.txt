Why go to the ends of the galaxy for a black hole while the biggest black hole exists in our hearts as we have let a blood thirsty, colonial, murderous regime #Israel illegally occupy. Dehumanize and kill #Palestinians 
NEW: a video investigation shows Palestinians running from the area where Al-Jazeera‚Äôs journalist was killed, claiming other Palestinians injured a soldier. No soldier was injured on that day! #Jenin #ShireenAbuAkleh  #Israel @IsraelinUSA @AviMayer @Imamofpeace @benshapiro

Fuck Israel for being the ones who are taking others place and fuck people like you for supporting this fucking israel You fucking islamophobics, racist #Islamophobia #Israel  #FreePalestine 
@IsraelMFA @Israel You know that even if a clear, indep investigation shows theüáÆüá±army has nothing to do with it, Westerners -who have sadly become uneducated sheep-already have their vision of "who's the good &amp;who's bad". Kindergarten politics. They do it w/ #Ukraine, they'll do it with #Israel.1/2
Why some Americans political analysts are mentioning that journalists has also been killed in #Ukrain too, but don‚Äôt want to mention that #Israel is an occupying  army.  #ShireenAbuAkleh
@ZohranKMamdani @SocialistVoice I bet you a pound or a pinch of shit if that was in Ukraine and a Russian sniper killed a Journalist the west will be all over it like a rash. #Israel #WarCrimes

@PressSec #US  give #israel full coverage of their crimes. #Shereen_Abu_Aqleh  What a shame
Yet your statement didn't even mention #Israel as the perpetrator of the crime, @simoncoveney @dfatirl.  #ShereenAbuAqleh RIP  Jonathan Sugarman #Ireland @JewishPeace #Jews for #FreePalestine #Gaza Against #IsraeliCrimes  #Eurovision2022 #EUROVISION

This impossible situation means Israel is always guilty in the view of some. #Israel doesn‚Äôt need to satisfy those critics, but trying to figure out how to deal with the anti-Israel reactions is one difficult challenge. #ShireenAbuAkleh   By: @sfrantzman  
Oh #Eurovision. I voted for #poland but a lot of the fun acts like #SanMarino #georgia and, especially, #Israel were robbed.

@AmnestyNZ @amnesty @S_jazi @POTUS it shouldn't take the killing of an American/Palestinian journalist #ShirinAbuAqla for the #US to speak out against #Israel's apartheid against #Palestinians. Stop using your veto power at the #UNSC to prevent #Israel being held to account for crimes against humanity
#Israel builds new settler-only road near #Bethlehem, #Palestine 
@YosephHaddad @AlJazeera No one believes your nonsense and lies Yoseph the world knows what happened, the IDF shot and killed her just like the many other journalists and human rights activists they have killed so their warcrimes aren‚Äôt reported!! #IDFterrorists #IsraelCrimes #IsraeliWarCrimes #Israel 
AGREE OR DISAGREE?  "#Israel may have lost in the #media arena, but not in the #diplomatic arena, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important."  By @arik3000 
Here is yet another stark example of Palestinians using children as "Human Shields"   One man shoots a mortar shell into #Israel - the other is holding a group of children, knowing that this will keep the #IDF from shooting at them. 
i'm appalled by the unbridled #Israel #Jew hating on #Twitter those days, even for #Eurovision. Imagine someone entering your country, shooting/stabbing your family. Would you like if others shout "don't arrest the culprits, don't try to curb down those attacks, do nothing"?
Brilliant üëâ Irish politician and MP Richard Boyd Barrett calls out the International community's double standards, following Israel's killing of Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh #ShireenAbuAkleh #Palestine #IsraeliCrimes #Israel
Racist liars &amp; murderers : I hope I‚Äôve accurately summed up your apartheid regime. #Israel 
I have never before been more disappointed in a #Eurovision semifinal. How TF did #Israel's powerbop not make it in when I have heard #Estonia's song multiple times by now and STILL cannot remember ANYTHING about it.
For first time since 2014, Israel fails to qualify for Eurovision final #Eurovision #Israel   
Israeli fire blamed for most journalists killed since 1992 #BDS #Israel 
If you support #Israel, you support racism.  Racial supremacism.  Apartheid.  State terrorism.  May you become a minority.  Of none. 
You need some extreme right wing twisted heads that include an illegal occupier &amp; war criminal  #Israel into #Eurovision  #esc2022 a deep rooted crusader  mentality perhaps ü§î

It is still noted that the PM of #Israel   Tried to use his privileged position to MISLEAD the world about the source of the bullet.  The PM of Israel and their military - collectively tried to use an incorrect video/footage to BLAME #Palestine for the murder of their own blood!

Just #Israel and #malta wrong tonight. Usual 8 out of 10! Great show! #eurovision
for all the haters (usually radical muslims and their leftist friends) who want #israel banned from #Eurovision...You will then need to ban half the countries, like Azerbaijan (invading and killing Armenians), heck, even France who destabilized the whole Lybia...
So sad for #Israel. But very very happy #Romania is in the final!  Malta is out. Ireland also. Will Ireland come back in 2023? They really should try to send good music. Will Ireland become the new Netherlands (of the zero's/10's)?  üò¨ü§î  #Eurovision #ESC2022

Sorry to disagree  Most of us are FULLY aware of the so called "context" but is does make any easier to hear the daily crap from "journalists" and "activists" ... #Qatar preaching human rights to #Israel ? 1000 x F M !!! 
When will the decent Members of Congress and voters of MI-13, who are forced to endure @RashidaTlaib‚Äôs #antisemitic calumnies against the free, democratic, and law-abiding State of #Israel finally say: ‚ÄúEnough‚Äù? 
The #Palestinian Authority rejected #Israel‚Äôs request to conduct a joint investigation into the ‚Äúassassination‚Äù of journalist #ShireenAbuAkleh and refused to hand over the bullet that killed her, Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Hussein al-Sheikh confirmed on Thursday.
