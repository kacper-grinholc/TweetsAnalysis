Israel accuses Russia of committing horrific war crimes.  It is true that Russia has committed awful crimes.  But has Israel looked at it's own record in the committing of war crimes?  Hmm.  #UkraineUnderAttack 🇺🇦  #PalestineUnderAttack 🇵🇸  #Israel

Axios reports that a senior #Israeli official said #Israel is indeed considering increasing #military #Supplies to #Ukraine, and is likely to do so in the #future. They stressed, however, that the Israeli #government will only provide non-lethal #equipment.
#Israel to consider increasing #military #Supplies to #Ukraine, according to Axios.  The #Israeli #occupation sent the head of the #ministry of #security's #political-military bureau, Dror Shalon, to #USA #Ramstein Air Base in #Germany for talks on sending #weapons to #Ukraine.
So far, #Israel has refused #Ukrainian #requests for advanced weaponry to be delivered, but the #Israeli #government is signaling it is gradually becoming more open to supplying #Ukraine with non-lethal #military #equipment.  Last week, the #Biden #Administration asked

Even as Jewish #antiZionism seems to be intensifying, in particular among the younger generations in America, anti-Zionist Jews constitute a small minority of our people. The majority of the world’s Jews already — or will soon — live in #Israel.
The #Torah establishes two foundational principles: nationhood and national territory. These two foundational principles of Judaism — nationhood in the Land of #Israel — accompanied us throughout the centuries of dispersion.
