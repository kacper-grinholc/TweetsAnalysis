Israel must not build the more than 4,000 settler homes, plans for which were advanced this week, fourteen European nations said in a joint statement they issued on Friday.  By @tovahlazaroff:  #WestBank | #Israel
This is what #west support?! This is #Israel and #IsraeliApartheid 
There’s a JOURNALIST AMERICAN citizen inside that coffin. The Israeli @Israel  government murdered her and didn’t even allow her to be buried peacefully.  The American government and press are not outraged bcs the victim are also Palestinian.  #palestine #Israel #warcrimes 
@boz1156 He won’t and he and many others won’t apologise for wronging #Israel 🇮🇱

@HeidiBachram @DavidLammy @LBC Because .@DavidLammy's addiction to harming #Israel needed a fix. Like all addictions lol
If you can’t get to an event to mark International Conscientious Objectors' Day tomorrow (Sunday), you can join the livestream  at 1pm from Tavistock Square in London, hearing from #Israel, #Russia, #Ukraine, #Turkey and of course the UK.  #CODay 
Oh no! Israel’s entry has ripped his sleeves! Someone get that man a sewing kit quick! (I guess Italy ran out of those pink dresses and drippy silver outfits 👀) #Eurovision #Israel  
It’s amazing to see so many Azerbaijani people support Israel’s entry especially as LGBT+ rights are far and few between over there 💖 #Eurovision #Israel 
#israel is this one of your #falseflags to divert the attention away from killin Palestinian American journalist &amp; throwing in the shooter an #antisemitic? For real, askin for ...well just asking. 
Talking of Israel’s performance, anyone else love the part where they dance Squidward with their arms? 👀😂 #Eurovision #Israel  
I definitely wish I had Israel’s entry’s confidence 🥺 though I also wish he was wearing heels in his performance, it just feels like dancing heels would go perfectly in this song (especially as I can imagine this on RuPaul’s Drag Race) #Eurovision #Israel 
Lifie is circle  #UkrianeWar #Russia  #Israel 
Next up! Israel! Their entry is basically the definition of “yasssss queen! Slay!” If you looked it up in a dictionary 🤔 it was definitely 1 of my favourites, especially with its chorus, though the flute part reminds me of another song I can’t think of 😵‍💫 #Eurovision #Israel
#Israel like #nazis 
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT EUROPE!!🤍💥 #Eurovision #EurovisionRTVE #Chanel #ITA #Israel #Ukraine 
Hear hear! 💙🕎💙 #Israel #Zionist #Zionism 
If you had total immunity and could behave with absolute impunity like the #Aprartheid state of #Israel, what politicians &amp; journalists would you include in your list for extrajuditial killing?

. #Russia is excluded from the #Eurovision but #Israel isn't. Because it's normal to shoot and kill journalists, level entire neighbourhoods, bomb neighboring countries, and expel #Palestinians from their homes. #Hypocrisy #DoubleStandards International Rules Based Order.
First Qibla of Muslim was #AlAqsaMosque but except some all have forget the value and highness of #AlAqsaUnderAttack Stand for #Palestine Stop #Apartheid #Israel @nytimes
