Btw, US Tax dollars funded  &amp; enabled the terror show during  #ShireenAbuAkleh ‚Äòs funeral. A fact.  #Israel
#Israel lies do not work anymore. It's a matter of time before #IsraeliCrimes are brought to #ICC. #ICC4ISRAEL #ApartheidIsrael 
@_AhmedQuraishi A palestinian journalist (Al-Jazeera) was killed just recently possibly when u were in #Israel. Hopefully, u would have raised ur voice against their govt fascist policies or were u too impressed by Israeli hospitality. They even attacked the pallbearers. #IsraeliApartheid
Ask yourself who owns the media. This will answer the lack of coverage. #Israel  #palastine 
@LawrenceD72 @Katy_Tel_Aviv @simoncoveney @dfatirl @irishmissionun @MichealMartinTD I was quoted @simoncoveney tonight but I knew the #Truth and left the individual in no doubt that @simoncoveney made no effort to establish the facts before demonising #Israel  Not just on SM but in the real world we have to share the #Truth about #Israel üáÆüá±
US condemns Israel‚Äôs attack on Shireen Abu Aqleh‚Äôs funeral. This is @DNC performativity. Words are cheap. Cut all funding to #Zionist state of #Israel. Fund COVID relief, free college, student debt relief @senschumer @RepRitchie! #BDS @Cuny4P @paulinepark 
Imagine dehumanizing people so much that you think terrorizing a funeral is the right thing to do.  Something to think about while u read the Israeli police bS statement.   #Israel  #ShireenAbuAkleh
Pleased not to see #Israel on #Eurovision2022   We can avoid the discomfort of watching them singing after the disgusting scenes at the Abu Aqla funeral
.@RashidaTlaib: "For the Israeli apartheid govt, #ShireenAbuAkleh's life didn't matter - and her dehumanization continues after death."  #Israel #Palestine
This is pure terrorism. This is inhuman. #Israel 
#Israel can do no harm. Never! 
Can't #Israel just fuck off and disappear up its own arse? 
The health of the Palestinian prisoner Khalil Awawda is quickly deteriorating, after he passed the 70th day of his hunger strike earlier this week.  Awawda, 40, is protesting his continued detention in Israeli prisons without trial or charge. *** #WestBank #Palestine #Israel 
When has #Israel gone too far? When did Hitler go too far? Impunity for Israel‚Äôs #Execution of a #Catholic #American citizen ‚Äî- does that merit $3.8 Billion/yr US taxpayer support?   #NeverAgain #HumanityComesFirst #ApartheidIsrael must end. 
Or #Israel for that matter? #ShireenAbuAkleh #ShireenAbuAqla 
#IsraeliPolice joins in #Eurovision or #FACupFinal  This is #Israel by the way... Disgusting! 
Israel must not build the more than 4,000 settler homes, plans for which were advanced this week, fourteen European nations said in a joint statement they issued on Friday.  By @tovahlazaroff:  #WestBank | #Israel
This is what #west support?! This is #Israel and #IsraeliApartheid 
There‚Äôs a JOURNALIST AMERICAN citizen inside that coffin. The Israeli @Israel  government murdered her and didn‚Äôt even allow her to be buried peacefully.  The American government and press are not outraged bcs the victim are also Palestinian.  #palestine #Israel #warcrimes 
@boz1156 He won‚Äôt and he and many others won‚Äôt apologise for wronging #Israel üáÆüá±

#Israel's Colonial #Fascism in action.   
@TomsMom1997 I have watched this video again and again #Israel #IsraelPolice are not only sub-human they r üôà üëø disgrace to their #Jewish religion &amp;star of David #ShireenAbuAkleh will live forever ‚ôæÔ∏è 
Who killed Shireen Abu Akleh ? The proof is in the map and video footage , no need for bullet proof #israel #Palestine #Ireland 
So #Israel being held to a higher standard than others #Eurovision  I see
@HeidiBachram @DavidLammy @LBC Because .@DavidLammy's addiction to harming #Israel needed a fix. Like all addictions lol
If you can‚Äôt get to an event to mark International Conscientious Objectors' Day tomorrow (Sunday), you can join the livestream  at 1pm from Tavistock Square in London, hearing from #Israel, #Russia, #Ukraine, #Turkey and of course the UK.  #CODay 
Oh no! Israel‚Äôs entry has ripped his sleeves! Someone get that man a sewing kit quick! (I guess Italy ran out of those pink dresses and drippy silver outfits üëÄ) #Eurovision #Israel  
It‚Äôs amazing to see so many Azerbaijani people support Israel‚Äôs entry especially as LGBT+ rights are far and few between over there üíñ #Eurovision #Israel 
#israel is this one of your #falseflags to divert the attention away from killin Palestinian American journalist &amp; throwing in the shooter an #antisemitic? For real, askin for ...well just asking. 
Talking of Israel‚Äôs performance, anyone else love the part where they dance Squidward with their arms? üëÄüòÇ #Eurovision #Israel  
I definitely wish I had Israel‚Äôs entry‚Äôs confidence ü•∫ though I also wish he was wearing heels in his performance, it just feels like dancing heels would go perfectly in this song (especially as I can imagine this on RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race) #Eurovision #Israel 
Lifie is circle  #UkrianeWar #Russia  #Israel 
Next up! Israel! Their entry is basically the definition of ‚Äúyasssss queen! Slay!‚Äù If you looked it up in a dictionary ü§î it was definitely 1 of my favourites, especially with its chorus, though the flute part reminds me of another song I can‚Äôt think of üòµ‚Äçüí´ #Eurovision #Israel
#Israel like #nazis 
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT EUROPE!!ü§çüí• #Eurovision #EurovisionRTVE #Chanel #ITA #Israel #Ukraine 
Hear hear! üíôüïéüíô #Israel #Zionist #Zionism 
If you had total immunity and could behave with absolute impunity like the #Aprartheid state of #Israel, what politicians &amp; journalists would you include in your list for extrajuditial killing?

. #Russia is excluded from the #Eurovision but #Israel isn't. Because it's normal to shoot and kill journalists, level entire neighbourhoods, bomb neighboring countries, and expel #Palestinians from their homes. #Hypocrisy #DoubleStandards International Rules Based Order.
First Qibla of Muslim was #AlAqsaMosque but except some all have forget the value and highness of #AlAqsaUnderAttack Stand for #Palestine Stop #Apartheid #Israel @nytimes
