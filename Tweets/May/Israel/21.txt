@edokonrad @hebh_jamal 1. 😔 Yes, it is crazy that they are celebrating Nakba (catastrophe) of the Palestinian-Arab refugees who fled Mandatory Palestine as a result of the 1948 war launched by multiple Arab states with the goal of destroying #Israel.

She has a point 👍 Many people in the World and more specifically the Western World view Israel 🇮🇱 as the oppressor and Palestinians 🇵🇸 as the oppressed. Specially the leftists. That's why any time such unfortunate incidents occurs they react emotionally. #Israel #Palestine

@Vbiruta @pritipatel British Home Secretary Priti Patel shamelessly branded pro-Palestine @BDSmovement "racist".  Ironic, given she enforces racist anti-immigration policies, plus praises notorious anti-Arab racist, Israel Envoy Tzipi Hotovely.  #PritiPatel #Israel #BDS

My take on what may happen with #COVID19 in #Israel in the near future- Yes, I know you are bored of COVID and no I am not switching to Monkey Pox- I'm an ID epidemiologist- doesn't make me a #monkeypox expert 
Israel has reported its first confirmed case of monkeypox, which officials expected would be contained. The case is a man in his 30s who had returned from a trip in western Europe. He is now under quarantine at a medical center and has mild conditions. #Israel #monkeypox

Would the regular #Jerusalem Day march route provoke tensions? Or would re-routing the march be seen as a capitulation to terror? That’s the decision #Israel PM @naftalibennett needs to make before next Sunday… @WIONews
