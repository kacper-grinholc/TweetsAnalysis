@HMcPhersonMP @bellingcat Where is the Palestinian leadership which has failed its people for years? Where is the #Islamic world? Where is #Turkey? #UAE? #Egypt? #SaudiArabia? Where?
#Russia has lowered its rhetoric over #Finland and #Sweden joining #NATO strangely and coincidentally #Turkey who are strong trading “friends” of #Putin are bitterly opposing their joining, if it looks like xxxx and smells like xxxx it most likely is !!
Quite agree.  Thought it was too good to be true that #Turkey was raising no objections to #Sweden  and #FINLAND joining.  I genuinely don't think they are compatible with #NATO.  Most of the country is not in #Europe, and they are a long way from the #Atlantic. 
America and its double standard is legendary 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️. I’m convinced Biden will deploy more than 10k troops to Israel should Palestinians form a tough resistance to terrorist Israel aggression 😂😂 #Zionist #terroristisrael #turkey
Harsh words. Hard to see how #Erdogan can say such things and _not_ use #Turkey's veto to stop #Sweden and #Finland from joining #NATO  Or is it Turkey's days in NATO that are numbered? It's one of the only genuinely militarily and geographically useful members. 
⚡️#Sweden 🇸🇪 will now officially apply to join #NATO 🇺🇸🇪🇺🇨🇦 after 200 years of #Neutrality. Although #Turkey 🇹🇷 says they will block any admission from Sweden 🇸🇪 to join NATO 🇺🇸🇪🇺🇨🇦 but official’s believe they will be able to work something out dispute Turkey’s 🇹🇷 objection.
Some jihadi #Chechens in #Turkey attacked a police chief of #RamzanKadyrov forces... #Chechen jihadis recorded a video of the incident. Video on my telegram channel.  
Will #Turkey veto #Finland/#Sweden joining NATO? I don't think so. Turkey's standing in NATO has improved amid #UkraineWar. I doubt Turkey wants to be isolated in NATO. Yet Ankara can use this leverage to first get some concessions from these Nordic countries before saying yes.
#Turkey is filled with sadism against #Dogs. @RTErdogan is a disgusting, inept dictator under who dogs &amp; children get raped &amp; people starve with 80% inflation. No #AnimalRights no #HumanRights just fascists &amp; cave dwellers. Revolting nation thanks to #Erdogan @TurkishEmbassy

Turkish Foreign Minister to Visit US on May 16-19, Hold Talks With US Sec of State   The ministry specified that Cavusoglu will hold the first foreign ministerial meeting of the #US-#Turkey Strategic Mechanism with Blinken &amp; will meet with the Turkish-American community in #NY
In addition, Sweden has imposed an embargo on #Turkey over military operations in Syria. A military pact (#NATO) is based on trust, respect and common interests. That's why Turkey's veto opt is justifiable. #Erdogan

#Turkey does not have to agree what EU, USA, Sweden or Finland wants. I think the facts are obvious &amp; Turkey is absolutely right to vote against the membership of #Sweden &amp; #Finland  It must be hard to feel being excluded from a party. Well, like Turkey did &gt;40 years. #NATO 🤦🏻‍♂️
I am sure that the President #Erdogan  is not so weak, that he allows a young woman #SannaMarin and her gay minister #PekkaHaavisto to manipulate to say "yes" to Finland's #NATO application. He understands that #Russia is more important partner than #Sweden and #Finland.  #Turkey

@VviewSsonicMair This was always a part of the #NATO game plan. #Turkey was in it. The idea was to goad Russian into a troop build up on the north western frontiers with a bluff.  The Russians didn't fall for it, so this is an off-ramp.  The game is much more sophisticated than we see.
#Turkey's Erdogan continues to blackmail #NATO over #Sweden and #Finland joining the organisation. I'm sure I speak for all Swedes when I say: we're still not going to have our security policies dictated to us by semi-dictators like that piece of shit Erdogan. 🇸🇪🇪🇺
#Turkey does NOT stand with #NATO .   Just like #Russia does NOT stand with the United Nations Security Council.   Of course, neither do the #GOPDomesticTerrorists   Erdogan says Swedish, Finnish delegations should not bother coming to Turkey

Turkey says it will not approve Sweden and Finland joining Nato  #Ukraine #UkraineUnderAttack #Turkey #Erdogan  
@doc7austin @Hindustan2369 It might be possible, if #Turkey is considered in breach of Article 2 and/or 10. Turkey has been warned about this before, in 2016.
First demands, then haggling, then deal. Watch it happen live.  🇹🇷🤝🇫🇮🇸🇪  #Erdogan #Finland #Sweden #Turkey #NATO 
Greatest fear of every #Turk #Azeri #Turkey #Azerbaijan is that wherever they go, any group of people they talk, any social gathering they participate, there is always someone who will ask them or question them about #Armenian #Genocide they committed and they have nothing to say

If #Turkey &amp; #Erdogan don’t want #Finland &amp; #Sweden to join @NATO the simple solution is to remove #Turkey! One country cannot be allowed to dictate over the other 29 #StrongerTogether

Finland and Sweden should remove the PKK and add #Turkey to the terror list.

Not #PKK #Kurds are the terrorists but #Turkey #NATO  #Sweden #Finland 
🇸🇪#Sweden gave the weapons to PKK/YPG in Syria that it did not give to #Turkey   🇸🇪and also that 15 associations were operating in #Sweden 
"countries supporting terrorism should not be allies in nato", says çavuşoğlu. did anybody mention #isis already? #turkey's well documented and broad range support for isis, i mean? 
Is there a protocol for booting out a nation? But I figure Turkey will get its payout.  “#Erdoğan says #Turkey will not approve Finnish and Swedish membership of #Nato” 
#NATO #TURKEY #USA #FRANCE #GERMANY #SPAIN #ICELAND  '..If Turkey is not happy with our decision, she can leave NATO..We don't need her.. If she wants F-16 from USA ..well the answer is obvious NO!..Of course she can get planes and tanks from Putin!..' European Parliamentarianian
@ClaesGustafss66 that is something for #Turkey to resolve with #JensStoltenberg. Turkey is a LONG-TIME member, and the rules say ANY member can veto new joiners, so Turkey is merely acting in accordance with the rules. If the rules need amending, then that is a matter for NATO, not candidates.
Is Turkey standing by #Putin's side? Is #Erdogan Putin's bootlicker? There is no other explanation for the blockade of #Sweden and #Finland, because #Turkey itself offers support and protection to #terrorist groups.
#Turkey is preparing to manage #security for the duration of the 2022 #FIFA #WorldCup with 3000 riot police, 100 members of special forces unit, 50 bomb-detection dogs &amp; their handlers, 50 bomb disposal experts and other staff.   via @middleeastmnt
US Backs #Sweden and #Finland Move Toward @NATO Why Won't #Turkey? 
FM Haavisto &amp; FM Cavusoglu have met frequently &amp; no mention of prob. 4.4 Pres. Niinistö &amp; Pres. Erdogan call: Nob prob,🇹🇷 supports 🇫🇮 to NATO 13.5: 🇹🇷 no to 🇫🇮 to NATO 14.5: 🇹🇷okay for 🇫🇮 to NATO. 16.5 🇹🇷no again. What gives? No mention before and now this? #Turkey #NATO #Finland
We all know how appeasement led #Russia to invade #Ukraine. Except for @jensstoltenberg who continues to eat where #Turkey spits. Shameless &amp; shameful.
