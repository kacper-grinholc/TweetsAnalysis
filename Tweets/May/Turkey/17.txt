#NATO and the United States said they were confident #Turkey would not hold up membership of #Finland and #Sweden.
“They are coming to #Turkey on Monday. Are they coming to convince us? Excuse me but they should not tire themselves," #Erdogan said about the planned visit.
In a news conference on Monday, #Erdogan repeated that #Turkey would not approve their bids to join #NATO, calling #Sweden a "hatchery" for terrorist organisations, and adding it had terrorists in its parliament.
#Turkey surprised its #NATO allies last week by saying it would not view their applications positively, mainly citing their history of hosting members of groups Ankara deems terrorists.

If Turkey opposes the membership of Finland and Sweden into then Turkey should've thrown out. Turkey is nothing more than a caliphate now anyway. No harm. No foul #Turkey  #Sweden  #cdnpoli  #JustinTrudeau
Final verdict: 7 years of imprisonment for being a member of “terror” group  Incriminating evidence on the file: attending Gulen group’s religious study meetings, reading Quran, praying 5 times a day  No, this is not a rarity, just one example among thousands in Erdogan’s #Turkey
