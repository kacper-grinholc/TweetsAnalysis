#Turkey needs to create a "safe zone" up to 30 km wide to protect its legitimate rights and provide shelter for 3 million #Refugees!  Therefore, a new operation to combine existing areas is inevitable.  The PKK is on the UN's list of terrorist organizations. 
In addition, Assad's army withdrew from northern #Syria without conflict.  After Assad's move against #Turkey, the YPG Terrorist Organization became the dominant force in Afrin, Kobani and Qamishli, and #YPG flags were hung on the #Turkish border!
