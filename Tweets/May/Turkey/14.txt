@DOualaalou Let's see whether #USA #UK &amp; the rest of #NATO will let #Turkey stand in the way of #Finland &amp; #Sweden joining. Then #Turkey will realize where it stands amongst the #European countries, &amp; why it has not been accepted into #EU. Btw further expansion of NATO will only cause wars!
Question for global affairs experts...  Is the reason for which #Turkey is suddenly losing its mind about #Finland joining #NATO because Finland's military rivals Turkey's in ability, and Erdogan wants to be the only big dog on the European continent?
