A pro-Erdogan Turkish account accidentally revivals the heavy support Kurdish rebels enjoy by the rapidly growing #Kurdish population in south eastern #Turkey.  A Kurdish semi-autonomous region has already been established in Iraq, and another one is under works in northern Syria 
Few in #Turkey are aware that the country's second biggest #naturalgas supplier over the past winter was the United States, which shipped it in to meet Turkey's high winter gas demand 
Also I need to add one more thing when we think about the long cooperation of the terrorist organization LTTE with the terrorist organization #pkk, this means that these Kashmiris do support terrorism in #Turkey.
What is occuring in Northern #Iraq between militias and the military is an unwanted necessity.  Either #Baghdad #Iraq integrate or dissolve militias, or #Turkey will.  Those complaining, have a good heart, but no brains.
