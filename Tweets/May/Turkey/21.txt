Give them the opportunity to acquire their own state.  They will thank you unselfishly and support you without compensation, unlike #Turkey, which always demands compensation.  #Finlandia #Finlande #FinlandNATO #SwedenNATO #Sweden #NATO #politico #WarInUkraine #RussiaUkraineWar
from the #Law_of_the_Sea and #International_Law. Stop them. Ignore them.  Give a chance to a people like the #Kurds to prove to you that they are not terrorists, as arrogant #Turkey calls them.  They are people with values, ideals and faith in the Republic.
a lower cost and beneficial to all. Think about it seriously.  The establishment of a Kurdish state is a guarantee of stability and security in the #Middle_East.  #Turkey, whether #Islamic or #Kemalist, will never cease to have an #Ottoman and #nationalist orientation.

#Turkey. The country that uses #NATO not for allied reasons, which stem from the values ​​of Western civilization as #Finland and #Sweden want to do,  but to provide benefits in its own interest by blackmailing other countries.  And do we accept this without protest?
One may like #Erdogan or not, anyway #Turkey's government is defending its legitimate national interest. #Sweden and #Finland can't just join #NATO preserving their somewhat sympathetic, peaceful &amp; neutral image. It's a political choice.
