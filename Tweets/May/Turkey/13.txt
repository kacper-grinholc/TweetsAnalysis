@JoeNBC Looking at a map, how is #Turkey even a member of #NATO ?
#Turkey wields a lot of influence in the ME, Africa, Asia, the Balkans and the former Soviet republics. It is a regional power with a projected global influence. Most of it is soft power. One could say the same of #Russia.
I think Turkey should remember that it is not the same country it was when it joined NATO. It is no longer suitable as a NATO ally considering it's deep ties to Russia. #turkey #nato

@AndrewNovo #Turkey does not conform with the founding values of #NATO... It's time to clean up the house. For way too long the West has had an indulgent position on Turkey. Russia showing so much weakness makes Turkey disposable.
President Recep Erdogan has said it is not possible for #NATO-member #Turkey to support #Sweden and #Finland joining the transatlantic military alliance in the wake of #Russia’s invasion of #Ukraine, signalling a possible blockade to their anticipated ascension bids. - @AJEnglish 
Ideological fight on #refugees and their return!   #Turkey #Syria #geopolitics  
@Roxiefoxie_ @RTErdogan @Turkey_Gov The EU paid for stopping the flow but still they came. Terrorists as well. Then #Turkey required more money. Mafia country. At the edge wr live w/ Turkey.
Erdogan should apologize for including Finland in such statement about terrorism! Finland is one of the safest countries in the world with MINIMUM risks of terrorism organisations! #NATO #Turkey
Maybe strongman #Erdoğan will pull #Turkey out of #Nato in protest? With all the #Russian missiles systems he bought and having #DrOz in the #Turkish Army, does he really need #NATO to ward off #Putin’s aggression? 
@NATO can we skip #Turkey as member and welcome #Finland and #Sweden? #erdogan is a friend of #Putin and therefore dangerous
@LucasFoxNews Sitrep 1. #Hungary declines sanction on #Russian oil and gas 2. #Turkey objects on #Finland and #Sweden joining #NATO 3. #Ukraine will not join Nato, says Zelenskky 4. #RandPaul objection delays $40 billion dollar aid to Ukraine.   Like for #Russia Retweet for Ukraine
Germany has no plans to change PKK ban: spokesperson   --- #Intelligence #Germany #PKK #Kurd #Turkey #Erbil #Europe #Terrorism    
@oryxspioenkop its easy to know Why #Erdogan opposes letting #Finland, #Sweden join #NATO ? 1/ inorder to please #Putin  2/ #Erdogan against Strong #NATO  #Turkey is the best #Russian ally , so do what putin wish be happen 😎
@WillHurd @HellenicLeaders #turkey is an undemocratic country. Let’s rethink their @nato status and either place them on probation, or kick them out.
Finland denounced when Turkey launched an expulsion operation against terrorists. Sweden, on the other hand, is preparing 376 million dollars in aid for the year 2023 for the PKK, which is officially a terrorist organization.   #Turkey #NATO #Sweden #Finland #Erdogan
@DrOz Why should anyone vote for you? After all, you refuse to acknowledge the #ArmenianGenocide perpetuated by your country, #Turkey, against the #Armenians.
Turkish President #RecepTayyipErdogan said Friday that his country is “not favorable” toward #Finland &amp; #Sweden joining #NATO, indicating that #Turkey could use its status as a member of the Western military..  This article was fact checked by #Oigetit ✅   
Supporting separatism on your potential #NATO ally’s territory means purposefully undermining the organization’s security and walking away from the defense doctrine of this organization. #Turkey shouldn’t allow #Sweden &amp; #Finland to join NATO until these counties stop supporting
#Turkey from the North West, #USA from the North East and East, and #Israel from the West is surrounding #Syria to capture its fertile land and oilfields, whilst #Russia is distracted in #Ukraine. #Muslims of West Asia  are disunited contrary to Quran (3:105) = Big penalty.  
If an authoritarian nation like #Turkey can block democracies like #Sweden and #Finland from joining #NATO, it might be time to rethink our membership requirements. #Erdogan #Russia #Ukraine 
@Roxiefoxie_ @RTErdogan @Turkey_Gov Sarcastic comment. Could we say #Turkey is trustworthy when not saying anything about the same enemy dealing w/ the major power country?  Turkey is b/w the narrow walls just collecting enemy by enemy. Not cooperative. Germany is on its toes due to immigration pushed by Turkey.

@BucakMeb @FT #Turkey should go arrest Bashar Al Assad and give the Kurd's a Kurdistan in Syria they are pro Democracy usually
#Turkey Further Away from #EU Values, #EuropeanParliament Report Says 
#Turkey Bombarded Assad/#Iran Regimes in #Syria  @IdlibEn #TSK bombarded with heavy artillery the positions of the Syrian regime forces and the Iranian militias on the fronts of the western countryside of #Aleppo. 
Turns out other countries can play hardball as well. As #Turkey s EU application has gone nowhere, understandable
#Somalia people, one of the most successful examples of #Turkey's foreign policy and deep-rooted relations, will go to the polls on May 15 for the #presidential elections, which are expected to bring radical changes for the country.

#Turkey's main opposition CHP leader Kemal Kııçdaroğlu has said that "if anything happens to shake the security” of the upcoming 2023 general elections, the government-linked private military firm SADAT is to blame.
@TheWarMonitor #Turkey is a hole.
@HelloLauraKelly @thehill Erdogan will be more than happy to purchase MiGs from Russia at lower cost. #Turkey
Does Erdogan’s #Turkey fulfill #NATO democracy requirements?  “…the son of the Turkish president is the head of one of the largest energy companies and his son-in-law the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources?”  Mob is family business… #Corruption
