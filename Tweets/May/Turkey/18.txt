@POTUS You can support all you want and #Erdogan says "no" and then you have a #NATO where #Turkey is the leader and #Putin laughs at your face. Meanwhile we in #Finland will find some other way.
#NATO needs to tell #Turkey to sit down &amp; #STFU and if that's not acceptable they can withdraw from #NATO. 
#breakingnews ⚡️#Croatia to block Finland, Sweden from NATO membership.  Croatian President Zoran Milanovic said he would instruct the country’s permanent representative to #NATO to vote against the move. This follows thr same suit as #Turkey's President also said the same thing
@DrVirgo1981 Same. #Turkey, for example.
@0Eseven @LarryMatthew20 It is weird times!! But #Turkey agreed not to veto #Sweden &amp; #Finland into #NATO so the sooner that happens the better! We want to keep everyone safe; I know Germany wants no part of us. Why?? 🤔 from one friend to another. I won’t take it personally
#Erdogan #Turkey Erdogan, the islamic fascist. The turkish people are sleep.

Why is #Turkey causing problems for #Finland and #Sweden's plans to join #NATO?

@JanGilb33464730 Therefore I suggest a honest evaluation of your stance in the question of #Turkey's claims and their conditions for a "yes" regarding your countries #Nato application.
Is #Turkey the Joe Manchin of #NATO?
In my comments for @24UR  I pointed out that #Turkey 🇹🇷 was one of the fastest entrants to @NATO, because of threats from #Moscow. By threatening #Finland 🇫🇮 and #Sweden 🇸🇪, President #Putin is thus repeating the mistake of Generalissimus #Stalin. 👉  
#NATO and #Russia are equal in guilt considering the atrocities committed in the Middle East over the years. Both blocs are fundamentally colonial and imperialistic. Also I love that #Turkey — their token member — is giving them a hard time at the moment re #Finland / #Sweden.

#Turkey will not approve #Sweden's #NATO (@NATO) membership if the country does not extradite "terrorists" upon Turkish request, Turkish President #RecepTayyipErdogan (@RTErdogan) said. 
@JanGilb33464730 If #Sweden &amp; #Finland public / people would request a transparent &amp; public &amp; honest discussion about the claims of #Turkey I suppose it would mean the end of their current government. Don't talk only about democracy &amp; fairness but act also according this values.

Not unreasonably, #Turkey has demanded that #NATO respects its security concerns following the submissions of #Sweden and #Finland.   Now where have I heard that before?
But it is also important to stress that in light of the Russian invasion of #Ukraine and the danger of the scene on the borders of #Moldova, #Turkey must be more understanding and less demanding so that it does not understand its indirect support for #Russia.4/6 
Pull yourself together, Europe. You are offered to modern, strong, well organized armies to strenghten #NATO against #Russia fascism. Are you crazy to say NO? Shame on you, don't act like fools. This is not a time for cheap political games.  #Croatia #Turkey

It is necessary to emphasize that #Turkey has the right to set conditions that protect its national security, and it is not the first time that a NATO member has refused the accession of a new member. #Greece has banned Skopje from joining #NATO because of the name only.3/6 
You can bet Erdogan is asking Putin what he'll do for Turkey if he blocks the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO.  Turkey--and Erdogan's AK Parti more specifically--is a fifth column within NATO. #Turkey #Erdogan

In the file of the military industry, #Sweden announced in October 2019 a ban on the supply of arms and equipment that support the Turkish military industry. This ban is still valid today, so #Turkey wants to lift it.11/11
Therefore, Erdogan wants to take advantage of the accession of Sweden and Finland in NATO in exchange for obtaining western support to protect the safe areas in northern Syria, to rebuild them and encourage return of millions of Syrians from #Turkey.10/11
This popular tension in #Turkey because of the Syrian refugees prompted #Erdogan and his party a few weeks ago to announce plans to return about one million refugees to the north of #Syria through projects of rebuilding these areas.8/11

@elisabethbraw @RTErdogan This S A Kibbutz is yet another example of Putin’s trolls. Has joined Twitter a couple of months ago and has no followers. Get paid in “hard currency”, in rubles. That's why I'm blocking him/her. Bye!  #Russians #Turkey #Putin #TROLLS @RTErdogan #NATO
#Erdogan of #turkey offers to agree on #Finland and #Sweden membership in #NATO only if he is given full control of Northern #Syria ... we are being sold in day light while the west is discussing how much to pay for equity leadership jobs. 
@fshortt @AnonOpsSE @NATO As far as they support marxist #PKK Terrorists and #FETÖ Putschists, they recieve NO from #Turkey! Last week killed turkish #NATO soldiers by swedish ATR4 Antitankrockets burried in #Homeland!

#Turkey gets massive income from Russian tourists. #Russia &amp; Turkey worked out agreement to avoid #BidenSanctions by using credit card transactions in Russian rubles. Mir card replaces Mastercard, Visa, AmEx, etc. which will lose money due to Biden &amp; EU sanctions against Russia. 
🇸🇪🇫🇮 Could someone remind dictator #Erdogan his #Turkey received BILLIONS in US &amp; EU foreign aid that can go elsewhere, and we’d rather have democracies like #Sweden &amp; #Finland in #NATO than Russia-coddling, ISIS-friendly autocracies. 
Now not just the Yellow #Zone, which #KDP controls, is an open area to #MIT to kill its #oppositional persons, but even the Green Zone, which #PUK controls, has been dangerous for the #Kurds from #Turkey.
Do join me 21GMT @AJEnglish. #Finland and #Sweden formally apply to join #NATO - but #Turkey blocks a vote to begin the process. @AlanFisher reporting, analysis with former advisor to NATO @IuliJo. What next for #Libya after latest clashes - @AGomati.
@vonderleyen You should now reduce your "alliance" with islamofascism #Turkey, an ally of #Russia, that's creating all sorts of problems within the #EU , #Nato and beyond. We can!
L.D.:  Sweden makes terrorists talk in parliament; there are even pro-PKK terrorists in the parliament. PKK has an office in Stockholm since 2016. The Swedish government is holding secret talks with terrorists. #Ukrania #Russia #USA #China #Turkey #Finland #Sweden #France
@afrin_mamo @D_abdulkader Some #European countries pay #Russia in roubles in exchange for #Russian oil! Keep your propaganda and hatred for yourself! #Turkey smashed Pkk/Ypg asses in #Afrin and it is now liberated from pkk/ypg terrorism!
@PerLib76 @adamdobraadam @Avrpli_Turkler @jensstoltenberg Both #Sweden and #Finland wants to join #NATO because they afraid of #Russia. #Turkey; on the other hand, became a NATO member by fighting in Korea. That’s all i have to say..
@i24NEWS_EN First get #Turkey out of this organization. They really do not belong to that alliance!

#NATO is expediting the process to include #Finland &amp; #Sweden before Russia attacks them.  #Turkey has blocked the discussion of #Finland talk to NATO.  Map of increasing tensions between Russia, NATO countries. 
#MARKET #NATO #TURKEY   'Stocks had their worst day in more than two years Driving the news: The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,164 points, following disappointing earnings from U.S. retail behemoths Target, Walmart and Lowe's.'
That’s because #Turkey went and bought Russian #S400 systems. And you knew it would trigger sanctions. When you don’t play by the rules, you pay. Plain and simple. If you don’t like @NATO, please leave. You’d be doing everyone a favor. 
What do you call a turkey with facts? Base-ted #Joke #JokeoftheDay #Turkey
#Turkish FM Cavusoglu:  ▪️"I had a very positive meeting with #US Secretary of State Blinken." ▪️"F-16 talks between #Turkey and the US are going well." ▪️"We also talked about #Ukraine. Our work will continue."

L.D.: The terrorist organization PKK collects funds from the USA and the EU; It has a 'strong and accepted' presence in Sweden. #Ukrania #Russia #USA #China #Turkey #Poland #Germany #Finland #Sweden #France
Turkey is the shame of NATO and Islam.  Not the Europeans, not the Arabs, nobody wants Turkey.  #Turkey
So, as we all knew it would happen, #Turkey has (for the time being) blocked hope of Finland &amp; Sweden acceptance into #NATO.  Care to guess which country has second largest military in NATO? Turkey.  Cut to: #TurkeyOutOfNATO #TurkeyIsATerrorState, lol.  #Ukraine #EmpireOfLies
#russia is weaponizing food!!! Time for the world to stop it!!! #china, #india, #turkey, #indonesia, #pakistan, #brazil, #SouthAfrica
