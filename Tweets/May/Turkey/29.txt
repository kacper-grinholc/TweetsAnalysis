@TuranarayanTij @birmahzuruyok @stavrosnavros @NATO @CENTCOM @USEmbassySyria @USConGenErbil @POTUS @AlMonitor PKK has risen out of #Turkey's fascist nationalism &amp; may have been coloured by this. But it has evolved. Give #PKK leaders a chance to join with other #Kurds to negotiate a peace deal. Then the world can see who is what. Killing &amp; displacing innocent civilians solves nothing.
Here is a positive summary of #Erdogan's policies in recent years from an #Egypt-ian perspective, showing very convincingly immediate initiatives on a geopolitical and economic level, openly articulated as part of new perspectives in a multipolar world. || #Turkey

@emeyersson Framing this as solely an issue of #Erdoğan and his @Akparti will not help.  Do not bother at all. Swedes have never genuinely shown understanding about the security concerns of #Turkey and the Turkish people. Good luck as the Socialist West Russian Republic of #Sweden (SWRRS)! 
Sweden resumes export of armoured steel to #Turkey again. The Levant Front is one of the many al-Qaida &amp; other salafi jihadi groups that Turkey supplies with armoured vehicles.  No Swedish steel for Turkey - stop the sales! No protection for Al-Qaida jihadis! @AnnLinde #Turkiet

33 years from the beginning of the forced mass exodus of Ethnic Turks and Muslims from #Bulgaria to #Turkey! It was the culminating point of the criminal assimilation of minorities by Jivkov’s communist regime! Let’s remember! 🤚🏻😞
