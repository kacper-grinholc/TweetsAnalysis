Five wounded as Turkey hit by rockets fired from Syria. *** #Turkey #Syria
Wowww... WE DONT GIVE A FOCK :) With love from #Turkey. We will attend. 
Long story short,my comparisons on 2 wars will be like : #DPR and #LPR will be the #Syrian Republic #Russia same version of itself #azov and other radicals in #Ukraine will be ISIS #USA same version #Poland will be #Turkey  #UK same version And #EU will be screwed imo :D
#Turkey apologized to #Russia and now no1 trusts their foreign policy and opposition inside the country is stronger than ever because of the economical crisis brought by the war in #Syria .Im not saying #Poland will be screwed over by #USA like #Turkey ,but they are lookalikes.
8 months later,there was a coup attempt in #Turkey which destroyed all relations with #USA and leading to a series of events that destroyed #Turkey 's economy and everything.#Turkey find itself in a spot where they had to apologize to #Russia and practically beg for mercy...
Some of u might remember the time #Turkish forces shot down a #Russian fighter jet and tensions were high between #Russia and #Turkey .Turkey was willing to do anything #USA tell them and they were against Russia in everything. #Russians even sanctioned Turkey after the incidents 
#Turkey got 6 mil. refugees in nearly 10 years, #Poland already have more than 3 mil.Only one thing makes #Polish officials comfortable,Poland is in #Shengen area which there are no borders and these are "yellow haired blue eye christian" refugees just like they say in the video. 
“For months there has been speculation that #Turkey would be the first domino to fall, but despite an annual inflation rate of 70% and an unconventional approach to economic management, it is still standing.” @guardian

#Syrian war destroyed everything #Turkey had.Economy,demographics,reliable politics inside&amp;outside the country,everything,just name it.And now another common thing between #Poland and #Turkey is refugees...Turkey ended up with nothing in #Syria and stuck with 6 million refugees 
Every1 in the world knows how dirty #USA fights. You know it from #Yugoslavia , #Iraq , #Syria , #Afghanistan and many others...And u are familiar with the kid brother,the #UK .Both #Turkey and #Poland hyped up by #UK and they both find theirselves deep into war... 
Both countries lost their calm over their thirst for growing bigger,getting lands they lost, #Turkey president was calling BROTHER to #Assad before the war,and #Poland was saying they cant be friends with #Ukraine if they dont admit their genocide back in WW2.All forgotten fast.. 
And most importantly both wars promised new lands to 2 loyal #NATO forces: #Turkey &amp; #Poland  On the left,u see the old lands of #Turkey in #Syria and on the right old lands of #Poland in #Ukraine .Beside of being loyal to #NATO and #USA these 2 countries share something else 
I will try to keep it short and not go all in to the #Syrian war. Long story short #USA used #Turkey as a tool for everything.Used them for their common history in the region,for their common religion in the region.And most importantly promised Turkey a land in the region
I want to start with pointing out the sides of the war in order of activeness,aggression and for proportion of being involved in the conflicts. #Syrian war: #Syria , #Iran , #Russia (since 2015) --&gt;pro #Assad  #NATO led by #USA , #UK , #Turkey , #France --&gt; #Assad must go gang.

#Turkey’s official news agency is claiming the YPG attacked a police station in Karkamis, GaziAntep with a mortar fire and Turkish army responded by attacking northern #Syria. SDF denied involvement. Looks like Erdogan is creating a suitable context to attack Syrian Kurds again. 
Increasingly viewing #Turkey's attacks in northern #Iraq as something the US implicitly supports and possibly exchanged with Ankara for a similar offensive in #Syria.  Is USG hoping Turkey can take out frustration on Iraqi Kurds to protect SDF? Possibly.
