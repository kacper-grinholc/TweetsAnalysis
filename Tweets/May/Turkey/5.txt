According to official Turkish government sources, the inflation rate in #Turkey 🇹🇷 was estimated at 70%, but according to the independent research group ENAG, which tied the inflation rate in Turkey at 142% in March, and this week it reached 156.8%, 👇🏼
And then do you think #Turkiye or #Turks were prepared to accept foreigners and accomodate them into their culture! If no, then shouldn’t #turkish people protest to their govt rather than being racist to foreigners! #pakistanlı #turkiye #turkey #İstanbul #araplar #Pakistanlılar
I believe the Turkish immigration policy creators were really confused! Firstly, why do they need immigrants if they already have a large population with higher rate of unemployment? That’s what has caused #Turks to start hating foreigners #pakistanlı #Syrian #turkish #turkey
#Turkey will recieve a large batch of F-16s  from US because "it is fighting against Russia". That is how you get armed by US, work against #Russia.
