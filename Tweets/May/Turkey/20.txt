#US says #Turkey's approach to #Sweden, #Finland #NATO bid not a bilateral topic   👉 In other words the US is tossing 2/3 of Turkey’s blackmail list   
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has once again shut the door to Sweden and Finland joining NATO, accusing them of supporting “terror organizations.” #Turkey 
This is the new kind of #terrorism.   And, you know how the saying goes - do not negotiate with terrorists.   #Turkey #SwedenNATO   @SweMFA 
@AnnCoulter! Be truthful! The #US, #Norway &amp; #Finland already have #defense #treaty's! #Finland &amp; #Norway joining @Nato commits ALL @NATO nations! If #turkey doesn't like it, KICK their ass OUT,  let them hookup with the FAILING #Russia! My opinion! #tcot #maga 
#Libya should file the same against #Turkey. 
1-'Experts' &amp; 'academics' on #Turkey who were laughing their ass off in the first place continue presenting our original analysis regarding #Erdogan's objection to #Sweden &amp; #Finland's #NATO bids as 'theirs'.  She is also wrong about 'nationalist credentials' given the econ cris. 
Today is the feast day of Zabulon and Susanna, of Cappadocia  #travel #Turkey #history
@niinisto #Finland is amazing.  Instead of making real steps to cease financing, stop providing a shelter and terminate its ideological support for the #Kurdish terrorism, they keep feeding #Turkey with an empty talk.  Please WALK YOUR TALK and then we make a consideration. #vetofinland

Why does #Russia's logistics looks so outdated, for many years I thought #russians were good at engineering. Btw, the best drones are made in #USA #Israel &amp; #Turkey  
NATO applicant arms terrorists - Turkey - Big News   - security #turkey #kurdistan
This is why #turkey should NOT be allowed to be part of Europe, let the boycotting begin! 
#turkey continues to work with terrorist, have they no shame? At least no freedom speech or democracy thats for sure. One dictator supporting another #Erdogan 
#Biden backs #NATO membership for #Sweden and #Finland as #Turkey digs in 
#Turkey's demanded the extradition of Amineh Kakabaveh, radical-left #Kurdish MP, whose single vote enabled @SwedishPM to take office. At this rate @AnnLinde might be next in 🇹🇷's extradition list due to her support for #Rojava. Will #Sweden give up its sovereignty to join #NATO? 
On @VOANews: @ChathamHouse's Jamie Shea previews #Turkey #Finland #NATO talks. @pyatetska with the latest on fighting in #Ukraine. Plus reporting from @6ArmsPowell @ArashArabasadi @HenryRidgwell and more. 
Spoke with @MenekseTK for @ArabNews about the fallout in #Syria amid more complicated relations between #Iran and #Turkey in recent months, and as #Russia shifts resources to #Ukraine. 
Turkey's demand to Sweden: extradite Swedish Member of Parliament Amineh Kakabaveh (governing social democrats of the Swedish PM) to Turkey, citing Kurdish links. Sounds like dictatorial interference in another country's political system. #Turkey #Sweden
@AnonOpsSE Excuse you #Turkey 🙄, what’s in your coffee these days?

Interview: Erdoğan is deserving of mockery not concessions says US scholar, Michael Rubin  @AEIfdp #Turkey #Syria
#Erdogan feels that #Turkey´s legitimate national security interests have not been respected by #NATO &amp; also by #Sweden. His veto threat is coherent but creates the idea Ankara is #Putin´s trojan horse within NATO. My analysis in today´s @expresso  
Does a #bear shit in the woods? #AskingForAFriend #Turkey 
Yup exactly 💯 #Turkey  #Pakistan  #Qatar2022 
#Turkey should pay for #Pakistan or #Qatar to acquire fighter jets which it then leases or stations in Turkey as part of the Pakistan-Turkey or Qatar-Turkey Defence Pacts.  This way Turkey avoids CAATSA sanctions &amp; any NATO disputes relating to the acquisition.

I visited 5 ships today with crew from #Philippines, #India, #Indonesia, #Ukraine, #Turkey, #Bulgaria, #Burma, &amp; #USA. 1 had an ongoing inspection. 2 of the others were not allowed to go ashore. All the visits were somewhat short, but I gave away 4 Bible cd's &amp; an English Bible.
