#Egypt and #Turkey keep their dictatorships afloat through democratic masquerades 
2-#Erdogan has used all options to exploit the national sentiments in #Turkey except the war in #Syria / somewhere else as we explained in our previous tweets. His objection to the #NATO membership of #Sweden  &amp; #Finland  will have NO/very little impact on the #Turkish electorate  
"Telephone diplomacy" with foreign counterparts over Sweden and Finland's bids to join #NATO would continue this weekend, Turkish President Erdogan said. Consent of all 30 existing members is required, but #Turkey has thrown a spanner in the works. Here is why, in 60 seconds: 
@AnonOpsSE What's #Turkey?  Nobody cares about #Erdogan. It's a bazar mentality.  Maybe turkey must pushed out of #NATO because of war crimes and  totalitarian behaviour, not far away from #Putin.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan has once again shut the door to Sweden and Finland joining NATO, accusing them of supporting ‚Äúterror organizations.‚Äù #Turkey 
This is the new kind of #terrorism.   And, you know how the saying goes - do not negotiate with terrorists.   #Turkey #SwedenNATO   @SweMFA 
@AnnCoulter! Be truthful! The #US, #Norway &amp; #Finland already have #defense #treaty's! #Finland &amp; #Norway joining @Nato commits ALL @NATO nations! If #turkey doesn't like it, KICK their ass OUT,  let them hookup with the FAILING #Russia! My opinion! #tcot #maga 
#Libya should file the same against #Turkey. 
1-'Experts' &amp; 'academics' on #Turkey who were laughing their ass off in the first place continue presenting our original analysis regarding #Erdogan's objection to #Sweden &amp; #Finland's #NATO bids as 'theirs'.  She is also wrong about 'nationalist credentials' given the econ cris.

@niinisto #Finland is amazing.  Instead of making real steps to cease financing, stop providing a shelter and terminate its ideological support for the #Kurdish terrorism, they keep feeding #Turkey with an empty talk.  Please WALK YOUR TALK and then we make a consideration. #vetofinland

#turkey continues to work with terrorist, have they no shame? At least no freedom speech or democracy thats for sure. One dictator supporting another #Erdogan

#Turkey's demanded the extradition of Amineh Kakabaveh, radical-left #Kurdish MP, whose single vote enabled @SwedishPM to take office. At this rate @AnnLinde might be next in üáπüá∑'s extradition list due to her support for #Rojava. Will #Sweden give up its sovereignty to join #NATO?

Turkey's demand to Sweden: extradite Swedish Member of Parliament Amineh Kakabaveh¬†(governing social democrats of the Swedish PM) to Turkey, citing Kurdish links. Sounds like dictatorial interference in another country's political system. #Turkey #Sweden

Interview: Erdoƒüan is deserving of mockery not concessions says US scholar, Michael Rubin  @AEIfdp #Turkey #Syria
#Erdogan feels that #Turkey¬¥s legitimate national security interests have not been respected by #NATO &amp; also by #Sweden. His veto threat is coherent but creates the idea Ankara is #Putin¬¥s trojan horse within NATO. My analysis in today¬¥s @expresso  
Does a #bear shit in the woods? #AskingForAFriend #Turkey 
Yup exactly üíØ #Turkey  #Pakistan  #Qatar2022 
#Turkey should pay for #Pakistan or #Qatar to acquire fighter jets which it then leases or stations in Turkey as part of the Pakistan-Turkey or Qatar-Turkey Defence Pacts.  This way Turkey avoids CAATSA sanctions &amp; any NATO disputes relating to the acquisition.

I visited 5 ships today with crew from #Philippines, #India, #Indonesia, #Ukraine, #Turkey, #Bulgaria, #Burma, &amp; #USA. 1 had an ongoing inspection. 2 of the others were not allowed to go ashore. All the visits were somewhat short, but I gave away 4 Bible cd's &amp; an English Bible.
