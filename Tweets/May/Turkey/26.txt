keep #Turkey close. Right now it's more important than the #Kurds (or #Assad): provides an important way out of the sanctions; and functions as a tension producing factor within #NATO. "Great" #Putin thinks, "let them go in, see what happens". Brings TR closer to RU too.  9/11
The #US State Department already said that they oppose an intervention because it would undermine the flight against #ISIS. #Turkey responded immediately by detaining new ISIS leader Abu al-Hassan al-Qurayshi. This reinforces point 4 👆🏼and is an effort to equate ISIS w YPG.  7/11
3. #Turkey will expand its control in #Syria. As I argue, security issues have been utilized in TR foreign policy to advance revisionist objectives as well. Here:  This will also strengthen TR's hand in the negotiations over Syria's future.  5/11
#Turkey to newly captured territories. TR already done so w about 500 thousand of Syrian refugees. This would also relieve some of the pre-election pressure the government faces because of the severe refugee problems in the country. And a main issue exploited by opposition  4/11
