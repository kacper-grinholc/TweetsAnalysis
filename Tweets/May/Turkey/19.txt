@D_abdulkader Kick Turkey out of NATO and bring in Finland &amp; Sweden! #Erdogan #Turkey.
Swedes do not know how it feels to be refused entrance to a club because you are of a "certain nationality". I hope a No from #Turkey to #Sweden in #NATO also will teach them this thing together as one nation, so that they don't have to suffer like we better people, Alone. #svpol

Ask "neutral" #Turkey, maybe Putin will respect their ships.   If Putin bombs Turkish ships, his merchant Navy will be blocked from transit.   Still think the West should do more to lure TR out of Putin's claws.   China not, bc they wld abuse the grain for their own imperialism.
