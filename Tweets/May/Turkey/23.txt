A lot more on #Turkey's revisionism and some on post-Erdogan foreign policy here:   10/10  End of 🧵
#Turkey can and is entitled to a greater power status. It's the representative of the Muslim world and civilization. The West has no right excluding it from the highest levels of the international order. Nor is it allowed to dictate TR foreign policy or national interests.  5/10
not just geopolitical. It's also institutional, it's about status, it's about diplomatic/material gains, it's about setting the agenda, it's about pursuing a different order. In the case of #Turkey - just like eg in the case of #Russia albeit in different terms - it's about  3/10
🧵#Turkey's attitude vis-a-vis #Finland &amp; #Sweden shouldn't be surprising. This isn't just an #Erdogan thing. Nor is it - once again - about "Turkey's legitimate concerns".  Some of us have been trying for years to  1/10  *Screenshot frm this policy brief:  
Finnish-#Turkey talks:"Anything that would jeopardize or put in question our role as a rule of law country or would question our freedom of speech...of political opinion,I think that would be impossible" per @FINambUS   "#Finland is Finland...going to stay Finland no matter what"
#Turkey dreams of far-fetched gas pipeline with #Israel. The plan faces Israeli skepticism over past diplomatic tensions and seems a pipe dream in the eyes of experts due to its logistical complexity and cost.

My @NATO Fantasy: Finland and Sweden's determination to become Members will FORCE Turkey out via Expulsion. How can that not be part of the discussion right now?  Finn Amb: 'You will be able 2 sleep better at night knowing we are there.'  #Sverige: IN #Finlandia: IN #Turkey: OUT

A thread follows 🧵 #Finland &amp; #Turkey have much more in common than we recognize. 1. Sauna. Probably an Turkish invention (steam room) but Finns made it their own. 2. Santa Claus. Again, Turkish first but in today's world Santa Claus lives in Korvatunturi, Finland. 1/n
Here we go again!  😆  #NATO  #Turkey  #Ukraine #Finland   ⤵️⤵️⤵️ 
#ApartheidIsrael  getting ballistic again when you are dealing with IDENTITY CRISIS  #ISIS #SaudiArabia #Bahrain #NATO #Turkey 
@SwedishPM Magdalena Andersson gets public mail from #Turkey's President who accuses her of allowing "terrorists" roam free in #Stockholm. Germany was added to the line of fire by #Erdogan who is apparently bothered by crackdown on his long arm operating in Europe. #SwedenNATO 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he expects his NATO allies to take “concrete steps” to address #Turkey’s security concerns, instead of making “inadequate statements.”  And this same #NATO member does not see #Russia security concerns?
