@E24729324 @GlobalNewsEU @NATO @StateDept @euparl_net #Turkey joined @NATO in 1952 to create a nuclear deterrent to the USSR, and throughout the years we had good relations with Turkey and its military. This all changed with Erdogan's increasingly antidemocratic posture, and why they are not in the EU. We need friends not enemies.
