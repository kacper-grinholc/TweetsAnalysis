#Eurovision2022 - what a hoot! Here's my sixpenny'orth: 1) Wow! UK came 2nd - thank you European friends for at last forgiving us! 2) Merci beaucoup la belle #France pour donner UK 12 points, mwah! 😘🇫🇷 3) Well done Europe for making #Ukraine the winner &amp; pissing off #Putin! 😂🇺🇦 
@emptywheel Pathetic @LeaderMcConnell @politico Trump &amp; @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP withheld aid &amp; military support from #Ukraine years ago- laying the path for Putin! blame @GOP @cnnbrk @BBCBreaking @jamiegangel @Rosie @AP @NBCNewsNow @donlemon
Absolutely, if it wasn’t war in #Ukraine U.K. would have won. It’s indeed about political &amp; sympathy vote competition. Politics shouldn't be involved in this competition. War apologist? Frustrating but well done U.K.🇬🇧 for second is better than last. #Eurovision  #Eurovision2022 
I love "sudden moment of joy" videos...this is a nice one! #Eurovision #Ukraine 
It was a chance for us to send a message to the world that we are the living humans as YOU ARE. But it's always not enough. Not enough to DESERVE YOUR ATTENTION. #Eurovision2022 #Ukraine Sorry,  for bothering you #Europe with our desire to live! I
🔴 #Eurovision Winner's Press Conference #Ukraine 🇺🇦  Before the war begins our song was already Top 5 in the bookmakers. It was so nice to see our song being played everywhere! 
Is anyone surprised that Ukraine won Eurovision?  It wasn't about talent, it was about politics.  Europe is showing how they love Ukraine now when they could give two shits back before the war started.    #Ukraine  #UkraineRussiaWar  #Eurovision  #Eurovision2022  #eurovisiongr
In the east, 12 attacks were repulsed during the day; fighting is taking place at 6 locations | Ukrayinska Pravda   #Ukraine #UkraineRussiaWar #UkraineUnderAttaсk #UkraineWar
Why does it matter that a Ukrainian band won a singing competition? IMO it signals Europe and the free world stands with #Ukraine. The winner holds next year’s competition. #Kyiv #esc2022   #Eurovision   Ukraine will win this war, soon, and be stronger than ever before. 
@lapatina_ Happy birthday to you brave young freedom fighter. Viva #Ukraine  #IStandWithUkraine
@CNN GQP Republicans holding @ZelenskyyUa hostage for photo op. Though THEY VOTED AGAINST aide to #Ukraine and sent their pundits out on TV, radio to attack President Joe Biden for delivering help to #Ukraine.  #YouCantTrustGOP
@DiGada1 @RhonddaBryant #Ukraine gave UK 12 points !  At least #Ukraine loves UK &amp; @borisjohnson even if UK &amp; @borisjohnson HATED by #mediascum &amp; by @BBC cos of #Brexit !!!  Were all @UKLabour at  #KeirStarmerPartygateinDurham @RhonddaBryant ?  #CurrygateforThirty

@McFaul You're right, As no Russian will be Allowed to ,  or could afford to travel abroad. Due to Reparations and No oil and gas income. So he can write the narrative , And the orcs will eat it. #UkraineRussiaWar #ukraine

I promise not to let these winnings go to my head or change me as a person🙏, I've decided to purchase a Freddo and then save the remaining 5p for my future.   Congratulations to Ukraine on winning this year's Eurovision! #Eurovision #Eurovision2022 #Ukraine 
#Ukraine wins #Eurovision and begs the world to #SaveAzovstal.   At the same time air alarms go on in Odesa, because there is a missile attack threat.   Oh, Russians, you need to start accepting our victory. Not only in @Eurovision, you know. 
Congratulations #Ukraine on winning #Eurovision ! I call on all supporters of #Ukraine to keep the pressure on #EU @vonderleyen @EU_Commission and #Hungary @abouthungary to pass the OIL EMBARGO! Help #StopRussia #StandWithUkraine #SlavaUkraine #armUkraineNow

@Eaglewiser007 @euronews well a crazy paranoid little dictator invaded a peaceful neighbor who wasn't even up for consideration by NATO  but now #NATO will be everywhere #Putin looks #Finland #Norway #Sweden #Moldova then #Ukraine and #Belarus I think he really regrets his decision
Well done to #Ukraine in tonight's #Eurovision  and great achievement for #SamRyder  and the #UK entry. Has anyone thought how the winners are supposed to host the contest next year?
@Eurovision Next year #Eurovision will be hosted by free #Ukraine.  Ideas for host location in liberated Ukraine:  #Crimea  #Mariupol  #Donetsk  #Luhansk  #Kherson

@seanhannity I thought your party was all about supporting #Ukraine..what happen to lets get them the aid faster..how many times is republicans going to keep doing things like this
#Ukraine did not deserve this award. An award given purely out of political pressure. Eurovision is over for me. I am aware that there are hundreds of millions of people who think like me.  #Eurovision
I’m so happyyyy for #Ukraine like… I know many people say that it’s a political vote but that what #Eurovision was always about. After all it’s a song contest and if you didn’t like it’s okay. But don’t disrespect them like everyone was made to vote Ukraine.
I’m pleased Ukraine won though I have to admit to being disappointed for @SamRyderMusic tonight.   He was a brilliant Eurovision ambassador and did us proud. Any other year that would have been the winning song. It’s the hope that kills you!! ❤️  #Eurovision  #SamRyder  #Ukraine
@lapatina_ I Did Everything For Ukraine To Win Thank God It Won, I Voted 2 For Ukraine, I wish you good luck People of #Ukraine #Eurovision #Azerbaijan 
@JamesAALongman Amazing song 🎶 but this was always going to be about #Ukraine
So the #UN and #NATO can respond to the #Ukraine invasion now, right? 
🔴 #Eurovision Winner's Press Conference #Ukraine 🇺🇦  We want to thank all the people who support us! The victory is really important for Ukraine. 
Here is the Ukranian commentator crying tears of joy bc of the support they got from Europe.(He had to commentate the competition from a bunker) #Eurovision #Ukraine 
Glad to see the UK public amended the error of the UK judges #ESC2022 Bravo and well done to #Ukraine - excellent performance and well deserved win -  Slava Ukraini ♥️🇺🇦  and a big congratulations to  @SamRyderMusic for a top notch performance 👏👏👏

Dear world, ⠀ Ukraine is very grateful for your support 💙💛 ⠀ See you in peaceful Ukraine next year!￼  #Eurovision2022 #Ukraine 
@HolyDiver73 @RalphTheBanana @Eurovision #Ukraine should win a fashion contest naked, a car race walking and a swimming competition in the desert at the moment. Nothing else matters. Besides, their song was quite nice, creative and entertaining.
So happy for #Ukraine  #Eurovision sending lots of love to Ukrainians love &amp; peace ☮️ 
#SamRyder, bad luck. I really don't understand why we have to show our emotional biases when someone's success depends on our hands. I have full support for #Ukraine but not in this way depriving someone of his hard-fought achievements.   #Eurovision2022 #Eurovision #UK
It could be one of the most unfortunate Eurovision years… And worse than that, whoever is the next victim country wins regardless of the song. We all stand by Ukraine, we all support it, but this contest is a song contest...  #Ukraine #Eurovision
Houses of #Worship in #Odessa #Ukraine are #GoodNewsUkraine #Odessatoday #Odessalife 
I remind you:  The Eurovision Song Contest was founded to bring European countries together in peace, and to prevent further war and bloodshed.  In this spirit, there is no winner more worthy of the title than #Ukraine   #ESC2022 #Eurovision
@eurohoria Where are the dancers showing their arses? #spain 3rd wtf ! I don’t begrudge #Ukraine the win their song was solid but #sweden 4th behind Spain?! Give me a break already
Great respect for the dramatic case of #Ukraine   But the demagogic impulse that enlivened the people's vote in #escita2022 faked the competition.   The Ucrainian song didn't deserve to win.   As usual demagogy is the death of truth.   #ESC2022 #Eurovision  #Eurovision2022
@AmoneyResists You mean “midget” Zelensky. #Ukraine
I literally can’t cope with the selfish #UK nutters begrudging Ukraine the win in #Eurovision  Get over yourselves. They had a great song and deserved the win! #Eurovision2022 #EurovisionSongContest #Ukraine

#Ukraine received 24 points (the maximum amount from both the jury and televoters) from Poland, Moldova, Latvia and Lithuania.  Meanwhile, pro-russian Serbia gave 7 points (all of them coming from televoters), which is the least out of all countries.   #Eurovision

@RuthieeL @EamonnHolmes @GBNEWS @CatharineHoey @danwootton   Anyway if #Ukraine can’t host #Eurovision next year and it comes to the UK then let it be in #Belfast…it would boost the local economy and hopefully help bring people together and showcase the best of the city
#SamRyder #EUROVISION  fancy that UK win the #EurovisionSongContest   well done Sam   Obviously #Ukraine deserve the trophy   but   we know 2nd was always gonna be the winning song 👏👏👏👏
THIS is what I think about the UK getting second place at Eurovision now… 😒 #eurovision #samryder #ukraine #spaceman #uk 
#Ukraine frontline video from trench. 
@KyivIndependent Yep!🇺🇲 We are very involved. Could there be consequences? Yep! Oh well! #Ukraine is worth it! #GloryToTheHeroes  #GloryToUkraine
On behalf of the majority of the #Greek nation, I would like to apologize to all Ukrainians for not getting voted tonight by the Greek #Eurovision committee. Fortunately, we the free people of #Greece voted #Ukraine and screamed a big F*ck Y0u to our putin-committee...
Propaganda wars. Consider: @RandPaul blocks a #US40B subvention for the #Ukraine just before the GOP delegation is to meet @ZelenskyyUa, who is then forced to shake hands with Paul. This will play very well on #Russian TV. Well worth the money eh #Putin? 
@BorisJohnson @Eurovision @SamRyderMusic Are you implying Ukraine wouldn't have won  WITHOUT "the unwavering support" for their fight for freedom?  You do know the UK Jury gave #Ukraine 0 points... don't you?  PS - if UK hosts next year's #Eurovision, will it held in #Rwanda?         and, will UK grant 'musical' asylum? 
So #Eurovision 2023 might be difficult to host in #Ukraine. Hopefully they can, but if not, I’m sure the country that finished 2nd could on their behalf? #UK+#Rain=#Manchester surely? But which arena? @AOArena or @TheCoopLive? What do you reckon @bbceurovision @grahnort? 🇺🇦🇬🇧
@richardosman Apparently @ZelenskyyUa personally gave 12 points to Spain 🇪🇸 and @ChanelTerrero 🍑   What a lad!   #Eurovision #Eurovision2022 #Ukraine #peace
Congratulations to #Ukraine, #ESC2022 winner 🏆!  It wasn't really a victory for the best song, but a political victory... Even so, congratulations! #СлаваУкраїні  #Eurovision #TheSoundOfBeauty 
OK I'm a little bit disappointed about not winning the #Eurovision  I think #SamRyder 🇬🇧 did so well!  If we were going to loose to anyone, I'm glad it was #ukraine ❤️🇺🇦❤️  Can't believe #france 🇫🇷 gave us 12 points!! Nearly fell off my chair!!   #Eurovision2022

While many are blaming Ukraine for winning the Eurovision bc of the war, they don’t understand how much each Ukrainian person appreciates this. Ukraine never usually got attention and seeing Europe stand with them gives so much joy #Eurovision #Ukraine

Dear Poland and Lithuania,   Ukrainians made their clear choice by Televote and we do not agree with our jury’s decisions. We are angry and ashamed &amp; will deal with them soon.   We loved your music❤️  #Eurovision #Eurovision2022 #Poland #Lithuania #Ukraine 
What u guys opinion about Ukraine winning? #KalushOrchestra #Ukraine #Eurovision #Eurovision2022 #chanel #SlavaUkrayini
Why Eurovision is a big deal for Ukrainians - and not only this year (Euractiv, Southern Daily Echo,  ...)  #Ukraine 
Maybe not the best but #Europe shows solidarity with #ukraine and #kalushorchestra wins #eurovision2022 #congrats .@SamRyderMusic  the real winner! 
I just had an argument with my Dad about #politics #Ukraine and #Eurovision2022 This time last year I was in #icu fighting for my life. Best argument ever. Love you, Dad. Don't ever change. Thanks I still love #eurovision
@SecBlinken Please formulate a path for #Ukraine to gain membership into @NATO. After the last #Russian soldier is eliminated, #Ukrainians will need international guaranteed protection and financial support to begin the long process of rebuilding #Ukraine to its full potential… 
@Dee_Tells No shame in losing a public vote to #Ukraine at the min.   #SamRyder did brilliantly 🙌🙌

@Queen_UK Thnak God #Ukraine has enough nuclear plants 😎🇺🇦
This took too long. It smacks of making sure that all their customers were satisfied with alternative supply lines and access to technical help BEFORE they 'withdrew'. Not really helpful to the #Ukraine or the #WarInUkraine2022 
Today the #Ukraine air defense shot down the 201st Russian fighter jet and did it deeply into enemy-controlled airspace. Ukrainians claim that they downed either Su-30, or Su-34. They cost $40-50 mln each. (Photos are illustrative). 
@ItsMalbert @Eurovision Even if Ukraine had not won, the UK would certainly have been in first place.  Sooooo even less. Xx  #Eurovision #ESC2022 #Ukraine
Imo #Ukraine winning Eurovision is a good thing. Whether people think it was deserved or not, the show is bound to repeat soon and if this time it can be used to send out a positive message from people of EU towards people of Ukraine, then it's worth it.
This is what it means   #Ukraine #Eurovision #Eurovision2022 #EUROVISION 
Is there a chance we'll host next year anyway? #Ukraine

@LionelMedia @georgegalloway The vists by @BorisJohnson @TeamPelosi   @JustinTrudeau were PR exercises both to say no negation with #Russia &amp; to keep the war going.

everyday life became different  #Odessa #Ukraine 
India has repeatedly abstained from voting on resolutions condemning Russia for its war in #Ukraine. Is the country's diplomatic neutrality the result of cold, self-serving calculations, or is it preparing to play a defusing role in the current crisis? 
Ukraine war #Ukraine #UkraineRussiaWar #UkraineWar #RussiaUkraineWar #RussianWarCrimes 
@moutet Here's the solution. #Macron offers #Normandy to #Putin as his face-saving way out of the #Ukraine.  With the #Baltic turning into a #Nato lake, it would give Putin  - not the Ukraine steppes - but at least 2 fine ports for his navy: Le Havre and #Honfleur.
For someone who is a "white supremacist" this sounds like the same rhetoric espoused by leftists about #Russia/#Ukraine  "retaliation between the European people &amp; the replacers currently occupying European soil"  Isn't Ukraine part of Eastern Europe?

@MVicary1 Am I wrong, I thought Russian troupes invaded #Ukraine , i.e. Russia started a war against Ukraine ?
NOBODY was going to win against #Ukraine! Not this year! Coming second is like winning! Well done #SamRyder 
Ukraine earned the #ESC2022  victory with creativity and skill. The singer was great, the rapper was great, the arrangement and composition were great, it just worked. It’s not like they were shit and won by sympathy, they won because they earned it.  #Ukraine  #ESC
Congratulations #Ukraine!!! 
@TheShepherdTX @killroy678 There's more #Corruption to hide in #Ukraine than in ShitCago.
100% this. The UK has the infrastructure, plus talented people, to support #Ukraine to host #Eurovision and I think many in the UK would feel it a privilege to be involved. 
@RepMTG @SpeakerPelosi Just Pray! @SpeakerPelosi Matthew will deliver baby food to Americans! #Zelensky needs 💵💵 so does Military Industrial Complex, and Hunter needs a new laptop! #ProxyWar helps oligarchs everywhere! Americans need baby food, #Ukraine needs insulin. Bombs Build Back Better!

They won. Op de dam in Amsterdam. #Ukraine #ESC2022 
Great respect for the dramatic case of #Ukraine   But the demagogic impulse that enlivened the people's vote in #escita2022 faked the competition.   The Ucrainian song didn't deserve to win.   As usual demagogy is the death of truth.  #ESCita  #ESC2022
