Perfectly illustrated in all the COMMENTS to these 2 tw's below; #Ukraine "Talking w/ exhausted soldiers in Bakhmut just back from the frontline."We don't have any new weapons here ..nothing .. I'm expected to fight a tank w my Kalashnikov. We're just cannon fodder. We're fucked"  
"The European Council follows closely the impact of #Russia's war against #Ukraine on neighbouring countries and the Western Balkans".  From #EUCO conclusions on Ukraine:
Two important things: 1) @POTUS has smartly said, that weapons reaching RU territories won’t be given to #Ukraine. Right. As of now. But #MLRSforUkraineNow work with projectile of 45-300 km. 70-100 km range will be fully enough now to overcome RU analogues (max.70 km range) 1/
@lesiavasylenko @POTUS .@lesiavasylenko No it doesn't - and you can reach Russia with ANY weapon. Just a matter of where you place it before you fire it. And their targets are IN #Ukraine duh .@POTUS @EUCouncil  @TheChancellorDE @EmmanuelMacron  @BorisJohnson @cnnbrk @UN
We’re on soft footing to be sure. Uncertainty is very high. Any one factor can tip the trajectory. But, as a whole, a positive outcome is within the sum of possibilities. #Ukraine / #Russia is a problem no one wants, especially the US. We’re like a B+ on that issue.

Address by President of #Ukraine Volodymyr #Zelenskyy to the European Council — Official website of the President of Ukraine: 
@LindseyGrahamSC  How is it possible that #Putin uses thermobaric weapons, fires cruise missiles from the Caspian Sea &amp; submerged submarines, &amp; uses hypersonic missiles, while #Biden kowtows to Putin &amp; denies #Ukraine the MLRS missile system? Is Biden the real Russian agent?

@Reuters Russians will encircle #Ukraine forces; that is the probable outcome. Either that or force retreat. The #Italian, #German, #French, 'leaders' will then REALLY call for a ceasefire, and GIVE #Russia what it wants. The white ants, with their Russian money, and gifts, are in #Europe

@POTUS Very disappointing that you are not giving MLRS systems that are critical to #Ukraine defending themselves from long-range #Russian artillery. #ZequalsGenoide #StandWithUkraine #weak #feckless #NotALeader
Thank you to the countless #Americans who served our country w honor. They have sacrificed for us &amp; others around the world. They helped defeat #fascism in Europe, &amp; esp. with the war in #Ukraine, we are reminded of their tremendous sacrifice &amp; courage. #HappyMemorialDay2022 🇺🇸

Both Abiy Ahmed &amp; Isaias Afwerki have shown the world their true colors by defending Russia’s invasion of #Ukraine. It's time for the world to hold these dictators accountable for #TigrayGenocide. #GenocideAwarenessMonth @NBCNews @TODAYshow @BuzzFeedNews 
Nearly 2,000 children under 5 died from malnutrition in 🇪🇹’s Tigray in the past year. The world’s eyes are NOT on Tigray,but on #Ukraine. Why is #IC ignoring #TigrayGenocide &amp; man-made #TigrayFamine?  @OlafScholz @StateDept @USAmbUN @IntlCrimCourt @EU_Commission @antonioguterres 
@GlasnostGone @ZelenskyyUa We know #Putin has no internet. We think #Putin gets at least 10 times washed info. We know he is surrounded by Yes-sayers. He most likely gets frequent briefings that #Ukraine is about to capitulate, the West is divided, etc Plus we know nothing about his health and mental state
#Intercepted audio reveals a #Russian soldier trying to pull strings to get sent home from the war, #Ukraine alleges  ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
@vonderleyen A huge thanks to all those who worked to make this happen. This comes not at the 11th hour, but at midnight - as Russia is committing genocide in #Ukraine. And past midnight for humanity to address climate change. New clean energy investments can't come soon enough. Solidarity!
