Welcome to NATO #Ukraine! / #RealNews #tcot #tlot #ccot #NATO @NATO 
@ChristopherJM It can be another 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 years from now. How long is #Turkey trying to be in the #EU? It should be a referendum in #Ukraine about #NATO. How about conflict in #Donbass, how about #Crimea? #Russia won't be just watching it. Ukraine is risking serious consequences.
@cspan @ChristopherJM #Zelensky didn't want to hear that. He is upset that #US,  #EU are demanding #Ukraine to get rid off #Corruption which is extremely difficult to achieve, so as reforms. How about a referendum? Ukrainian membership to NATO will have real, serious consequences from #Russia.
Cue the sphere of influence Noam Chomsky Putin loving clowns going into hysterics lmao #Ukraine #NATO 
@ChristopherJM @PoliticoRyan #Zelensky is a populist. He only cares about his own presence and future. He is pushing for joining the #NATO, but it's up to the citizens of #Ukraine to decide such decision. Moreover, he should remember no NATO or US would fight a real war against #Russia.

No. This is just a reiteration of #NATO speak first used in 2008 (Bucharest Summit), repeated ever since. At the time, members could not agree on a MAP for #Ukraine and Georgia but concluded: "We agreed today that these countries will become members of NATO." 
@gjb70 Putin is far weaker than he seems. And #Ukraine has become more militarily effective than it was. It’s not going to happen tomorrow, but we must begin thinking about how, and not if, it will be done.
@ZelenskyyUa @NATO @POTUS said in his press conference that the US is open to having #Ukraine join @NATO but it must first meet the requirements of entry including cleaning up corruption.  Biden does not believe that #Putin ‘s invasion will preclude entry.
Russia’s occupation of #Ukraine, #Georgia &amp; #Moldova does, on the basis of present orthodoxies, act as de facto block on their #NATO accession. That’s understood. But it also presents Russia with a lasting geopolitical victory, sustained by decades of violations of intl law.
Today #NATO confirmed the eventual entry of both #Ukraine and #Georgia into the alliance, supporting their right to "independently determine their future and foreign policy course without outside interference.”  According to @Newsweek, the "outside interference" is not happy. 😏 
@Yamiche @B52Malmet This is a huge F-U to Putin and something of a provocation. If #Russia escalates its war with #Ukraine, NATO would be obliged to respond in kind, with the U.S. leading the charge. #PunishPutin

There’s doubt in my mind #Ukraine should join @NATO but have mixed feelings about today’s optimistic statements by President Zelensky that risk creating unrealistic expectations domestically. Whatever steps ahead have been taken, Ukraine has no Membership Action Plan (MAP).
@cspan Good, #Biden is better than #Obama &amp; Trump (by a million miles) but lecturing about “corruption  in #Ukraine” when the #US just had 4 years of #Trump, #Londongrad washes corrupt oligarch money, #German &amp; #Austrian leaders are bought by #Russia et etc is somewhat hypocritical.

@ANFILOLI @POTUS what concretely it's means to #Ukraine.. they will send US troops for protect under mass invasion from Russia (if it's happens of corse) or just send more Javelins 🤔
That’s not what Zelensky of #Ukraine said and that’s definitely not what #NATO has agreed upon. The details are here (paragraph 69):   
Ahead of Biden-Putin summit, #Ukraine president tells Americans war w/ Russia could be tomorrow in #USA. We’ve been warning of this threat since start of Russo-Ukraine War. Beware. @POTUS @ZelenskyyUa #StopRussianAggression

Evening rain. Dnepr river, #Ukraine   
Partially right. #Ukraine has more to do to qualify for #NATO membership.  But also true that NATO allies are not prepared to go to war with #Russia over Ukraine, which NATO Article 5 would seem to require if Ukraine joined while Russia still occupied Crimea and part of Donbas. 
Applaud #NATO’s support of #Georgia and #Ukraine’s territorial integrity and commitment to their eventual  NATO membership.   They are strong allies and should be part of NATO. 
So #Ukraine will finally become a @NATO member. A good step 
@tarekfad Yeah... 💥💥💥  It was a huge mistake for @ZelenskyyUa  to say this, but I also blame @POTUS for pushing for NATO's "open door" to stay open and stringing #Ukraine along, just because the US can't acknowledge the reality of #Russia's sphere of influence.

Excellent!  What’s next with #Crimea? #Ukraine?  Enough is enough.  This constant #Putin meddling needs to stop.  #NATO needs to take a larger role. 
#Biden says the fact there's an active war with disputed border is not by itself an impediment to #Ukraine joining NATO.  I always assumed you needed indisputed (and so defensible) borders to join the alliance

US journalists misreported another deliberate spin by #Zelensky about #Ukraine joining NATO. He just days ago had to remove his claim that #Biden supported #NATO membership action plan for #Ukraine during their phone call after US officials denied this.  
@ReallyAmerican1 What happens if #Ukraine asks for troops for #Crimea...
#RussiaInvadedUkraine The hot war  in #Ukraine #Europe goes on. From 2014. 
Yesterday, in #Mariupol, #Donetsk region, east #Ukraine, there was a parade to commemorate the 7th anniversary of the city being liberated by Ukraine's armed forces - from #Russia|n proxies.  And yes, that's Azov battalion - it took part in liberation.   
2 #Ukraine servicemen wounded by "unIDd explosive device" in the #Donbas warzone earlier today Jun 14, both hospitalized, one is of medium severity: UA JFO's East Command.
Everyone ready for war with Russia? #Russia #NATOSummit #ukraine #worldwar3
Why can't we just be honest about the obvious fact that NATO expansion isn't going any further eastward?  #NATO #NATOSummit #Ukraine @ZelenskyyUa 
#Russian sabotage before the #GenevaSummit?  #Putin is trying to intimidate @JoeBiden.  I’d say #Ukraine should be admitted in @NATO today.  And they should activate Art.5 right now. 
@Yamiche Oopsie. A bit too fast with this tweet??? #Ukraine #Biden #NATO
@ianbremmer @gzeromedia Is it true that #Ukraine is joining @NATO ??
For those not tracking. #ukraine is already a member of NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP). While not a full fledged member it does mean that they coordinate militarily and diplomatically with NATO. Finland and Sweden are also #PfP #NATO members. #TheMoreYouKnow

@zerohedge Good, #Ukraine will never join. #nato #biden
Breaking News.  #Ukraine 🇺🇦 to join @NATO according to several sources referring to the Ukrainian President themselves.
It’s power🤘🏻🏃🏻#run #Ukraine 
If #Ukraine needs a clear answer from babbling Biden, they'll be waiting a long time.  Zelenskiy to Biden: give us clear 'yes' or 'no' on Ukraine NATO path 
This tweet, Volodymyr, was not a good idea.. #NATO #NATOSummit #Ukraine  
Zelensky trolling Putin? Hard to imagine #Ukraine being admitted to #NATO anytime soon. 
@ZelenskyyUa @NATO Hold on there. “#NATO leaders confirmed that #Ukraine will become a member of the Alliance?”  Um… well, good job making this awkward, but I just heard @POTUS’ speech and, um, not exactly. NATO has Ukraine’s back, but full accession looks like it’s a 50/50 conditional “maybe.”
If true, it could seem that President Biden is reinstating #Ukraine in a buffer State status: 
However, I won't be surprised to find #Ukraine applying to join the EU's #PESCO 
My study suggested that #Ukraine is not likely to become EU or #NATO member in foreseeable future 
2. If #Ukraine army (unable to defeat RU but de facto 5th? strongest in Europe) doesn't fit "#NATO standards", there's obviously something wrong with the NATO standards. Namely, some dirty political interference detrimental to collective security of the member states. #NATOSummit
Now, in the physical #NATO reality: 1. US President has the power to do anything AT ALL to half of #NATO member states, with one phone call. They will vote #Ukraine in (or Germany out, or Planet Venus in) if he so tells. #NATOSummit
US President Joe Biden says #Ukraine's admission to #NATO depends on "whether they meet the criteria" and that Kyiv still needs to "clean up corruption."
On #NATOSummit buzz: No, they will not open to #Ukraine membership.  Pres Biden mentioned 🇺🇦 must meet internal criteria first. Yet, most importantly, the onus of its #NATO accession would be largely on European shoulders. Many 🇪🇺 capitals are still not ready to take the risk.
Ukrainian President claims that #NATO have agreed to accept #Ukraine into the alliance.

Welcome to the team Mr President 🇬🇧 🦾 🇺🇦   #UKR #NATO #Ukraine  
#Biden just confirmed #NATO's long-standing [impotent] stance on the #Ukraine membership: 1. Reiterated that ongoing #Russia invasion does not IN ITSELF preclude UA fr joining. 2. Mentioned that admittance will require "voting of other members US"+"UA work to do". #NATOSummit

@27khv @ruchirsharma_1 #Ukraine didn’t become a member of #NATO. #Zelensky is reiterating something that was agreed to in 2008.
@Yamiche It'll make Putin really mad. Too bad. He should've treated #Ukraine better.
#NATO reiterated its support of Ukraine, and #Ukraine aspirations to become a member of NATO under the Membership Action Plan. There's a long list of things Ukraine must do to be a full member. See Item 69 below.   Zelensky's tweet was aspirational. 
Biden #Ukraine has more reforms ahead before entering the @NATO membership process.  "They have more to do," Biden says, later adding: "We're going to put Ukraine in a position to maintain their physical security."
Now US media misreports Zelensky's wishful thinking about #NATOSummit statement which just affirmed #NATO statement concerning #Ukraine in 2008.

President Biden says #Ukraine needs to meet the requirements to get into #NATO, but in the meantime the US will do all it can to help Kiev "get in position" to qualify for membership.

.@POTUS re #Ukraine perspective / @NATO membership: "depends if they meet the criteria, clean the corruption." Promises to help in terms of defense against Russian aggression.
"It depends on whether they meet the criteria" to get into the action plan "and school's out on that question," replies @POTUS on #Ukraine and @NATO.
#Ukraine - First #Berkut officers jailed for savage dispersal of #Maidan activists  #Euromaidan #справиМайдану   
Last question goes to @SebastianAFP and he asks about #Ukraine getting into @NATO.
@I_Katchanovski #Zelensky of #Ukraine is not happy that he is being told to work on reforms. Zelensky. Since #NATO confirmed plans for a future membership of Ukraine into #NATO, #Russia would certainly built a foreign policy toward protecting own interests. I doubt it would be pretty for Ukraine
FYI - but it looks like this is an important step to #Ukraine becoming a member. 
Some are reading this as a #NATO plan to imminently admit #Ukraine. Not true. To translate it into The Office:   Pam is Ukraine.   Roy is NATO.   Roy confirms to Pam that they are engaged and that a wedding is an integral part of the getting married process. 
I wish #Ukraine would join #NATO.
Waivers on #NordStream2 sanctions.  No #Georgia or #Ukraine as observers to @NATO summit.  Unilateral concessions on nuclear-armed Sea-Launched Cruise Missiles &amp; ground-based nukes in Europe.  No need for #Putin to negotiate, he can just watch the US talk itself into appeasement.

In 2005, #Ukraine announced its intention to join NATO within 5 years.    At the time, Ukraine was reportedly on a fast track to NATO membership.   Zelensky's comments aim to muddy the waters between the US and #Russia, and are unlikely to result in immediate NATO membership.

@ZelenskyyUa @NATO #AngelaMerkel blocked #Ukraine #NATO membership already in 2008.
Tensions are brewing between the US and Ukraine:   1) Zelensky said Biden should have met him before Putin  2) Zelensky expressed disappointment about no US sanctions on #Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline  3) Zelensky now demands clarity on #Ukraine's NATO position.

@artiomboy : #Ukraine will officially join the NATO alliance. Sounds like #Ukraine will no longer be aligned to Russia.  That means #Ukraine will be protected by the alliance against Russian agression.
