US blames #Russia for unpredictability and lack of stability, says #Putin . But US instigated “bloodthirsty coup d’etat” in #Ukraine. 
He said the west was responsible for backing a “bloodthirsty coup d’état” in #Ukraine.
“#Ukraine’s government on Wednesday extended #COVID19 #lockdown measures until Aug. 31, but eased some of the restrictions, Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said.” 
Putin did:  - refer to #Ukraine's Maidan uprising as a coup. - call Biden a killer (sort of)
BRKNG: #Ukraine's official reaction on the purported "#RamanPratasevitch interrogation by Lugansk prosecutors" is SOFT on the #Belarus regime, emphasizes #Russia control over Donbas &amp; Belarus - rather the apparent fact of a gross violation of UA sovereignty by Minsk. 
#Putin goes to deconstruct [an argument disguised as] a question about #Russia's unpredictability - uses cases of #US abandoning treaties, supporting coup in #Ukraine, etc as examples of West's unpredictability.
Today’s #GenevaSumnit will address some of the tests that #Russia has posed towards the Biden admin. In April, @simtack wrote about Putin’s first ‘test’ to the Biden administration, with a large military buildup along the border with #Ukraine.   Read here:
#Putin on #Ukraine: As far as I understand President #Biden, he also believes that the settlement of the situ in Donbas is the implementation of the Minsk accords -the border after the elections, bla bla bla.  UA in NATO: There was a fleeting talk. There is nothing to talk about.

I don't want war against Russia. I dont want us to go to war with anyone. I dont want death. But man...for all his faults, Patton maybe was right, and we should have gone to war with Russia in 1945. So much would have been solved if we had. #Russia #War #Ukraine

#Putin sounds a complimentary note on #Biden's experience as a politician and that he found the talks constructive.  Meanwhile he aired the usual grievances about US "insinuations", #Ukraine disliking the Minsk agreement and reiterating that he says #Navalny is a crook.
#BidenPutinSummit Putin: In rambling response to question on #Ukraine, he repeats past defense of #Russian position and contends, “You should look at what the US is doing, not Russia.”
#BREAKING #Putin accuses #Ukraine of breaking Minsk agreement, says #Russia's military build-up earlier this year was on it's own territory
We made #Netanyahu when we were #military #superpower. Now he is unmade by the people of #Israel.  We made #VladimirPutin too of #Russia. As of this moment, he is being queried by the Press in Biden-Putin talks. #Ukraine #nukes in the 1970s? I was there. I was involved. @CIA @FBI
#putin said he did not hear the question on #Ukraine
Putin's comments on #Ukraine mean the stalemate in peace negotiations will continue. No surprise here. 
Brief published in 1999 by C. J. Dick on #Russia: “Russophone minorities could be stirred up for political purposes and struggles over spheres of influence intensified.” #Ukraine #FSU  
On #Ukraine - if #Kiev ready to fully implement #MinskAgreements we can work together. For now, UKR authorities doing everything opposite to it.  On mil drills - we hold them on our own territory, not on somebody else's. US does mil exercises in other territories near our borders
"#Ukraine must implement the Minsk agreements, Ukrainian constitution has to be amended, if Kiev does so then #Russia has no reasons to be concerned about what's going on there" - President #Putin

🇺🇲🇷🇺⚡ #Putin: 📌There was no hostility, but the meeting was in a principled way 📌The topic of #Ukraine's accession to #NATO was touched upon by a "smear" 📌The largest number of cyberattacks comes from the United States  📌 I agreed with Biden on the return of the ambassadors 
With regards to #Ukraine, we have a commitment to help and facilitate the Minsk agreements, says Putin.
BTW, there has been a significant reduction in ceasefire violations in eastern #Ukraine the run-up to today's #GenevaSummit2021. The OSCE recorded 1,628 between 31 May and 13 June, compared w 4,045 in the previous two-week period.

Volodymyr Zelenskyi believes that the statements of Russian President Vladimir #Putin about "fascism" in #Ukraine, as well as that Ukraine being "part of the Russian world," cannot be taken seriously ☝
#BidenPutinSummit   Putin says that Biden agrees that with respect to #Ukraine the peace process should follow the Minsk 2 track. How @DmytroKuleba  will react will be interesting.   @BenjaminNorton @aaronjmate @scotthortonshow @Antiwarcom
Putin: US &amp; Russian Ambassadors will return to their posts in the future. He said he is not sure if it will be today or tomorrow. The issue of #Ukraine was also raised. #BidenPutinSummit
Putin says Russian and American ambassadors will return to respective capitals, State Deaprtment and @MFA will resume diplomatic services. On #Ukraine - Minsk agreements reiterated, on UKR #NATO membership - we didn't discuss it in details, "there's nothing to disucss here"

The Russian delegation here is obviously larger but interesting to note the presence of Kozak and Lavrentyev as a sign that #Ukraine and #Syria are important aspects for #Russia today.   Also of note is Gerasimov and the absence of a defense/mil counterpart on US side.

A reminder to Vladamir that #Ukraine’s ascension into #NATO is a decision between NATO and Ukraine exclusively.  It would be Putinesque to start that process now and force Russia to respond and further isolate itself from Europe or to lay down and take it.
