Impeachment: New calls for trial witnesses after 'explosive' report into #Ukraine funding  #donaldtrump
@StandWithUs Thank you for bringing this up as your platform has more outreach. I wrote about those incidents last night and today. Sadly, #Zelensky government in #Ukraine doesn't help to fight #Antisemitism. He misled in his interview the readers about lowest level of antisemitism in Ukraine

Your daily reminder that #Ukraine 🇺🇦has been defending Europe 🇪🇺 on its own since 2014, this is the price paid in Ukrainian lives to protect all of us #RussiaInvadedUkraine #RussiaIsATerroristState #PutinIsAKiller 
Former 🇺🇦 Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov confirmed that in April this year #Zelensky had planned to let #Ukraine neo-Nazis attack Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics and that this plan was cancelled following Russia’s military training on its border.

I can understand why our US and Western friends make such panic statements. Those who were following our Arria-Formula today have received abundant facts on US and EU role in 2014 coup in #Ukraine. So keep covering your new “sons of a bitch”, the truth will come out anyway! 
🤡#Zelensky admits that money from #Russia #gas transit is vital for #Ukraine to keep its bloody war against #Donbass going  BTW How does 🇺🇦protect Europe if @ZelenskyyUa asks US and Europe to protect🇺🇦?🤔  #NordStream2  
But what about our #Ukraine bubbles? 
Where is #Russia headed, and has the west changed its approach? Is Russia's relationship with #China in discomfort? Are West-Russian relations at a crossroads? The ongoing #russia-#ukraine frictions point to many answers, writes Gianmarco Bertucci. 
2,206,836 cases of #COVID19 confirmed in #Ukraine as of June 2, 2021 | EMPR 
@ValLisitsa I remember watching that horrific video and #CNN report about it. #Ukraine claimed it was A/C unit exploded or #Lugansk rebels accidently caused that explosion. 7 years passed. Not even one Ukrainian media recalled that horrible attack by Ukraine. Zelensky has other agenda...
Russian Defense Ministry: #NATO supplies Kiev with weapons under the guise of exercises  Under the cover of the #SeaBreeze exercises, #NATO is going to once again deliver modern weapons and ammunition to #Ukraine for subsequent shipment to #Donbass

Enhancing international partnerships is crucial to U.S. national security and bolsters global stability in the face of an increasingly belligerent Russia. Therefore, the U.S. must support #Ukraine in these efforts.
#Ukraine faces several challenges, so it is critical that the U.S. remain a committed partner to encourage work to root out corruption and strengthen democratic institutions so #Ukraine can realize its goal in becoming a member of #NATO and the #EU.
We also stressed the bipartisan promise to support our partners as they work to strengthen their democracy to build a more prosperous future for the people of #Ukraine by pursing democratic reforms.
Today I met with @ZelenskyyUa and other Ukraine officials along with @SenatorShaheen and @ChrisMurphyCT . We reaffirmed that the U.S. stands in solidarity with #Ukraine against Russian aggression and has a right to sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
#Earthquake (#földrengés) M4.2 strikes 58 km SW of #Balaklava (#Ukraine) 31 min ago. More info: 
BRKNG: #Ukraine Cabinet HALVES the proposed 2022 defense expenditures compared to the [bare minimum] limits demanded by a 2020 Presidential Decree, continuing the 2020 trend of underfunding the military amid the war escalation by Russia. That'd be a 💣 if it wasn't for COVID 
@Liberty5380 @DeanoBeano1 Youtube, Twitter, Google, Facebook are massively racist vs Russian+#Russian  perspectives. I'm sure some of the usual lowlives (eg Bill Browder+his Banderite lackeys) have direct "banlines" to Bigtech .Bigtech loves #ukraine #fascists because they have the same evil mentality
@DeanoBeano1 Speaking as someone who's family are from the #Ukraine (Kiev+West of it), those tinpot Nazis+footsoldiers Washington DC's very lowest absolutely make my skin crawl. I sincerely wish #Russia would just send the tanks.  I'd call that junta vermin but that would be unkind to rodents

@senrobportman One of your past tweets, along with a statement by Trump, implied that Ukraine should concede Crimea and the 7% balance of its land occupied by Russia for the sake of peace.  That’s how you stand up for #Ukraine?
As NATO and #Russia continues a dispute over Ukraine’s eastern region of the #Donbas, a Russian military official has said modern weapons will be delivered to #Ukraine under the guise of #NATO’s annual military drill in the strategic Black Sea 
#Biden made it clear, he won't create a diplomatic tensions with #Germany to satisfy #Zelensky desire to scrap #NordStream2. #Ukraine refused to negotiate with #Russia about #gas deals. Each action and nonaction has consequences. Why would Russia care about Ukrainian army budget?
That's hilarious. Instead of going to Fiji, Rory Finnin at 22 was sent to #Ukraine as part of @PeaceCorps. This obviously defined his whole future life. It is hard to emagine @CamUkrainistyka without him. Here's 🥂 to this sudden turn.

In all cases, the sides,traditionally supported by #Russia,yielded to the enemy. Something similar happening in #Ukraine  #Ankara is playing a dangerous game. #Moscow will not be idle when the products of the Turkish military industry increasingly hinder the interests of #RF.

@unian_en #Zelensky is a big manipulator. He is trying to fool western media about real status of #antisemitism in #Ukraine. Many #hatecrime incidents are not reported or being classified by police as "hooliganism". The collection of latest #antisemitic incidents 
It's amazes me how #Trump followers ignored how he conspired with Russia in 2016 to become POTUS, then in July of 2019, with the 2020 election around the corner, he did again, while extorting #Ukraine for personal political gain.  
#Ukraine behaves like a fragile, little boy who can't live without guidance of a role model, a big brother like #USA. I am not talking about ordinary Ukrainians. I am talking about incompetent politicians, diplomats who are currently at the helm of the country. Ridiculous 
Congrats to #Zelensky &amp; his incompetent government and policies. #Lukashenko of #Belarus was neutral in conflict in #Donbass, refused to recognized #Crimea as a part of #Russia. Each action has consequences. #Ukraine imposed sanctions against Belarus &amp; now it's Lukashenko's turn 
#Russia has a full right to have own troops on their territory in any amount from 1 soldier to 1 million even at the border of #Ukraine as long as they are on their territory. #Zelensky foreign and domestic policies are all but failure. 
Today, our @UNDPUkraine #AcceleratorLab team showcased a bold new approach to development --  a whole-of-society approach to combat challenges of open burning in #Ukraine. #CollectiveIntelligence  ➡️  
So basically Zelensky is begging #Russia to keep giving 3 bln € per year to Kiev of gas transit fees in order to kill innocent civilians in #Donbass or to attack Crimea? #Ukraine is a country with no dignity. 
250 #Ukraine #COVID19 units are being converted back to their original non-pulmonary specialty as they're near empty due to [#healthcare bosses SAY] subsiding pandemic. Experts warn there WILL be new wave in autumn unless vaccination is stepped up. Which is, sadly, unlikely.

#Nebenzia: It has been over 7 years now that the #UNSC, among other international fora, is engaged in discussions of the crisis in the East of #Ukraine. But the situation in the present-day Ukraine as a whole also deserves to be considered as it is all too often neglected. 
#Nebenzia: Discussions on #Ukraine when organized by Ukraine or Kiev backers tend to present the armed conflict in #Donbass as the reference point of the beginning of the crisis in Ukraine. They claim that the crisis started in spring of 2014, as if it appeared out of the blue.

Ongoing monitoring of the #Donbass region, #Ukraine during May 2021:  
#Nebenzia: The main message is clear – unless the #Western supporters of Kiev change their position on further encouraging Kiev’s aggression, violence, neo-nazism and unabated nationalism, the conflict in #Ukraine will yet be far from resolution. @mfa_russia

#Nebenzia: The continued militarization of #Ukraine by Western countries, the support of drawing up forces to the Contact Line in #Donbass and #NATO exercises are not bringing the normalization of the situation in Ukraine and in the region any closer. 
"#Zelensky has given up trying to please all the disparate groups that voted for him in 2019. He is now building a new image as a statist, and has reconciled himself to the fact that #Ukraine will have enclaves that reject his policy entirely." 
#Nebenzia: It is also not a secret to anyone in #Ukraine that deadly gun shots made at #Maidan in February 2014 are likely to have come from snipers under the orders of the coup leaders themselves. But the investigation once launched by #Kiev is unsurprisingly making no headway.

Last week, we launched our Cyberdefenders program, a #professionaldevelopment &amp; reintegration program for ATO/JFO veterans in #Ukraine. Participants heard inspiring stories from fellow veterans and received equipment to begin their #cybersecurity training.  
#Nebenzia: Authorities in #Kiev enjoy that same support despite the lack of engagement in the implementation of #MinskAgreements. Kiev seems to be very encouraged by the military support it receives from abroad to help fight its own citizens in the East of the country. #Ukraine
