Now Ukrainians are looked at as idiots for giving them up. Live for today, arm yourself today.   Quit looking at the Budapest memo because no one is bringing the 14000+ dead Ukrainians back.  Stop waiting for the West to defend #Ukraine. Defend yourself always. To the bitter end. 
Ted Galen Carpenter argues that Washington needs to let go of its long-held myth that #Ukraine is a blossoming American-style democracy. In truth, it bears a much greater resemblance to the pseudo-democratic systems of Russia, Hungary, and Turkey.
