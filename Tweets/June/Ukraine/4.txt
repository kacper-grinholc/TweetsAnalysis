To Putin's rep in occupied #Syria:  #بوغدانوف #Bogdanov  - Honor 2254 in (its order) - Release our prisoners  - No more VETOs  - Present an exit plan for #Iran  - Lift your control off Syria.  - Understand that the road to #Ukraine doesn't go through Syria.
In a parallel universe... Some still seem not to be conscious of the major threat that #NordStream2 poses to #Ukraine and #Europe's security as such - or are more likely complicit. #EU's weakness, cowardice and basically unintelligence make Putin unleashed.

In #Ukraine, @UNDP and its partners are studying (social) media posts to understand the ways how false information is leading to ‘vaccine hesitancy’ and to try to dispel some of the myths which are a real threat to public health.  
You see in the map, #Russia separates Crimea from #Ukraine. #Putin is a dangerous and ambitious man. 
Ahead of the #Biden-#Putin summit, @saradzhyan considers what could lead to low-cost, mutually beneficial agreements (scientific cooperation, diplomatic quota reversals), as well as more ambitious topics, like cyber attacks and #Ukraine,  #Syria conflicts.
