@KenRoth And because we don't want to rewrite history, we will remember that the Soviet Union liberated European countries like #Poland  from Nazi Germany, right?

So nations (#Hungary #Norway #Poland ) that flout their treaties with EU member nations, expect EU nations to honour their NATO treaty obligations to defend them should they again be invaded?  I'm not sure that's how it works  There's no "I" in Europe
Nations such as #Norway #Hungary and #Poland which are easily overrun and tend to need liberating really should shut up about their sovereignty whilst shafting the citizens of the nations that liberated them  it's not a good look and next time they need liberating, who'll bother?

"Unlike the crackdown in #Poland which left Jaruzelski in a limbo, the 1989 Tiananmen violence ironically shifted the energies away from pol. change into econ. dev. When Deng made his famous “Southern tour” in 1992, #China was ready to emulate the East Asian “miracle” economies" 
When an individual plans to move abroad to work in another country, he would obviously look at the benefits he would get as a worker.     #poland #polandtoday #polandimmigration #workinpoland #polandjobseekervisa #polandvisa #polandpr #migratetopoland

Ironically, the double standards of our state allows it to condemn #Israel's genocidal regime while simultaneously forging economic ties with their European sympathizer. #Hungary (and #Poland) have literally vetoed #EU's every attempt to sanction Israel over #Palestine dispute.
