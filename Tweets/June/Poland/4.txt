So nations (#Hungary #Norway #Poland ) that flout their treaties with EU member nations, expect EU nations to honour their NATO treaty obligations to defend them should they again be invaded?  I'm not sure that's how it works  There's no "I" in Europe
Nations such as #Norway #Hungary and #Poland which are easily overrun and tend to need liberating really should shut up about their sovereignty whilst shafting the citizens of the nations that liberated them  it's not a good look and next time they need liberating, who'll bother?

Ironically, the double standards of our state allows it to condemn #Israel's genocidal regime while simultaneously forging economic ties with their European sympathizer. #Hungary (and #Poland) have literally vetoed #EU's every attempt to sanction Israel over #Palestine dispute.
