Alistair Clark, #EBRD: The building sector has a significant environmental and social impact, but we look at the decarbonisation of the building sector as an opportunity for more and greener investments  #decarbonization #construction #buildings #Poland 
Alistair Clark: #EBRD aims to become a majority green bank by 2025. Our objective is also to support the countries where we invest in their transitions to low-carbon and Paris Agreement-aligned economies  #decarbonization #construction #buildings #Poland 
Poland is a signatory to the Paris Agreement, which requires that global net greenhouse gas emissions reach zero by 2050. The European Union aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030  #decarbonization #construction #buildings #Poland #EBRD
EBRD: The decarbonisation of buildings requires continuous engagement and the cooperation of many parties and this cooperation is a key task for all stakeholders, the authors conclude  #decarbonization #construction #buildings #Poland #EBRD 
#EBRD: According to the report, titled “How to Decarbonise the Built Environment by 2050: Whole Life Carbon Roadmap for #Poland”, the #buildings sector, including #construction, is responsible for about 38 per cent of the country’s carbon emissions
New study published today by the Polish Green Building Council (PLGBC) in cooperation with the #EBRD outlines how #buildings play a crucial role in #Poland’s effort to meet the 2050 net-zero emissions goal  #decarbonization #construction
