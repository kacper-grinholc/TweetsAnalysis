Not surprised about #Poland and idiots from #Baltic state. I read that #Netherlands is also against such high level talks between EU and Putin of Russia. 
#Poland's persecution of historians &amp; academics, #Holocaust denial, and dispossession of survivors cannot go unanswered by the international community.  This unbridled aggression makes you wonder what they are trying to hide. #HolocaustSurvivorDay 
That’s how hail ball looks like in #Sulejów #Poland. #ClimateCrisis 
Big storms and damages in my #Poland as well, but the scale of devastation after #tornado in #CzechRepublic is something else, simply immense. Courage! 
#Poland’s #education minister said on Wednesday a march held in support of equal rights for #LGBT people was an “insult to public morality.”  
A whirlwind damaged the roofs of at least 40 residential buildings in mostly Librantowa, Southern Poland, Thursday evening. The area's main city, Kraków, has been plagued by severe thunderstorms. #weatheralert #poland #małopolska  
I applaud FM @yairlapid for his proud leadership and standing up for the sanctity of #Holocaust memory.  #Jewish organizations must stand up to #Poland's Holocaust denial, attacks and harassment of academics, and expropriation of Jewish property.

"🇵🇱 #Poland shall never forget you". #Sejm paid tribute to the heroes of the June 1956 #Poznań Uprising.   65 years ago, the first mass protests in communist Poland were held by Poznań workers. The rising formed a corner stone of the later anti-communist outbreaks in our country.
