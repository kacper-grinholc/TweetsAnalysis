@dmcbfs @fiona_ferg Do you #condemn #hamasterrorists firing 4000 rockets, a 1000 killing Gazan families NOT #Israel! @hrw  biased &amp; #antisemitic, what you said is a Web of lies, targeting #Jews, as #Hamas goal is to kill all #Jews on this planet, &amp; #destroy the one #Jewish State! #JewishLivesMatter
New proposed Government in Israel won't last 4 years as planned.  2 reasons:  1) How will Bennett and Shaked work with Labor/Meretz on domestic policy? (Shaked in as Interior Minister).  2) How will Govt survive 1st security crisis with no resignations &amp; Ra'am support?  #Israel
@JoyAnnReid Stick with what you know &gt; You have No Idea Whatsoever what you are talking about &gt; If Palestinians had behaved themselves during the last 73 years instead of aligning themselves w Hamas, the PLO &amp; Islamic Jihad, they would be enjoying a high standard of living today &gt; #Israel
#Israel wants Peace The #Palestinians want Israel, piece by piece It's not a moral dilemma! 
@CrazyNormie @Jtruzmah Yes, but whatever could explain the danger to children in #Gaza? From 2019: The #Hamas coward flees as children are held behind as human shields. #Israel 
Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu is failing and falling as the Prime Minister of Israel. However, the next person (Mr. Naftali Bennett), who is expected to replace Mr. Netanyahu as PM, is equally racial towards Palestinians, if not more.  #Israel #Palestine #UN  
#Israel  #IsraelPalestine  #IsraelUnderFire  #IsraelUnderFire  They shot an unarmed civilian They asked him to beg them to let him go he refused He died of hemorrhage This is Israel 
Both these things can be true about #Israel   1) Anything that gets Netanyahu out of power and on his way to prison is a net good.  2) The next Government is going to be an awkward collection of some seriously unlovely parts hopefully restrained by snap election fatigue.
Let me be clear...  It is not an Israel-Palestinian Conflict.   It IS an ISRAEL-HAMAS/FATAH/MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD/IRAN conflict!  That is all #Israel #IsraelUnderAttack #IsraelUnderFire #JewishPride #JewishLivesMatter

3) Israeli wrongdoing, if any, occurred in the context of a professional military operation carried out in response to #Hamas rocket attacks. Hamas' campaign against #Israel and its civilian population, by contrast, consisted of nothing but #warcrimes, from beginning to end.
(2 of 3)  #Hamas stored rockets, and launched them, in or near civilians or civilian structures, just as it did during the 2014 war with #Israel. This, too, is a violation of the laws of armed conflict.

 Prominent businesses such as @Walmart @CanadianTire @AirCanada @cibc @KPMG some of which are Canadian, are supporting and sponsoring #Israel. Please help us send them a clear message that in this support they are also supporting the apartheid State of 🇮🇱⬇️

Don’t let the door hit you where the good lord split you @netanyahu #ısrael
So much for #Palestinelivesmatter #Israel is doubling down on their far right views. What will US govt do? 
Our top story @trtworld --  Opposition politicians in Israel AGREE on a coalition deal. Israel's longest-serving PM, Benjamin Netanyahu now faces an uncertain future.    We're live in Israel @fthyvz7   &amp; analysis from New York @shaifranklin  Join us 23:00 GMT @TRTWORLD   #Israel
#BenjaminNetanyahu has battled to remain #Israel's Prime Minister in order to escape possible criminal charges related to corruption.  Sounds similar to #Trump.  If that's true, congratulations to the #Israeli citizens and/or residents.  The world is ready for #Democracy 
#Israel opposition #parties agree to form new unity government 
#Science report states that in #Israel the #Pfizer and #BionNTech #Vaccine s linked to rare cases of #Heart inflammation  
Those who claim Israel is an #apartheid state just got shot down. Ra’am the Arab party just signed to be part of the coalition government in Israel #apartheidisreal #Israel #Palestine #Netanyahu #AllLivesMatter #israeli

FINALLY!  #Nuttyahoo given the boot in #Israel as a coalition of sensible people at long last get control of the #Knesset; question remains whether they will install a decent #Human being; like pulling a splinter: 
Today we remember #RachelCorrie 23, the young woman who was deliberately ran over by a bulldozer in #Rafah on 16th March 2003 by the #Israeli forces. #Israel #Palestine 
#Israel has gone from #ZioNazi Benjamin Hitler to Nazionist Naftali Hitler. Apartheid and genocide continues in Occupied #Palestine.  #FreePalestine #BDS #GazaUnderAttack 
#Israel is incredibly diverse. 
The fact that #Israel will have a new government led by @yairlapid/@naftalibennett is not a signal of the public rejecting rightward political and security policies. Rather it is the result of the conservative bloc growing so large it eventually fractured. 
@cailin_bronach @baruch_in @simoncoveney Do you know how ridiculous your Tweet is 😂 and not unsurprisingly not even a propaganda piece to back up your liable.  Have you been to #Israel ?

Listen to Behind he Bastards 2 part on The Netanyahu family for background and context on what is happening in #Israel . @danaelkurd is his guest.
This gives me hope. #Israel can't move forward until they get rid of Netanyahu and his Right-Wing insanity. #Netanyahu #amYisraelChai 
#Lifta should be a #UNESCO site - beautiful ancient village - was #Jewish before it was #Palestinian - part of the enigma of #Israel. 
#PrayForPeace 🙏  #Israel #Palestine... Were watching this #ArabJew coalition very close... 
Israeli Opposition Parties AGREE 2 Coalition 2 Unseat Netanyahu-Israeli opposition parties agree coalition 2 unseat Netanyahu-Right-winger Naftali Bennett could B PM in 10 days unless Bibi chips away razor-thin majority. #Israel    via @MailOnline
.@RamzyBaroud: "The Oslo culture, that of unique but misleading language, factional division, classism and utter political chaos, which persisted for many years, is likely on its way out, too."  #Israel #Palestine
meet the new boss, same as the old boss. #Israel #Netanyahu 
New era in #Israel after 12 years of #Netanyahu rule.  ▪️Yair Lapid, leader of the Yesh Atid party, was tasked with forming a government by President Rivlin after Netanyahu again failed to put together his own coalition, opening the path for Netanyahu's exit. 
"As long as I have any power and control, I won't hand over one centimetre of land of the Land of Israel. Period,"  #NaftaliBennett , a hard-line nationalist,  is now in charge of peace in the Middle East.  He makes #Netanyahu look  liberal.   #Israel  
After 12yrs As PM of #Israel, #Netanyahu will be Oust of Power As Opposition Reached An Agreement to Form Coalition Govt. #NaftaliBennett &amp; #YairLapid will be PM on Rotation. Even Arab Parties will be Part of Govt. The 11days "FIXED FIGHT"  between Netanyahu &amp; #Hamas Failed! 
New coalition Govt to come in power in @Israel ... @netanyahu to step down after serving the country for more than a decade ! Unexpected twists in Israeli politics...  #Israel  #Netanyahu  #NewGov

Mansour Abbas, leader of the United Arab List,agreed to form a govt with #Bennett &amp; #Lapid. It is the 1st time in history that #Arabs joined coalition to form a govt in #Israel headed by #NaftaliBennett who supports illegal settlements &amp; opposes #Palestinian rights,to replace him 
#bycottisrael #Israel is committing a #genocide of the #Palistanian people.   #apartheid #happiness 
History in the making in #Israel tonight.
