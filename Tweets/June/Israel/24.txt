Israel Says up to 50% of Delta-Variant Cases Are in Vaccinated People #Israel #COVID #DeltaVariant #Vaccines

My interview with others in our 3 days protests for #Kashmir &amp; #Palestine (11th-13th June 2021) at #G7Summit #Cornwall. The permanent members of #UN in the summit must solve above disputes not keep a blind eye but sell arms to #Israel &amp; #India to continue!
The #US and #Israel are working together to take on urgent climate issues. This cooperation is just one additional example of US-Israel strategic relations.
