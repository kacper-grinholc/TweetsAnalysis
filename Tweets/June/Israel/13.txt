As far as i know, PM @netanyahu is far better than PM @naftalibennett for #Palestinians. Hope he won't declare war in his two years ! 🙏 #FreePalestine #Israel #Palestine 
So why did other oppositions want to coalition with him to beat Netanyahu? That is not a way to end the Netanyahu era. I don't think they support Bennett's agenda. I prefer Benjamin Netanyahu to continue to be Israel Prime Minister than Bennett. #Israel #Netanyahu #Bennett

So it really does seem Netanyahu has been forced out in #Israel. Normally I would say this is great, coz he's a slimy git who has caused a lot of problems for both Israelis and Palestinians. My only concern is that Bennett may well be much, much worse!!

#Israel makes history. New gov with a majority of 1. First PM to wear a kippa in public. The orthodox deputies are out along with Netanyahou.  Interesting times.
#Netanyahu gone is good news for #Israel as well as #Palestine . Nothing is going to be easy , but difficult is better than impossible which #Netanyahu made sure any kind of peace was while he was in power. #Gaza
Of course he will.  #Netanyahu is selfish and only cares about himself.   He is desperate not to go to jail.  #Israel like #America will be trashed.  #Bibi is #Trump useful idiot.   Neither care about anything. 
Pelosi declares “end of subject” on Omar incendiary comparison of US, Israel to Hamas. @SpeakerPelosi never declared “end of subject” on MTG before ousting her from her committees. The hypocrisy on the part of Pelosi and the Democrats is so glaring.  #israel #IlhanOmar #Pelosi

#apartheidisreal: The separation between #Jews, #Palestinians in #WestBank was part of the agreement between #Israel and Arafat in Oslo. Since then, #palestinians never returned to negotiate the next steps. Israel doesn’t consider the status quo to be the desired situation
