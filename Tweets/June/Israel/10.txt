None of these solutions are impossible, but they would all be difficult to implement for many reasons. The only way to peace is a resounding military defeat of the #Palestinians. This is the only thing #Israel can do, if it ever decides to stop yielding to outside pressure.
The only ways this situation can be resolved is: 1) A military defeat of one side over the other 2) Acceptance of #Israel, followed by the establishment alongside of a #Palestinian State. 3) #Palestinians absorbed as full citizens in other Arab States.
US economic and military support for #Israel commenced to a much smaller extent  in 1948, but greatly increased after 1967 Six-Day war when Israel began occupying West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza. #USmilitary  financing of Israel represents nearly 80% of all aid provided by it.

#Palestinianism has nothing to do with freeing a people, or #HumanRights. The Palestinian cause is to deny freedom and rights to Jews. It involves a blitzkrieg of terrorism and lies that has been ongoing since before #Israel's rebirth in 1948. And it needs to come to an end!

@mookie2068 @MalaikaJabali There's always abuse when there's power. Question is if the country in question has the mechanism to handle that abuse within its own court system. #israel and #us have it. #hamas #taliban #Hizbollah #Isis - I'd like to believe that you'd agree with me that they dont.

Sounds like #MLK was smart enough not to touch the #Israel-#Arab conflict with a 10-foot bargepole. Nuance on this topic just gets you yelled at.  "I'd run into the situation where I'm damned if I say this and damned if I say that no matter what I'd say..."

Rep. #Omar says she wasn't equating US, #Israel and #terrorists - Jun 10 @ 4:55 PM ET 
@RealScottRitter @EvaKBartlett @LaithMarouf Palestine has the right to Resist, it also has the right to reject foreign meddling which has been a deliberate force of division &amp; destabilisation within the Resistance movement. Self determination is a sacrosanct right, invariably violated by #US &amp; #Israel.
