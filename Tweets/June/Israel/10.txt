None of these solutions are impossible, but they would all be difficult to implement for many reasons. The only way to peace is a resounding military defeat of the #Palestinians. This is the only thing #Israel can do, if it ever decides to stop yielding to outside pressure.
The only ways this situation can be resolved is: 1) A military defeat of one side over the other 2) Acceptance of #Israel, followed by the establishment alongside of a #Palestinian State. 3) #Palestinians absorbed as full citizens in other Arab States.
US economic and military support for #Israel commenced to a much smaller extent  in 1948, but greatly increased after 1967 Six-Day war when Israel began occupying West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza. #USmilitary  financing of Israel represents nearly 80% of all aid provided by it.
