@afshinrattansi speaks to journalist #AntonyLoewenstein who discusses how #NaftaliBennett is worse than #Netanyahu, the analysis that 100 out of 120 members of the #Knesset are pro-occupation, #US influence, the double standards re. #Israel‚Äôs nukes + more.

The US gov reiterates over &amp; over again that it gives ‚Äúunwavering support‚Äù to #Israel.  They are clueless that politicians who support a regime with the worst #HumanRights record &amp; #apartheid will gradually be voted out. #Israel #IsraeliApartheid 
@Timesofgaza Maybe Israel will treat them like they sometimes treat illegal settlers with illegal houses: make them move, and then build them splendid new apartment houses/crusader castles. Ha-ha-ha, I jest (mirthless laughter). #BDS #Israel #Apartheid #ApartheidIsrael #Silwan #SheikhJarrah

Palestinians have marched with torches and used laser pointers to protest against a newly-erected, but still illegal; according to International Law, settler outpost in the #WestBank on Thursday.  #Palestine #Israel #ICC #UN #EU
@ErinBanco This is a mistake. Yet another one. Listen to @WHO, look at #Israel reinstating their COVID mitigation measures. We have come so far but I fear we will spiral backwards if @CDCDirector @POTUS do not backtrack. It's ok to say hey, we made a mistake - please, keep #MaskUp üò∑ #Delta
@Lovelistening1 @RightWingWatch Completely agree. Worth noting that this is not limited to #Christianity, that same hatred underlies 9/11, the persecution of #Muslims by #Buddhists and vice versa, the strangling of #Palestine by #Israel. This has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with #evil.
As a strong first half of the year ends this week for the global #economy/#markets, look for  US #jobs report  Eurozone #inflation  Government reactions to the spread of the #DeltaVariant (posting a @bopinion article on what this weekend's #Australia/#Israel developments tell us)
#Naqab village destroyed for 189th time.  This is not in the #WestBank.  This is not in #Gaza.  This is what so called citizenship looks like in #Israel.  It's just slavery.  #FreePalestine

The parent company of Film Festival Flix, MouseTrap Films, is now the distributor of UNREINED, an award-winning documentary film co-produced and co-directed by Marcia Rock and Naomi Guttman-Bass.  #unreined #israel #palestine #documentary 
Why not start #TikkunOlam with your homeland, #Israel? Stop supporting democratic reps who openly call for the destruction of the Jewish state? Censure those who supported #hamas as they rained thousands of rockets down on civilians. Stop using language you don‚Äôt even understand. 
@mehdirhasan Is @SecBlinken the best person to advocate the elimination torture when he is a militant Jew who defends #Israel perpetrators of torture against #Palestinians  and denies support for the victims. @POTUS @washingtonpost

When you travelled to #Gaza via #Israel  Did you report on innocent civilian #Israelis being murdered by palestinian terrorists? 
This stuff looks like fiction, but no, it is #Israel #Democracy. Our leaders think we dnt see nor understand stuff. It's"too complex"they say understanding Israel is a Western proxy and actually there are ways to pursue stability w/o this islamophobia fundemantalist biblical BS.

Just a reminder #Israel is still going full terrorist nazi right now. Still. The entire world seems to collectively chose not to acknowledge the country full of people we saved from being extinct is now trying to wipe out another group of people.
Throughout history, #Israel and the United States have remained steadfast friends. Israel's Foreign Affairs Minister Yair Lapid reiterated this important message following the #Miami disaster: 
"#Dyplomato≈Çki"...  Al Jazeera English: #Israel and #Poland in diplomatic row over #Holocaust property bill.   via @GoogleNews
@jengelmayer @ArielElyseGold @YonahLieberman @IfNotNowOrg @JVP_LA @lsarsour @RashidaTlaib @Ilhan It is not racism to condemn violent jihad.  It is bigotry to prejudge a Muslim as violent. However it is purely out of bigotry and fully about the #Jewish religion for haters of #Israel! Peace and love to all who desire peace!
So #israel saved this "wild card" till now..now it's not just the occupier that is suppressing but also your own blood..shame.. #freepalestine  #FreePalestine
