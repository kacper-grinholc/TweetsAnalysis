@lindebr @TheChasamSofa @Starkillerdude1 @Palestine_UN @UN Agreed but sadly many armchair activists will again only grab hold of half the stories, and negating anything that challenges their already pro-#Israel or pro-#Palestinian bias without actually reading the Geneva Convention and the Law of Armed Conflict.
