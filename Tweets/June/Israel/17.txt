Tensions between #Israel and terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip have risen in the last three days, following a threat from #Hamas to escalate attacks in response to the Jerusalem Flag March on Tuesday. 
#GAZA #ISRAEL (June18 2021) Red alert in southern Israel. Israel strikes Gaza for the second night in a row, after explosive balloons haven been launched from Gaza into Israel.
Why are you still silent? Why did you forget Palestine? People are dying ! Don't you have any pity?! My heart can hardly stand... #GazaUnderAttack #Palestina #FreePalestine #SavePalestine #Gazze #Filistin #PalestinianLivesMatter #غزة_تحت_القصف #فلسطين #IsraeliTerrorism #ısrael 
Liar!  Israel struck the military sites of incendiary devices - total provocation by HAMAS. You can lie all you want - the world knows the truth #ISRAEL 
#Israel-#Hamas clashes resume for second day: Sirens sound in #Israel's south after IDF strikes #Gaza targets for second night in a row
There always seems to be a flareup with #Gaza whenever #Israel's @IDF chief of staff Aviv Kochavi is scheduled to depart for the United States. 
Another boring statement by Hamas : “The resistance will not allow that the enemy will impose new equations regarding the fighting in #Gaza “  #Israel 
For the second night #israel is attacking #gaza, stop #IsraeliTerrorism !! #IsraelTerorrists #IsraelCrimes #Palestina #GazaUnderAttack #SavePalestine #SaveGaza #SaveSheikhJarrah #SaveSilwan #IsraelApartheidstate #IsraelExposed #WarCrime #HospitalPlaylist2 #uaeu #BREAKING
#Israel has launched airstrikes on the #Gaza Strip for a second time since a shaky ceasefire ended last month's 11-day war.  The strikes came after activists mobilized by the territory's militant #Hamas rulers launched incendiary balloons into Israel for a third straight day. 
#Israel murdering kids, support #BDS 
Rockets hitting #Israel right now  God help us.
its interesting to note that retaliating to an armed assault is considered breaking peace treaty.  If Hamas 'did' launch the incendiary balloons as reported, then well its a simple case of getting crushed by an elephant when you prick it with a needle. #Israel #Palestine #Hamas
