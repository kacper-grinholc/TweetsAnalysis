@keller_lind #Palestinians go to Israeli hospitals because they are treated for free, despite being non-citizens and uninsured. Yet thet are denied care in hospitals in Arab states surrounding #Israel, again because they have no insurance, and are denied citizenship.
A 3rd grader could intuit the obvious logic here, which also obviously applies to #Israel:   Criticism of Israeli politicians and government policy does NOT an anti-Semite make.

Enjoyed working with @DavidADaoud on a new piece for @UANI. We look the recent escalation between Gaza and #Israel and how the Israeli-#Iranian shadow war has entered a new “tit-for-tat” phase – at least at sea. #oott 
The demise of #BenjaminNetanyahu as #Israel PM might be amusing, and long overdue, but it will not even begin to make life better for the #Palestinians.  #Knesset #IsraeliElection #ByeByeBibi #Zionism #Palestine #NaftaliBennett #PalestinianLivesMatter 
One of #Israel occupation crimes in palestine..  everykid die in palestine your supporting is the reason.Stop anti anyone support this terrorist occupation.Palestine need  to hear your voice 🚫 #SaveSheikhJarrah #SaveSilwan #StopFundingIsrael #Palestine 
Thank you to the group of 55 bipartisan Members of Congress who have stood up to support #Israel’s life-saving Iron Dome! Fully funding our security assistance to our ally is more important now than ever!
With @naftalibennett as prime minister and @AvigdorLiberman as finance minister, #Israel's economic policy is likely to shift. 
While SBS and ABC reporters cont to be pressured to whitewash Israeli crimes I sat on this incredible panel: Palestine and the Media with @antloewenstein and @sababebawi to explain it all. Recording: Palestine and the media,    #Palestine #israel #media
Wrote on Israel-Palestine Conflict and Explained the entire series of events from the end of 19th-Century in this 2500+ words long Academic Issue Brief for Center of Policy Research and Governance, Delhi. Looking forward to engagement and critique  #Israel 
MUST WATCH! Who's Really Responsible for the Bloodshed in the Middle East? Dr. Waseem Yousef, one of the most prominent public intellectuals in the #UAE, tells his Muslim brethren who is truly responsible for all the bloodshed in the Middle East. Hint: #Israel? Nope! 
Arab presence in likely new #Israel government hailed as historic. 
An Apartheid Colonial state founded on Dispossession, Annexation, Military Occupation and Systemic Oppression  #Israel @IntlCrimCourt @UNHumanRights @EUinIsrael

#ısrael This is how they raise their children, violence is part of their daily life

.#TedCruz campaign defended pastor who said God will send 'hunters' to kill Jews - Jewish World - @Haaretz | #Israel news, #COVID vaccine data, the Middle East and the @Jewish_World @Haaretz  #FuckCruz! @SongShul @SenateDems @JNFUSA @Hasbarafellows @NPR
@RealHarland @Remroum Blah blah. Just keep deluding yourself with that old and tired #Zionist talking point. Those pesty Arabs came to #Israel after the Zionists made the desert bloom and decided to stay and live in #ApartheidIsrael because they like being abused and their children killed.
Yesterday I was on @cgtnamerica TV's "The Heat" with an illustrious panel of guests talking about the end of the #Netanyahu era (fingers crossed) and a new 'change' government in #Israel.  Check it out!: 
Does anti-Israel media bias such as the @nytimes' egregious, error-filled incitement last week really matter? I explain in @JNS_org that the recent surge #Antisemitic attacks show this issue is no longer merely a matter of defending #Israel's reputation. 
Dr Waseem Yousef thank you for setting things straight #israel #Palestine #ApartheidIsrael  #FreePalestine #FreeGaza #FreeGazaFromHamas           
This is what's happening if you #Boycott #israel. They don't know how to deal with #rejections. #freepalastine #GazaUnderAttack #ApartheidIsrael

#bbcnews - #PM #Netanyahu calls to block #Israel's newly formed coalition - disgusting to see #jews aligning with #muslims who support #Palestine, for the sake of power
In the recent war between #Israel and Hamas, a cease-fire was achieved after days of fighting. For Israel, a key to its success has been the #IronDome air defense system.  Read more here:  
#BenjaminNetanyahu calls to block #Israel's newly formed coalition 
#Malaysia blocked earlier this year all relations with #Israel and as a result, #israel send a #bullycountry #plane in #Malaysian #airspace. Now I know #Israel is a #bullycountry that can't accept someone else #Opinion. #israelgetalife 
Palestinians call for a massive march on Friday toward the settlement outpost built on Sbaih hills southern Nablus in West Bank? #Israel is trying to expand in that area and build more illegal settlements on stolen lands, but Palestinians will defend their properties  #Palestine 
After #Netanyahu it looks like #Israel is getting a new PM - but what is #Zionism, the philosophy that underpins the #Jewish state?  @DovWaxman explains the history - and doesn't duck the tough questions @BylineTimesPod @GoldbergRadio @BylineTimes
