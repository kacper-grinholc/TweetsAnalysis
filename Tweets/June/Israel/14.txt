Vile headline showing again #BBCNews is far right pro Tory propagandist &amp; lost all credibility as a trusted impartial news source &amp; also constantly ignores the daily war crimes rained in Palestine by apartheid #Israel. 
President @LBpresidency  has told an American mediator of the Lebanese-Israeli #maritime #border negotiations that he wants the talks to resume. The talks reportedly stalled in May after #Lebanon rejected preconditions set by the mediator #Israel

It‚Äôs more critical now than ever that Israel be able to defend itself, by itself. We‚Äôre thanking the HUNDREDS of Members of Congress who have shown their support for our ally #Israel &gt;&gt; 
The¬†entire IDU family thanks¬†@netanyahu for his commitment and engagement in the global alliance of centre-right parties and for his strong leadership as Prime Minister of #Israel. 
The ugly anti-American hate of anti-Israel activists.  It is important that we fight for the truth wherever it is under attack, because the enemies of #Israel today will be the enemies of the United States tomorrow.  My column in @Jerusalem_Post today:
