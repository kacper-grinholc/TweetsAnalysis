@Kathygannon @hidhussain @AP What you expect when not a single terrorist was Afghan. Osama was a freedom fighter when fighting Russian and then became  terrorist when #USA failed post withdrawal of Russia. USA doesn't care about #Afghans or #Muslims for that matter &amp; only cares about #Israel.
The Non-Inclusion of #Israel on the List of Children's Rights Violators is Disgraceful  Full statement here:   (1/9) . #SaveSheikhJarrah 
American Jews have no alliegance to the State of Israel.  It’s an antisemitic idea to view Jews as a separate nationality within their home country.  #Israel is not our nationstate.  Their leaders are not our reps.  And conflating Jews with Israel definitely causes Antisemitism! 
#BREAKING Media reports that #Iran's only operating #NuclearPlant #BESHEHR is shut down 4 "emergence reasons" &amp; the shutdown could last three to four days. This comes as #Israel's new PM Naftali Bennett condemns Raisi victory saying it must serve as wake up call for global powers
What would happen if this was in America what do you think the American reaction would be #freepalastine #SaveSheikhJarrah #Israel #SaveSheikhJarrah #saveselwan #savejaffa #SaveAlAqsa #Gaza #IsraelTerrorist  #GazzaUnderAttack #IsraeliTerrorism #IsraeliApartheid #SaveBeita 
@wainaabdul @StandWithUs @naftalibennett @yairlapid No need another country w/no human/women rights, #LGBTQ is Haram, no need another Syria, Iraq... Jewish #Israel is there to stay, get used to it....
#Nasrallah's letter to President-elect #EbrahimRaisi is dated Sunday, June 20, 2021.  #Hezbollah #Iran #Iraq #Israel #Lebanon 
The pfizer vaccines transferred by #Israel may be about to expire, ONLY if they are unused.  Once injected, their impact will be the same as new vaccines. Its a stupid decision by the PLO to reject them. If I had it my way, I would immediately ship them all to #Iran. 
Famiglia: Farah persecute friends of #Israel. Do I have to say more? 😉 
@DrEricDing I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS. My 14 yr old son just went into to quarantine because of classmate with delta variant. #ffs #Israel #covid19
Government appoints 36 diplomats, a move held up by Netanyahu for over 6 months  #Israel @netanyahu 
The #Hezbollah S-G's letter also makes it clear that #Iran's Pres.-elect #Raisi is viewed as serving "in the shadow" of "Imam Leader Sayyed #Khamenei."  The letter also takes a jab at USA, #Israel &amp; #Saudi by alluding to "occupiers, invaders, aggressors &amp; the imperious". #Lebanon 
Over 180 Israeli intellectuals, scientists warn International Criminal Court: Don't rely on #Israel to probe #WarCrimes. @IntlCrimCourt  
📺🇬🇧👁‍🗨 #Israel is Jesus's promised return place The LAND is the significance &amp; why it must not be destroyed =#Biblical #prophecy  Cabal=snakenists They must kill #Trump to fulfill evil takeover to prevent #Jesus ultimate return Watch #Queen of Evil #G7  👈
@AmichaiStein1 Of course most of the executed were MEK #terrorists on #Saudi &amp; #Israel payroll so I’m sure Bennet is pissed at that fact
@DrHananAshrawi #Israel's blueprint for ethnic cleansing. Plan Dalet '48: "Destruction of villages (setting fire to, blowing up, and planting mines and debris), especially those population centers difficult to control continuously... the population must be expelled outside borders of the state."

When you leave out half the story, it's much easier to demonize #Israel.  Share the truth. Stand with Israel.  📷 @elderofziyon 
Come on! Damn it #America! #WTF! You talk abt child trafficking &amp; child abuse &amp; go nuts if a child is killed because an adult ahole is waving a gun! But come on! #IsraeliTerrorism is done because #Israel KNOWS there is no consequences! #FreePalestine
Those who made a meeting today in #Haifa for #Azerbaijan against #Armenia , using fake #Unesco recording. #Israel has nothing to do in relations of #Azerbaijan and #Armenia. You became part of #Turkey that created #ArmenianGenocide .
Following demonstrations against #Israel: Will #Germany #outlaw #Hamas flag? According to daily 'De Volt' news coalition member parties agreed to promote clause in the criminal law to ban the dissemination of #propaganda to organizations on the list of #EU #terror organizations. 
I shared this vid in response to another thread, but I urge everyone to watch it. Miko's grandfather was one of original founders of #Israel. His dad was major general in 1967 war.  If you can't watch it all, watch from ~1:18:00 onwards. 
#Israel, the Living God cannot forgive you when you spray sewage on His places of worship, NO.
@jiminsliIies #Palestine needs your support.  KEEP TALKING about #ISRAEL CRIMES.  #IsraeliTerrorists have occupied #Palestine ILLEGALLY.  #Israel has NO rights to stand OUTSIDE the 1948 border, per UN.  #BDS #BoycottIsrael #BoycottIsraeliProducts  #BlockTheBoat #EndIsraeliTerror #ShutElbitDown
This is #Israel. #FreePalestine from #ApartheidIsrael 
Yair Lapid has pursued a remarkably consistent political project throughout the past decade, one which has come into fruition with the formation of #Israel's new government, @MarkMellman tells @calev_i24: 
Sayyed Hassan #Nasrallah's congratulatory letter also puts to rest another important matter:  President-elect #EbrahimRaisi is indeed an #Ayatollah, as the #Hezbollah S-G addressed him as such.  #Iran #Iraq #Israel #Lebanon 
Good luck @ItaiBardov! #Panama 🇵🇦🤝🇮🇱 #Israel
