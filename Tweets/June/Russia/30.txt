@VeraVanHorne The biggest problem that misinformation in #Russia is huge about #covid19 and #COVIDVaccines. However, even Russian TV doctors have been misleading the viewers about vaccines. Now as #DeltaVariant is hitting young and old in Russia, maybe people will wake up &amp; get vaccinated
@VeraVanHorne I disagree with Putin on #COVIDVaccines. He finally admitted he got #SputnikV. It's know that SputnikV in #Russia is the only vaccine that gives immunity against #DeltaVariant. Low vaccination campaign is also his responsibility, but also Russian TV doctors that gave wrong info

@27khv In my view, #Putin, local tv in #Russia did poorly to motivate ordinary Russians to sign up for jabs. TV doctors in Russia were spreading info how #covid was just a new flu, common cold and how healthy adults won't need vaccination except elderly. Now we see an outcome.
@27khv I don't like what #Putin of #Russia have said about #COVID19Vaccine. US medical journal #lancet had positive review of #Sputnik. There is no vaccine that protects anyone 100%. In such #pandemic, it's not good to discredit vaccines including #Pfizer or Russian made one.
