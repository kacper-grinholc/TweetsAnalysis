#Russia has released videos of the incident with the British destroyer as it crosses through Crimean waters. They show Russian jets following the warship but there don‚Äôt seem to be any warning shots or bombs being dropped in these videos.

#BorisJohnson @BorisJohnson I think we should try to get on better with #Russia, on who's side we fought in World Wars, &amp; against #Napoleon. I'd inadvertently made a gun sign at #Berezovsky, shortly before #Litvinenko died. Past 20 years, #Russia's behaviour better than ours?

I don't believe the Russians. They excel at disinformation and misinformation. You only believe the boy crying wolf a couple of times before dismissing him as a liar.  #Russia says it chases British destroyer out of Crimea waters with warning shots, bombs

The West (@NATO) must end its policy of fruitless threats and appeasement with #Russia. The only way to counter #Putin's extravagance is to retaliate. #Putin only understands the language of force, so it is time to confront him. 
"Terrorists cyberattacks can lead to interstate conflicts, FSB Director" says in #Russia &amp; asks to bring that to #UN - did FSB just called Russian GRU (mil. intel) who run hackers that often attack #USA "terrorists" Plausible deniability a la FSB?
