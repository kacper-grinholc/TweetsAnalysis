#Russia said it chased a British destroyer out of #Crimea waters with warning shots and bombs in its path, but Britain rejected Russia's account of the incident  Vía @Reuters  
#Russia has released videos of the incident with the British destroyer as it crosses through Crimean waters. They show Russian jets following the warship but there don’t seem to be any warning shots or bombs being dropped in these videos.

Conservative US thinking on #Turkey seems to be divided between those who think Turkey is now an ally of #Russia and those who think it is going to join an anti-Russian/anti-#Iran alliance.  They are both wrong and fundamentally misread Turkey's own strategic vision.

@UN @USAmbUN @SirMarkLowcock To underline the malign intent behind #Russia's approach, @RussiaUN's Nebenzya told the UNSC today that:  - Cross-line *is* a superior replacement for cross-border (absurd &amp; lacking any evidence)  - Closing al-Yaroubiya in the NE led to increased aid provision (completely false).

@UN @USAmbUN The @UN has facilitated months of negotiations in #Damascus to secure x1 "test" cross-line convoy to Atareb in #Idlib -- but #Assad's regime (backed by #Russia) has blocked any possible agreement at every single step.  As @SirMarkLowcock said, "not a single truck" has gone.

I don't believe the Russians. They excel at disinformation and misinformation. You only believe the boy crying wolf a couple of times before dismissing him as a liar.  #Russia says it chases British destroyer out of Crimea waters with warning shots, bombs 
Aaron N. Ratz is a rising second year MSFS student concentrating in Global Politics and Security with a focus on #EasternEurope and #Russia. As a part of the @StateDept's Pathways Program, he is preparing to work at the US Embassy in Uzbekistan this summer! (1/2)  #MSFSPride 
 US intelligence operatives had been tracking Saab’s flights to #Venezuela, #Germany, #Russia, #Italy and #Iran. Those visits could be covered by CLAP program, i.e illegal #gold and #drugs activities.

Along with #Putin’s “President” title comes a sort of protection. When this goes, he will try &amp; hide but the charges &amp; trails will come. He will lose his fortune. That’s why he’s doing everything to stay in power. #freeNavalny #Russia #MagnitskySanctions 
I noticed this shell on Scylla's neck back in season 1. What if this shell is from the very beach on which Scylla spent a week as a child? Time of theories #MotherlandFortSalem  #MotherlandFortSalemRussia  #Russia @Amaliajaja @taylorhickson @JessLauraSutton @ashleynicwill

Putin and his ‘friends’ must be so terrified for for the ideas of the Russian people that they lock up ‘everybody’ and even close down an organisation like Bard College. #Russia  #Bardcollege 
@SkyNews #Russia haven’t got any defenses you could put a hole through there armory with one finger they are rusty and 30 year old
The West (@NATO) must end its policy of fruitless threats and appeasement with #Russia. The only way to counter #Putin's extravagance is to retaliate. #Putin only understands the language of force, so it is time to confront him. 
"Terrorists cyberattacks can lead to interstate conflicts, FSB Director" says in #Russia &amp; asks to bring that to #UN - did FSB just called Russian GRU (mil. intel) who run hackers that often attack #USA "terrorists" Plausible deniability a la FSB?

Hmmm….Sounds like something #Authoritarian leaders like,  #Putin- #Russia, #KimJongUn-NKorea&amp; leader of #CommunistPartyOfChina -would do.  Where DOES #RonDeSantis GET SUCH RADICALIZED ideas?  Because they have nothing to do w America, #FreeSpeech  or how a Free country operates. 
London’s recent naval deal with Kyiv will add to Russia’s concerns #Ukraine #UK #Russia 
@SecDef @NilsMelzer , Are you trying to say that #Russia has SUPERIOR #NSAAirForceDronesAIInformationWarfare #DARPAInternet over #US? A show for #GeoPoliticalsCounterParts #WorldStage ... This is a complete and total lie. You have #RusdianSoldiers with others on #USSoil.
