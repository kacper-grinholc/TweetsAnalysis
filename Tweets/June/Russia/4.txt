Vladimir Putin has ruled #Russia for 21 years, 260 days.
#Putin said that #Russia‚Äôs #NordStream2 gas pipeline is ready to start pumping gas to #Germany and the final stretch will be completed within two months. Less than 100 kms are left to complete the project as #US #Biden seeks good relations with ‚Äúkey partners in Europe,‚Äù
@BernieSanders and how many other #Democrats think #Communism is OK? #Russia 
A big setback for #Poland &amp; victory for #Russia: #Denmark has withdrawn permission for a planned pipeline that was designed to bring #Norwegian gas to Poland, citing the need to assess if the project would harm the habitats of certain mice and bat species.

Excellent thread and article by two awesome #China-#Russia experts @AlexGabuev @LeonidKovachich on why #China-#Russia mirroring of #information tactics does not necessarily mean joint information warfare. 
I can't imagine wanting to go to #Russia! Not with the government they have! 
They may not want to call it what it is, but we're in a Cold War with #Russia and it's satellites. And THEY are going beyond it with their GD cyberattacks. I see no benefit to a summit with #Putin. He just wants to whine about "holding #Russia back." HE'S responsible for THAT! 
We spend over $80 billion/year on Intel. If #China or #Russia have created planes/drones that act like UFOs &amp; we don‚Äôt know it- major embarrassment @AshWebsterFBN
How to know if #UFO's are advanced technology of #China, #Russia, etc.? An obvious and unobtrusive test: Have other nations seen the UFO's? Surely #Americasspyorganization does more than attack #Republicans? If China/Russia have not seen UFO's, then they have the technology.

06/04/21 #CyberSecurity #Russia @DOD @thejointstaff @US_CYBERCOM @CISAgov: FBI attributed the JBS attack to Russia-based hacking groups REvil and Sokinokibi, and the Colonial Pipeline breach to Eastern Europe-based criminal organization, DarkSide. US cyber security...(1/6)

So hackers knocked out a couple of TV stations. I can't say that I'm upset about that. In fact, I'm kind of laughingü§£  I wish they'd take out CNN, MSNBC and FOX. Make them pay billions in ransom to be able to broadcast their garbage.   #hacked #russia #media #tv
