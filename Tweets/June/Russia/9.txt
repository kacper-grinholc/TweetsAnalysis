They first took banks, then energy, etc. So? 0% chance we're not at war.
U.S. urges #Russia to cease the abuse of “extremism” designations to target nonviolent organizations, end its repression of #Navalny and his supporters, and honor its international obligations to respect and ensure human rights and fundamental freedoms…  👇👇 
@jarjasko @TarikCyrilAmar #RT doesn’t allow anything contrary to #Kremlin policy to be published and Tarik knows this. By writing in RT does that mean he agrees with Kremlin policies regarding #Ukraine? Yet to see anything from him denouncing the #occupation of #Ukrainian #territory by #Russia.
America needn’t shouldn’t and actually isn’t fighting #Russia. It’s fighting the kleptocratic sham-democratic thugs who control Russia, &amp; the kleptocratic sham-democratic weasels in the #GOP, but unfortunately half the voters have been coopted to shout for #Trump and #Putin. Sad. 
@GlenGrant Normal countries call it defence spending. In #Russia ‘s case it is military aggression spending. This is what #Putin does instead of investing in the Russian people &amp; their future.
Oppose Putin = you’re a criminal. Why pretend to have elections at all? #Dictatorship #Putin #russia #navalny
In #Russia, Moscow city court designated the Anti-Corruption Foundation @fbkinfo and the network of regional offices of the imprisoned opposition politician @Navalny as 'extremist organisations': 
#China and #Russia won't institute the G7 proposed global min tax rate. This encourages companies to leave the US and go to low-tax, pro-business nations. @POTUS's solution to everything is raise taxes when we should be encouraging businesses to flourish.
