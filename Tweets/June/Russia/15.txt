#Turkey is pushing #Russia out of the south, so maybe it's time to discard the principles of "tomato diplomacy", think about security, and make dramatic personnel changes, including in the country's main foreign policy department
Azerbaijan is becoming an integral part of Turkey, a NATO member state, an alliance known for its hostility towards our country. Turkey is finally consolidating itself in the South Caucasus, gradually ousting #Russia, in addition, the frankness of the Turkish leadership,
Integrity? @JoeBiden @POTUS selling weapons to, and supporting #SaudiArabia and #Israel while criticizing #China and #Russia. Funny view of the definition of integrity. Maybe you meant #Hypocrisy ? 
@JoeBiden @POTUS Get a just settlement in #Palestine, #Yemen that the whole of the #ME can support - think where that puts #China and #Russia and #Iran? You would win there too. World peace, world justice, all you have to do is to be impartial to world injustice? You big enough?

It serves no purpose to "double down" on sanctions against an aggressor unless you are ready to immediately take action. Instead, make boundaries known and track compliance. Seek small victories, not force big issues. #Russia  Biggest issue not even on Agenda: #TheArtic. 
#EpiVacCorona for #Venezuela: Another #vaccine, the usual #partners, a reprise of the same old praises from the regime to #Russia, and public matters (agreement terms and vaccination rollout) in a shroud of #disinformation   
While there are claims #Russia would like to discuss arms control, it has made no substantive effort toward nuclear stability. Instead, Russia violated the INF Treaty, abused the Open Skies Treaty &amp; continues to develop many new, destabilizing exotic nuclear weapons. More below⬇️

USIP: Ahead of this week’s Biden-Putin summit, the U.S. is signaling that it will rebuff #Russia over aggression — but ‘strategic stability’ offers room to talk. Read the latest from our James Rupert and Donald N. Jensen: 
The #US recognises India as “a major defence partner” as it prepares for a confrontation with #China. The special status gives India access to military technology but it comes with a caveat that India must not buy arms from #Russia.  By John Cherian. 
Thanks to @Padierfind who helped me in minting this #CNFT via the @nftmakerio platform (despite a dang mistake I made by entering Cyrillic characters 🤪).  It is an allusion to the current situation in #Russia as a hope it will "rainbow" soon. 🏳️‍🌈🇷🇺💕🌈❣️ 
##Russia#Moscow#citieswelivedin#bunnyandbear#adventures#ourlove#US#myperson 
In direct affronts to the U.S., #Putin has put the U.S. on a list of “unfriendly” countries, placed extreme limits on the U.S. Embassy in #Moscow, begun to force @RFERL out of #Russia, &amp; continues to hold Marines #TrevorReed &amp; #PaulWhelan hostage.
Just recently, #Russia amassed 100,000+ troops on #Ukraine's borders, imposed an economic blockade on Ukraine's exports, and Russian-backed militias continue to wage a proxy war against Ukraine.
Over the past 5 months, #Putin’s disregard of international norms has intensified. He has:   - imprisoned @Navalny - suppressed media and opposition leaders in #Russia  - been implicated in 2014 Czech Republic bombings &amp; in a Bulgaria spying scandal 
Perhaps the most favorite part of the interview! RT made it with the original Russian language so as to compare with the English translation part on the NBC. #China #Russia 
@USAmbUN #Ethiopia has rejected all non-voluntary international #intervention thru z #US, #EU or any external organ. #China and #Russia will continue rejecting any interference that doesn't recognize z Ethiopian state's primary right/responsibility/obligation 2 protect its own citizens.

My good friend @vkaramurza understands that releasing political prisoners is like cracking a dam holding back the will of the people. Demanding their release must be a top priority for all Western leaders. #democracy #Russia #Putin

#Turkey and #Azerbaijan strengthen their ties. #Russia stationed its troops in #Karabakh in the hope to forestall Turkey's growing influence, but it actually had a counter-effect: it increasingly pushes Baku to build stronger connection with Ankara to balance against Moscow.

@USAmbUN #China &amp; #Russia are hell bent on protecting the genocidal regime of @AbiyAhmedAli. They are the ones that have been hindering open debate about the ongoing campaign of genocide on the people of #Tigray. The #US &amp; its allies must consider to take actions outside the UN system.

#China #Russia  Ahead of the Biden-Putin summit in Geneva, China says it has an "unbreakable friendship" with Russia.   "I advise those who seek to draw a wedge between China and Russia, that any attempt to disrupt Sino-Russian ties is doomed to fail,"  
@USAmbUN They want to bombard us from their ships &amp; through #Sudan. But it’s impossible. A 100M plus nation will destabilize #Africa &amp; the rest of the world. On top of that #China &amp; #Russia will use it for their advantages. Those days are gone for #US to destabilize a country &amp; walk away.
As @ameliairheart indicated, this flight and recent P-8A Poseidon flights in this region, are most likely part of an ongoing NATO exercise in the region, this particular area being just over 200 km from 🇷🇺#Russia.
