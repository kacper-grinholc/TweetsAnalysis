In a first, #Russia deploys a couple of MiG-31K jet fighters armed with the new Kinzhal hypersonic missiles to join Tu-22M3 bombers at its Khmeimim Air Base in #Syria’s coastal province of Latakia, gaining striking capabilities in the east Mediterranean.
#Russia deployed MiG31s ​​armed with Kinzal missiles in #Syria. Planes armed with missiles considered threat to warships arrived there after #Britain sent new aircraft carrier to the region as part of the coalition against #ISIS remnants.
