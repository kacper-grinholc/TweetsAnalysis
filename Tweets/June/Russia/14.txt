I think it will be mutually exclusive. #Biden will make it clear where the red lines are, but so as #Putin will do so. Biden has like 50 years of experience in politics. He should know that you can't bully #Russia. I hope his advisors have enough knowledge of USSR/Russia studies 
@ChristopherJM It can be another 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 years from now. How long is #Turkey trying to be in the #EU? It should be a referendum in #Ukraine about #NATO. How about conflict in #Donbass, how about #Crimea? #Russia won't be just watching it. Ukraine is risking serious consequences.

@EyesOnIdlib There are several reports &amp; analysis - but many say that it was pushed forward by #Russia to put political pressure on #Turkey ahead of Putin's meeting with Biden &amp; trying to make Turkey think twice on their decisions on issues/relation with the US.
#Biden calls #Russia‚Äôs President #Putin a "worthy adversary‚Äù and he‚Äôll make clear in Geneva where areas of cooperation can be, but also ‚Äúmake it clear where the red lines are‚Äù. He said every #NATO leader who addressed the bilateral thanked him for the step. 
@Ukraine is currently at war with #Russia, which is occupying a vast swath of Ukraine's territory and blocking its sea routes.   By admitting Ukraine to @NATO, the alliance would necessarily have to enter that war with Russia on Ukraine's behalf.   This isn't a small favor to ask

Same shit, half a century later.  Race Riots #Racism  Demonizing #Russia  The disputed region known as #Israel.  Nothing has changed in more than 50 years. 
he also told the world that @JoeBiden "won't be doing anything impulsive" Looks like #Putin has given #JoeBiden his orders. We all know the "Big Guy" will comply. I bet there's another pipeline in the works to benefit #Russia 
There are currently over 400 political prisoners in #Russia. Every week we highlight those who are being illegally persecuted for their religious or political beliefs. Head over to our website to read more about the Kremlin‚Äôs political prisoners.

We, the people, deserve an explanation. Why does Joe get a free pass on things the media vilified Trump over? It was a Biden who got the Moscow Millions.  #PutinsPuppet #G7Summit  #Russia #Putin #MediaManipulation 
#Biden just confirmed #NATO's long-standing [impotent] stance on the #Ukraine membership: 1. Reiterated that ongoing #Russia invasion does not IN ITSELF preclude UA fr joining. 2. Mentioned that admittance will require "voting of other members US"+"UA work to do". #NATOSummit

It is important that President Biden speak to President Putin from a unified place, not a fractured one, where he just spoke from. #PresidentBiden #PresidentPutin #NATO #US #Russia #Biden #sanctions #strength #MondayMotivation #mondaythoughts #MondayVibes
@JoeBiden @POTUS starts a highly choreographed  curated questions form selected journos press conference with a statement encouraging all Americans to get vaccinated.  hmmm. and that's how you start a presser on #NATO #Turkey #Russia
I'm getting chemical character on this #Russia   Xinomavro from Boy Weinhaus - giving it 65pts
what should that bullshitspeech against #china and #russia be? i thought that fcking @NATO should be an organisation to bring peace in the world? since i moved from gdr to frg the #NATO got more aggressive every year! i hate the "all for the money" policy...

"Navalny's death would be another indication that Russia has little or no intention of abiding by basic, fundamental human rights" - Biden   via @atrupar #Russia
@I_Katchanovski #Zelensky of #Ukraine is not happy that he is being told to work on reforms. Zelensky. Since #NATO confirmed plans for a future membership of Ukraine into #NATO, #Russia would certainly built a foreign policy toward protecting own interests. I doubt it would be pretty for Ukraine

If it were true (I really doubt it), I hope #Russia places missiles in #Cuba and reopens its military bases on the island.  Americans want to get closer to #Moscow? Go ahead, but except none less from Russia. Washington will find itself a few minutes away of a nuclear strike.

In 2005, #Ukraine announced its intention to join NATO within 5 years.    At the time, Ukraine was reportedly on a fast track to NATO membership.   Zelensky's comments aim to muddy the waters between the US and #Russia, and are unlikely to result in immediate NATO membership.
On #Navalny, #Biden said his possible death would be another indication that #Russia has no interest in "respecting basic human rights."  Framed it as a red line for him if #Navalny dies.
#Russia recruits another ex-PM. This time, it is former French prime minister Fran√ßois Fillon. He is expected to work for Russian oil firm Zarubezhneft. Former German PM Gerhard Schr√∂der has been working as a lobbyist for Russian firm Gazprom for years now
.@POTUS: "@navalny's death would be tragic, would be nothing but hurt his (Putin's) relations with the rest of the world and with me." #Russia #Biden #Putin #NATOsummit
@tips_talk @hrrysgreysuit Just like the others. Except we are not selling #milk or access to #russia. Try again.

Plus #Russia and #China should create a mechanism to jointly sanction and even expel Western companies that abide by the aggressive stance of their govts against both countries.
Tensions are brewing between the US and Ukraine:   1) Zelensky said Biden should have met him before Putin  2) Zelensky expressed disappointment about no US sanctions on #Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline  3) Zelensky now demands clarity on #Ukraine's NATO position.
