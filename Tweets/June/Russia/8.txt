9 June 1672 - Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia, is born. He led a cultural revolution within the country which replaced outdated medieval traditions with modern, westernized ideas. He would found the city of Saint Petersburg in 1703. #OTD #History #PetertheGreat #Russia #Tsar

Was Born Today - Peter the Great  "He was a Russian czar in the late 17th century, who is best known for his extensive reforms in an attempt to establish Russia as a great nation."   #born #today #todayinhistory #history #politics #russia #peterthegreat #czar #reform #nation

#Serbia, #Russia and #Belarus hold joint military exercise    
Replying to my query about the threat by #Russia to pull out of @Space_Station unless US lifts sanctions on two companies related to the project, @PressSec replies there's traditionally been such cooperation and she'll have to ask @WHNSC about it.
You forgot to minus all the destruction #Assad and #Russia has caused which is why we are discussing reconstructed auction in the first place!

Proud to be an MP in a government standing up for Democracy in #Russia and for #Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.   🇨🇦's work is having an impact. Russia sanctioning @DavidLametti, @DLeBlancNB &amp; 7 others underlines this very fact.
