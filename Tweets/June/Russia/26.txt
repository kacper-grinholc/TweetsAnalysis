Some countries with a more historic antipathy toward the U.S. have been more receptive to the Russian vaccine ‚Ä¶ so even #COVID-19, which has hit #Russia hard, has become an area of competition between #Russia and the West, our @donaldnjensen says #OnPeace.

@Reuters "That tweet summarizes the true intention of all them, it's not objectivity, but hatred against Russia. If the story had been reversed, it would not say: "angered #Russia", but would accuse it in the worst way, as an invader, etc. We could almost accuse them of #xenophobia" -CER-

It looks that this clumsy analysis by a group of authors was made for the sake of pro-#Lukashenko title. When will "useful idiots" of all kinds understand that no one is more "poised to harm #Belarus and help #Russia" than the insane dictator?
