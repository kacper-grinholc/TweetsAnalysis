Good news:  #Libya Foreign Minister at #Berlin2 Conference, today:  Mercenaries in #Libya, either recruited by #Russia or #Turkey will be withdrawn from the country in the coming days.  👍That is very exciting to hear.

These doorways once led to shops around the Roman forum at Perge on the south coast of Turkey. Every sort of trade was carried on here, as depicted for other cities in my Roman-era novels:   #histfic #turkey #historicalfiction #roman #ancientrome 
As it became clear today at #Berlin II via statements by the international community, and yesterday by the #LNA, the agreement that all foreign forces &amp; mercenaries must leave. The only exception being #Turkey, which sees it forces as not “foreign”. 
#Turkey's central bank governor "told senior members of the Banks’ Association of Turkey on Tuesday that the Turkish central bank is in talks with four counterparts for new swap deals." @cagankoc's @economics report:

Let’s face it. If the international community is able to organize a conference on #Libya in #Berlin today that’s because #Turkey stood with the legitimate govt in Libya and balanced the power on the ground. Without Turkey, #Haftar would have established a dictatorship.  🇹🇷🧿🇱🇾 
Together with #NL Syria envoy Emiel de Bont I visited #Cilvegözü border crossing between #Turkey and #Syria. Impressive humanitarian operation going on there. Turkey has been sheltering 3.5 million Syrian refugees for a decade which deserves great respect.

#Algeria plans to welcome #Turkey's defence companies.   This gives Turkey's defence companies a beachhead in North Africa and also partially dilutes #Russia's decades of hegemony in Algeria's defence sector.
@EssexJarv @its_johnmartin @EdwardJDavey @LibDems 51.9% many of whom believed the lies about £350m per week for the #NHS &amp; #Turkey joining the #EU (when will that be happening btw?) #EU citizens weren’t allowed to vote even though #brexit has had a major effect on them - many have gone home, but that’s what some really wanted!

#Turkey would have realised implications of sending troops is not rosy option. Taliban &amp; terrorists will not concede the space to them. If #Russia &amp; #US couldn't sustain, Turkey will not be able to do so. @asthana_shashi @InsightGL 
By withdrawing its troops #USA &amp; #NATO , have created a vacuum for #Pakistan from geostrategic point of view. Now the geopolitical, financial strain &amp; tensions on Pakistan is 100 times higher.  The risk &amp; isolation will worsen. #Afghanistan , #India , #Iran , #Turkey 
In Libyan conflict mercenaries are not the problem - they came secretly and secretly can be withdrawn. But withdrawn of  Turkish troops will be  shameful for #Turkey so they will not leave easily. It must be serious reason for them to leave #Libya. But we don't see it.

🇹🇷😀👎 anticipating the dirty state/republic of @RTErdogan!  #Turkey will withdraw its mercenaries from Libya/Syria/Azerbaijan, and will redeploy them to Afghanistan in a desperate attempt to support the existing pro-Turkish Afghan militia groups.
