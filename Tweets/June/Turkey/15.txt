Congratulations to @nadinemaenza ! A good friends to #Yezidi #Yazidi and other religious minorities , fearless advocate, and outspoken critic of the many aggressions committed by various parties in #Syria and #Iraq , such as by #ISIS #Daesh , #Turkey , #AlQaeda , and others. 
#Turkey continues to attack #PKK members, this time killing senior official at refugee camp in northern Iraq. #Erdogan must be condemned by all UN members. This ruthless dictator is attending #NATO summit w/ western leaders, who must take him to task over his actions.
The #Shusha Declaration on Allied Relations was signed between the two fraternal countries on a very important date for #Azerbaijan - June 15 - the National Salvation Day, 100 years after the Treaty of Kars. #Turkey  
Radical #Turkey radicalizing the youth of their country. The Infidel &amp; Apostate beware as #Turkey influences all over #Africa &amp; the #MiddleEast without friction from world leaders. #China MUST counter in #Africa preserving native culture. #TurkeyOutOfNATO
#Turkey president suggested #Pakistan military to cooperate with #Turkey forces to secure #Kabul_International_Airport.
