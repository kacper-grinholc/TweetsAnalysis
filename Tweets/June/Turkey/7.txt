White House NSA Jake Sullivan said next week's Biden-Erdogan mtg will have an 'expansive' agenda incl. Eastern Med, Nagorno-Karabakh, Syria, Afghanistan but also will look at the 'significant differences' US &amp; #Turkey have. "Pres Biden knows Erdogan very well" Sullivan notes. 
#Greece has designated #Turkey as a safe third country for #asylum seekers from #Syria, #Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Somalia. But Turkey has not accepted returns from Greece since March 2020. Applicants rendered inadmissible from now will end up in prolonged destitution
Human rights in #Turkey  is behind bars since 67 days. Many victims have no voice to resist persecutions. Mafia like state increases oppression day by day.   Gergerlioğlu 67GündürHapis #FreeGergerlioglu  @hrw @RebHarms @NordhausenFrank  By @channeldraw

#Turkey under Erdogan is one of the few countries that  managed to equally annoy Dems and Republicans. Unlike Putin, that thug hasn't figured out yet how to latch on to a culture war issue and rehabilitate his image with half the country.
