- @UNHCR officials have called for #Turkey to receive more support from the international community to handle the #refugee issue #RefugeeDay @OmarKadkoy 
#Turkey Today (19.06.2021) 📌 72 Bar Association Presidents condemned in a statement the attack on HDP Izmir Provincial Organization and the killing of Deniz Poyraz. 📌 Police forces in Batman intervened against protests regarding the attacks on HDP and the murder of HDP (1/4) 
@Sinan418241 @TK42130112795 @Greek_Genocide That photo has already been ruled as Turkish propaganda. Turks kill their own if it means more power, money and greed.  The photo was staged in 1973 so, that would give an opening to invade #Cyprus in 1974. Same thing happened with the Istanbul pogrom in 1955. #Greece #Turkey.

I believe that we will clearly recognize the importance of #AntalyaDiplomacyForum in a short time.  On the other hand, we will witness regional and global outputs in a few years.  #Turkey is the leading country in every field.🇹🇷

#Turkey has received 5 million more doses of the #COVID19Vaccine developed by #China's #Sinovac , the state-run Anadolu news agency said on Saturday, as President Tayyip Erdogan voiced hope of a rebound in the tourism sector.
#Kenya- #Turkey relations. But MFA should now find a new line. This has become monotonous. Be specific and also explain. What was agreed? What deals were signed or will be signed? Make use of #digitaldiplomacy

#Turkey #Propaganda #Negationism #ArmenianGenocide  There is no proof that the man who appears is a student nor that he was questioned by the french secret services.   The story told by @trtworld is a propaganda piece to denigrate the teaching of the #ArmenianGenocide in #France. 
#Armenia's neighbour "allies" are "circumstantial" allies,  - #Russia, an "ally" also of #Turkey, has largely done nothing during the latest round of fighting to protect Armenia; - The "friendship" of Armenia and #Iran is nothing else but a partnership of convenience.

@AyishaMuhamad @Mary_Hogin @trtworld In fact, it's #Turkey who rejected to accept the results of the investigation &amp; research done foreign scholars in the last 100 yrs. Why? Because 🇹🇷 wants to re-write history. Truth is 🇹🇷 is a genocidal country. Even the @TheDailyShow knows everyone hates🇹🇷

#Turkey has never had a combat force in #Afghanistan. Turkish soldiers have never engaged in an armed confrontation and never fired a bullet in the country. If they are not much serious in helping #ANDSF then they mustn’t help in the airport too.   #ANDSFAbleToSecureKabulAirport
Turkey’s current military presence in #Afghanistan is limited to a battalion of about 500 soldiers involved in non-combat missions. People in Afghanistan are suspicious about #Turkey’s intentions and claim that it can be dangerous for them.   #ANDSFAbleToSecureKabulAirport

Of course. But what is #PresidentBiden saying about his #NATO ally #Erdogan killing #Kurds every day of the year? Did he not see the news: Turkish fascist state is carrying out coordinated attacks, all over #Turkey today, on protests against the racist murder of #DenizPoyraz? 
U.S. and #Turkey have agreed to a plan for the Turks to continue providing security at the airport in Kabul ensuring the U.S. and other nations can maintain a diplomatic presence following the withdrawal of troops, expected by next month but we say  #ANDSFAbleToSecureKabulAirport
