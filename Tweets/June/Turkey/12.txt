As for the reason for this escalation, #Russia has been working lately to put pressure on #Turkey to make concessions, the most important of which is the opening of the Latakia-Aleppo highway and the opening of commercial crossings between areas of Assad and Syrian opposition.6/8

Public opinion is growing that Western nations/ #NATO  states are least concerned about terrorists operating against #Pakistan &amp; #Turkey such as PKK, TTP, JA, BLA &amp; BLF. Steps must be taken to address such apprehensions. @State_SCA @NATOlizer @FranceinPak @SwissAmbPak @DKinPK

Traitor and terrorist KDP is just using KRG as a cover to continue their duties to the occupiers of Kurdistan.  The truth is KDP and MIT banned activists from entering #Kurdistan. Terrorist #KDP and traitor #barzani clan literally became the watchdog of terrorist #turkey

As U.S. and Europe forge a new trade and tech alliance, it is important #Turkey have a seat at the table.  Turkey's Custom Union with the EU and strategic manufacturing/sourcing base for Europe are key to this equation.
