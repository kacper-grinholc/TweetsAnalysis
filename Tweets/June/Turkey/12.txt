As for the reason for this escalation, #Russia has been working lately to put pressure on #Turkey to make concessions, the most important of which is the opening of the Latakia-Aleppo highway and the opening of commercial crossings between areas of Assad and Syrian opposition.6/8 
Thirdly, #Russia has started a military escalation against the areas controlled by the Syrian armed opposition days ago, which included heavy bombing of the area in the southern countryside of #Idlib, Jabal Al-Zawiya and Sahil Al-Ghab.5/8  #Turkey #Assad #USA #EU #NATO

From my point of view, the Russian forces supporting the #Assad militia are responsible for this attack for several reasons. First, #Moscow has targeted hospitals belonging to the Syrian opposition in previous times.3/8 #Turkey #Russia #Assad #USA #EU
