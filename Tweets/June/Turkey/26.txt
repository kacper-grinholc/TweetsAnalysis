#Turkey is already shown high levels of sympathy particularly by the Sunni and Turkish-origin communities in northern Lebanon. 🇹🇷 adopted the aim of developing communication with all of the parties involved, as evidenced by the visits of Lebanese groups to #Ankara
In #Lebanon, where political conflicts between different sects have become a chronic issue, a stable environment likely to be created with the support of #Turkey would be making a positive contribution to the other conflict zones in the #Middle_East as well.
With its strategic importance in terms of the energy reserves in the Eastern Mediterranean and their transfer to the world markets, as well as with its many sectarian-religious communities, #Lebanon clearly needs #Turkey’s stabilizing role.

The fact that the Turkish hospital built by Turkey in #Sayda is in a Hezbollah-controlled area may also be a sign that Hezbollah does not have a radical attitude towards #Turkey.
#Hezbollah will not be averse to #Turkey’s role in Lebanon, hoping that it would help to break the Saudi-Emirati influence in the country and also serve as a new counterweight to Israel 👇
The leaders of #Lebanon, #Syria, #Iraq, #Turkey and the #UAE sent similar messages of support and congratulations.  A spokesperson for #Hamas, the #Palestinian militant group that runs #Gaza, wished Iran "progress and prosperity".
You are attacking your sons, daughters, brothers, sisters. Are you proud, #Turkey? 
#Turkey   A country that has denied the fate of its minorities for more than a century only admits one model: hatred against all those who are different in gender, intelligence, rationalism, thought, ideas, ...   In short, it only admits authoritarianism or fascism.
