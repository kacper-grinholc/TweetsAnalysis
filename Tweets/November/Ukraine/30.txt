#Ukraine’s foreign minister Kuleba is expected to raise the issue of #Russia’s blocking of the #OSCE SMM, Trilateral Contact Group, and violating the #Minsk agreements, during his meetings in Riga and Stockholm. Ukraine will seek a “comprehensive package” for deterring Russia.
#Ukraine’s defense minister Reznikov believes #Putin’s aggressive actions in Ukraine is a form of pressure on Biden ahead of a meeting in December to review the Geneva summit outcomes. #NATO and #OSCE ministerials will serve as important venues for building support for Ukraine.
#Lavrov is baselessly accusing #Ukraine of preparing for a “military adventure” against #Russia, and posing a “direct threat” - none of which is true. Russian senior officials bluntly distort facts, demonstrating that Russian behavior cannot be changed with any compromises.
#Putin claims the build-up of forces at #Ukraine's borders is aimed at “improving relations” in the area of security. His comments exemplify #Russia’s twisted approach to international relations, which relies on the use of force and propaganda.  THREAD:

As Poland plans to station US nuclear weapons on its territory, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko announced to deploy Russian nuclear weapons on the territory of his country. #NATO deterrent! This is how the #Ukraine effect is fomenting.

The 2021 Index found #Ukraine and #Moldova to be the joint frontrunners, with #Georgia in third position.   Well, it's not so great #EaP   
The moment #terrorist Russia takes more Ukrainian territory, or any other territory, we as #NATO are to nuke Moscow, St. Petersburg and Vladivostok. No questions asked.  Stand with occupied #Moldova, #Georgia, #Ukraine

#Kremlin dictator proves that he is a lousy history reader. He neither knows about the 1990 Paris Charter @OSCE, nor learns any lessons from this 1880-81 historic Ilya Repin painting about the character of #Ukrainian nation. #Ukraine #Finland  via @FT 
Olga Bielkova has been a reputed energy expert, and later an MP specializing in the field, before joining top management of #Ukraine's #natgas transit company. Listen to what she has to say (very diplomatically) on the #NordStream2:

Very discouraging news on how the German🇩🇪 government, led by Merkel, tried to persuade #Biden not to sanction #NS2. Really hope that #Ampel coalition's🔴🟡🟢 policy will be tougher on #Putin and NS2. It’s important not just for #Ukraine, but for the whole Europe.
TOA today @JMTG_Ukraine between @cascaderifles and the 53rd IBCT from @FLGuard!  Very proud of both of these formations. The mission continues in #Ukraine.  Building readiness for our allies and partners every day throughout Europe! @7thATC  @USArmyEURAF  @USEmbassyKyiv 
Support for #Ukraine has been politicized.  Ukraine isn't Democrat or Republican. It's not Labour or Tory. It's not Liberal or Conservative.   Ukraine isn't and should never be a partisan issue. People allowed it to be. Can never forgive that.
