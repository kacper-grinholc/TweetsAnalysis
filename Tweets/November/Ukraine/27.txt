#Holodomor history is also vital to understanding Russia’s ongoing war on #Ukraine. #Russia has long oppressed Ukrainians, whose independence &amp; very identity Putin–like Stalin–tries to suppress &amp; control. Learn more here:  #HolodomorRemembranceDay
Of course, #Ukraine is not a member of #NATO (nor otherwise a beneficiary of a #MAP), it is not covered by the Article 5 guarantee (thank you Bucharest summit...). However, was it appropriate now to use this language? #dissuasion
"If it was not clear enough, according to its SG, in case of new attacks by #Russia on Ukraine, @NATO won't defend #Ukraine, the response brought would be to bases of economic sanctions and reinforced bases near Ukraine (with the success that we know since 2014)." Strange signal.

Every day in Europe's granary, about 10,000 people died from hunger.  Robbed of their food, every day about 400 died every hour.  An estimated 4-7 million men, women &amp; children died slow agonizing deaths.  Today we commemorate 1932-1933 #Holodomor &amp; #Stalin's genocide in #Ukraine

If #Russian tanks and troops are amassing at #Ukraine's borders, then how is it 'malicious #US propaganda'? 
On #Ukraine frontline, soldiers vow 'worthy response' to #Russia 
According to MilitaryMaps, against the background of rising tensions between #Russia and NATO over #Ukraine , all nuclear submarines of the Pacific Fleet of #Russian Navy in a state of combat readiness left their places of deployment and went on alert duty
Movement against Capitulation &amp; Democratic Axe that are linked to Poroshenko &amp; far right demand that #Zelensky fire head of Office of President of #Ukraine  as "Russian agent" and call “state treason” any negotiations with #Russia and peaceful resolution of civil war in #Donbas.

#Ukraine's President #VolodymyrZelensky says #Russian "representatives" are planning to overthrow his government next week, as a Russian troop build-up sparks fears of an #invasion. 
People should remember that #Ukraine present government is the result of a coup lead by the USA #CIA a short time ago.  #Marines #Navy #Army #airforce are letting go a lot over refusal to take shot  #NATO chief warns #Russia on troop build-up. 
#Ukraine #Belarus suffered #Soviet and #Stalin Terror.  In #Russia #Putin is trying to undo this memory! #Memorial 
The #Ukraine serviceman killed in #Russia attacks in #Donbas yesterday Nov 26 is named as PfC Ali Nahib Al Hasleh with the 54th Mech. Bde.: @Novynarnia citing civilian &amp; military press services. In my understanding, the 1st Arab-Ukrainian soldier to ever die for the country. RIP
Don’t quite believe anything that #Russia says at this point, especially regarding #Ukraine.  Mind you, I feel equal distrust towards US and China too. All have failing democracies or autocracies.   🔗@CBCNews  
In Korosten, Zhytomyr region, activists attacked journalists of the "separatist" TV channel "NASH" #ukraine 
One of alleged organizers of coup against #Zelensky on December 1-2 in interview to #Ukrainian media denies involvement in supposed coup &amp; contacts with Akhmetov &amp; says that he lives in Kyiv. He was not even interrogated by law enforcement in #Ukraine.  
Analysts see build-up as part of a multi-pronged provocation against the West. #IWPR #Ukraine #Russia #Crisis 
After #Russian #military buildup near #Ukraine, #Putin then launches #ASAT weapon that almost destroys @Space_Station and then @POTUS has @NATO bombers practice nuking #Russia 20 km away from Russian border. Promoting Russia to sign new alliance w/ #China. All avoidable!!
In April, @JoeBiden removed #sanctions on #NordStream2. Then @BorisJohnson initiates a hugely provocative action in the #BlackSea which results in #Russia dropping bombs directly in front of #British warship. Then @POTUS does similar act prompting #Russian buildup near #Ukraine.
On #HolodomorRemembranceDay together with our Ukrainian friends #Latvia mourns millions of people of #Ukraine who perished during famine organized by Stalin’s regime in 1932-1933. These crimes shall never be forgotten and shall never be forgiven @DmytroKuleba @MFA_Ukraine
If @JoeBiden and @BorisJohnson would stop provoking #Russia in the #BlackSea while flooding world markets w/ cheap North American #oil &amp; #natural #gas while giving lethal aid to #Ukraine &amp; #Visegrad states (and creating #Space #BASED #missile #defense) #Russia would be deterred.
@RepBrianFitz You were #SilentBrian during SCIF testimony. You knew Trump lied about #Shokin &amp; #Biden. Ignored heroes @AVindman &amp; Ambassador  Yovanovitch. You could have protected #Ukraine but chose Trump &amp; voted AGAINST impeachment You chose #PartyOverCountry  #PA01 deserves better
BBC News - Russia-Ukraine border: Why Moscow is stoking tensions  #Russia #Ukraine #UkraineConflict #NATO #UnitedStates #Europe #Geopolitics
Interestingly, #Trump had deterred #Russia from attacking non-@NATO member #Ukraine for the entirety of his presidency. He flooded world markets w/ N. American #oil &amp; #natural #gas keeping price low, hamstringing Russia’s economy &amp; slowing their war machine. @Biden changed that.
Russia has no plans to invade Ukraine and suggestions to the contrary are malicious U.S. propaganda, Moscow's foreign intelligence chief said on Saturday."  #Russia  #Ukraine russia  #conflictodeintereses  @sp 
#Putin is a threat to world peace. If he thinks he can get away with it #Russia will invade #Ukraine. The only thing stopping him is concern about what other nations, specifically the #USA, will do about it. One day he will miscalculate, and that is worrying. 
#FoxNewsSunday Not 7 mos, #Pantygone ramp to The #Ukraine. #NATO at Putin's Doorstep. Or. Druther. #RedLine. And #TheBidenBarberShop in 2024! "...rockets red glare... ".... dawn's early light... "....all the mushroom clouds still there!" (Pandemic solved. (#ClimateChange solved.)
As Russia masses troops once more at the border to threaten #Ukraine, on #Holodomor Memorial Day, we remember and pray for the souls of the millions who perished when Stalin’s Soviet regime tried to destroy the Ukrainian people, culture and spirit in the forced famine of 1933
#Nepal is not #Ukraine  #GTFO #WeRsanatani
Perfect gas lighting by #Putin pretending with ease that the West is causing conflicts on Russian borders.  Blink twice and remember where the #Russian soldiers are today #NATO #Crimea #Ukraine  
A US-Russia war over #Ukraine would be catastrophic
