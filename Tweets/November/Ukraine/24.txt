@McFaul Either #NATO works with #Ukraine to develop a clear action plan or Russia will further extend its imperialistic tentacles into Europe and cost the West even more to eradicate. Doing nothing is a financial disaster plan.
@eucopresident @KremlinRussia_E There is only one way of de-escalation: #Putin ends the occupation of #Ukraine, and #Lukashenka ends attacks on the Polish border.  The only way to pressure both of them is through sanctions. Do not feed dictators and their thugs.

@MarkAmesExiled Supporting a war on #China over #Taiwan? Very sad. But supporting a war on #Russia over #Ukraine is really, really, really worse. American earthflatters are less insane.
Waiting for someone else to do something "right" while you suffer is a poor way to go through life.  It could but so what? #Ukraine should be raising the costs to Russia.  If only my "bully" "abuser" would stop doing, is not going to work. EVER!  Onus has always been on Ukraine. 
#Russia, mentioned only after the #EaP, #Ukraine &amp; #Belarus, is reminded of its intl commitments. Coherence of bilateral relations with joint EU interests &amp; relations is supposed to be increased, and Central &amp; Eastern European concerns are supposed to be heard (finally). (5/10)

@Biz_Ukraine_Mag The US would be advised to move one or two tank divisions and fighter planes to Poland and make it clear to the Russians that an attack on Ukraine would mean war.  Russia only understands the language of hardship appeasement is interpreted as weakness.  #USA #Ukraine #Germany #EU

In eastern #Ukraine, long-running conflict means that people often find it difficult to access healthcare. In some villages, volunteers supported by @MSF are providing transport &amp; health information to help people get the medical care they need.

The new German government has pointed to #Russia's responsibility, not #Ukraine's, for implementing the #Minsk agreements. I hope the new government will also point to Frau #Merkel's responsibility for partially justifying #Putin's policy toward Ukraine.

2. States such as #Ukraine, #Moldova &amp; #Georgia, which are striving to join the EU, should be able to move closer through consistent rule-of-law and market-economy reforms. We will react decisively and reliably to democratic upheavals and be a partner to the democracy movements.
