An opinion Dr Lee, we all are entitled to :-), will wait till the fat lady sings, emotional issue everyone assume it will happen esp. after 70 years’  reunification. US did civil war &amp; yes #Russia wants #UKraine 
@McFaul Either #NATO works with #Ukraine to develop a clear action plan or Russia will further extend its imperialistic tentacles into Europe and cost the West even more to eradicate. Doing nothing is a financial disaster plan.
@eucopresident @KremlinRussia_E There is only one way of de-escalation: #Putin ends the occupation of #Ukraine, and #Lukashenka ends attacks on the Polish border.  The only way to pressure both of them is through sanctions. Do not feed dictators and their thugs.

#Russia carried out a military drill on naval bases in the Black Sea, south of #Ukraine, with about ten crews of combat planes and ships that targeted hypothetical enemy warships, the Black Sea Fleet’s press office said on Wednesday.
Which NATO and the U.S. will never give. So likely further invasion at this point. Most likely up to the Dnieper to cut #Ukraine in half. The only question is when it kicks off.

#Russia has buildups along the #Ukraine border; some (including the IC) expect military action.  I personally think it’s a response to keep tensions high amidst the migrant crisis between Poland and Belarus.  Think: this could get the EU to be more stressed IOT pressure Poland.

🇺🇸🇺🇦⚡The American Embassy in Kiev raises the level of threat to US citizens on the territory of Ukraine in connection with "the military activity of the Russian Armed Forces on the Ukrainian border and in Crimea." #USA #Ukraine
When does #Ukraine see the light and get the nuclear weapons?  It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. 
@Biz_Ukraine_Mag The US would be advised to move one or two tank divisions and fighter planes to Poland and make it clear to the Russians that an attack on Ukraine would mean war.  Russia only understands the language of hardship appeasement is interpreted as weakness.  #USA #Ukraine #Germany #EU
10. We call for an immediate end to the #destabilization attempts against #Ukraine, the #violence in #easternUkraine and the #annexation of #Crimea in violation of #internationallaw. @crimeaplatform @donbassrealii @novostidnua_en @EESRIorg @qhacrimeaqha @NewsCrimeaEn @CrimeaEU

In eastern #Ukraine, long-running conflict means that people often find it difficult to access healthcare. In some villages, volunteers supported by @MSF are providing transport &amp; health information to help people get the medical care they need.

Are there others who cringe at the news about build-ups of "forces" along the #Ukraine/Russia border and #NATO exercises in European states bordering #Russia? Sounds like a bunch of children playing games - except that the stakes are ALL of the rest of us. Childish behaviour.

The new German government has pointed to #Russia's responsibility, not #Ukraine's, for implementing the #Minsk agreements. I hope the new government will also point to Frau #Merkel's responsibility for partially justifying #Putin's policy toward Ukraine.
But I'm curious to see if and how something will move!  Future German government of SPD, the Greens &amp; Free Democrats say "#Ukraine, #Moldova &amp; #Georgia that are striving to join the EU should be able to move closer ...”  via @CivilGe
2. States such as #Ukraine, #Moldova &amp; #Georgia, which are striving to join the EU, should be able to move closer through consistent rule-of-law and market-economy reforms. We will react decisively and reliably to democratic upheavals and be a partner to the democracy movements.
#USA advised their citizens in #Ukraine over unusual #Russian military activities at border with #Ukraine

Stock up on buckwheat. Oleg Lyashko said that Zelensky "plans to introduce martial law in #Ukraine at the NSDC on December 1." 
#Democrats &amp; #Republicans don't just destroy American lives. Here they are defending #Nazi ideology at the #UnitedNations! The US is literally the 4th Reich. That installed a Nazi regime in #Ukraine! So that explains the real Rot voting NO! What about the 53 abstaining?

#Ukraine, which has accused #Russia of massing troops nearby and says #Belarus could send migrants over its borders, launches an operation to strengthen its frontier, including military drills for anti-tank and airborne units.
