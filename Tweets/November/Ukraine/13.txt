Scale of terrifying Russian invasion plot exposed as Putin sets sights on four countries #Ukraine  
Well #Putin's word means 💩.  Just like they denied #doping, invading #Ukraine, shooting down #MH17, various assassinations/attempts including Skripals using chemical weapons, poisoning #Navalny, cyberattacks, etc.  Again, Putin's word means absolutely nothing. 
At a time of intense speculation over #Russia's intentions towards #Ukraine, I am sharing again @ALanoszka's and my recent paper in @MWC_Journal 'Russia’s rising military and communication power: From Chechnya to Crimea' (open access, free to read)   
Worrying: “The #Kremlin increasingly views Ukraine as a Western aircraft carrier parked just across from Rostov Oblast in southern #Russia. #Ukraine is now one of the largest recipients of U.S. military assistance, a fact that surely is not lost on anyone  
@andrewsweiss Your painting a picture of #Putin as some kind of “winner” is deeply flawed. Despite being gifted an energy bonanza he has blown the opportunity to modernise the country by not investing in its people &amp; retaining talent. He has also lost #Ukraine for ever by overplaying his hand.
The United States has warned European allies that Russia could be plotting to invade #Ukraine in a repeat of the 2014 annexation of Crimea. 
I invite you to read my new post: • #USA and #Ukraine Sign Charter on Strategic Partnership  #Moscow #Kyiv #Russia #Washington #StopRussianAggression #ExpelRussiafromUkraine #CrimeaisUkraine

Risk of accidental war with #Russia highest in decades, general warns   #military #politics #Foreignaffairs #ukraine
Ukraine’s FM Kuleba correctly analyzes events on Polish-Belarus border, saying crisis is caused by Moscow’s hybrid war vs #Europe. One Russian war is hybrid while the one vs #Ukraine is a hot, shooting war. Free world must subdue #Moscow. Ban #Russia from global events.
The imperialist powers are using far-right layers in Poland and Ukraine to increase pressure on Russia. They are denying refugees their rights and creating tensions that could erupt in a European war. #Belarus #Ukraine 
@Anton_Astrey From space, I understand you can't hear anybody scream. In #Russian occupied #Ukraine, #HumanRights abuses are prevalent, and being a passenger in the #ISS, miles above any violence in #Simferopol should be no excuse for ignorance.
How many lives to be sacrificed? The DPR &amp; LPR do not want to be part of #Ukraine. Kiev cannot get #Donbass back by force. #NATO has no legitimacy to do this job, nor interest to launch a war vs #Russia. And Moscow fails to finish what it started in 2014. Meanwhile, people die.😏 
Why are the #elites so enamored of Soros? Because he was ruthless enough to set up his own people for death. #BlackTwitter #BlackPride #GeorgySoros #HunterBiden  #Jews #Ukraine 
“#Putin took #Crimea, which is very good, but he lost #Ukraine. If Putin also loses #Belarus, he will never be forgiven.”  To reduce this risk, the Kremlin could pull back #Lukashenko ties and open them with the opposition. 
EU focused on issues at the border of Poland and #Belarus . Meanwhile Russian military forces are gathering on the border with #Ukraine . Total coincidence I'm sure.
It never occur to Warmongers that #Yelnya is far further away from #Donbass than is #Kiev? Yelnya is 160 Miles from border with #Ukraine as crow flies &amp; a further 350 miles from borders of #Donbass - that is 500+ Miles! Do Troops massed in #Idaho threaten #Cleveland?

This is about the only thing against the US, he stands firm is #Ukraine. 
#Russia is not party to conflict in #Donbass and will never agree to the opposite - #Putin  #NormandyFormat #Ukraine
“Risk of an accidental armed conflict is higher than during the Cold War.”  And Putin is pretending to be the good guy.  #HybridWar #Belarus #Ukraine #WeAreNATO  
128-113-14 YTD, add #Finland +0.5: unlikely to catch #France but #WCQUALIFIERS playoff possible. Draw &amp; #FIN equal #Ukraine for 2nd, defend and counter mentality should remain. #Bosnia should push to win, don't have much offensively w/o Dzeko. Line should be 1/4 #WCQ2022 #BIHFIN

USA is pushing Ukraine towards war with Russia again, but Kyiv is no longer taking the bait  #Ukraine has simply lost all its leverage against #Russia, and now, it survives at the mercy of #Moscow and #VladimirPutin 
On #Ukraine, Putin highlights the key concern that we outlined in our paper: “It’s not Ukraine in NATO that bothers the Kremlin.  It’s NATO being in Ukraine.” 4/

On European security, #France 🇫🇷 is trying to leverage dialogue with #Russia 🇷🇺   Eg. Deterring a Russian invasion of #Ukraine 🇺🇦 and managing the #Belarus 🇧🇾 border crisis   Meanwhile, France-Russia tension s are escalating over #Mali 🇲🇱   Can these trends be compartmentalized?

Trouble in #Ukraine, #Belarus ?  Massing Russian troops, border stressing and energy squeezes are all part of 'total war'...but will it get serious? #VladimirPutin @NATO @hugobrady @DavidKilcullen #Lithuania
