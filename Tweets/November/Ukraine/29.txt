@arawnsley @ChristopherJM As I truly feel sorry for #Ukraine, only romantics would hope that #Germany or even the West would go into real war against #Russia over Ukraine or over #NordStream2. Why would Germany destroy own gas project like Nord Stream2? It's like opening a house to looters to trash it.
@ChristopherJM Why are the Western media, politicians getting surprised about joint military drills in #Belarus with #Russia? After all, it's a response to #Ukraine's drills along with NATO. If one side can do it, I don't see why the other side can't. Provoking Russia can be costly to Ukraine
