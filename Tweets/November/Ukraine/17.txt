@KurtBW_News @UKACSC @MarkGaleotti 5) Well I will also add that #Ukraine is crucial for Russia but because Russia believes it is Russian they have deployed soft power over many centuries, initially reflexively, to convince themselves and others that it does not exist and stigmatised Ukrainian identity.

#Ukraine: To strengthen security, Kyiv is deploying the 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade of the National Guard to the border with Belarus. 
Ukraine's President #Zelensky:  Discussed the possibility of EU assistance for the arrangement of the #Ukraine-#Belarus border, as well as the possibility of creating a regional platform for enhancing energy security with the #EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. 
@KurtBW_News @UKACSC @MarkGaleotti 2) All of them were toxic ethno nationalists on #Ukraine - eg. largely because Ukraine's history cancels out Moscow's founding myth - this is at the heart of Putin's "strategy" as it was at the heart of Stalin's if we can call genocide terrorism etc such

@haynesdeborah @james_rogers @StarychSam @TomTugendhat @Telegraph Don’t forget to listen to our latest #Geostrategy360 podcast as well, in which @StarychSam talks to Lithuanian Ambassador @RenatasNorkus (@LTEMBASSYUK) about the situation on Europe's eastern flank in #Poland, #Belarus, #Lithuania, #Estonia and #Ukraine. 
#Britain is playing an important role in reinforcing #Europe’s borders with its strategic and financial support for #Ukraine. @haynesdeborah explains more in this article: 
@mfa_russia Could that perhaps be due to #Russia’s invasion &amp; temporary occupation of #Ukraine’s #Crimea &amp; #Donbas regions?  Or maybe it’s due to #Moscow’s recent build up of troops next to 🇺🇦’s border?  Perhaps b/c the #Kremlin attempts to holds the #BlackSea hostage?  #RussiaInvadedUkraine 
On #Ukraine and the battle against #antisemitism. 
Three Ukrainian soldiers wounded due to fighting today. The Ukrainian villages of Kryakivka and Prychepylivka in the #Luhansk region were under fire with 152 mm artillery. #Russia #Ukraine

#Ukraine claims 100,000 Russian troops have amassed at the border. @SecBlinken said invasion is possible. This comes on the heels of #Russia’s and its allies’ perceived aggression toward #Europe by manufacturing a gas and migration crisis. 
💬 #Zakharova: On November 13, it was announced that the #UK &amp; #Ukraine had signed an agreement providing for a loan to Kiev in the amount of £ 1.7 billion. for 10 years.  ❗️ This is yet another proof of the buildup of British military activity in the states bordering on Russia.

Lots of signaling between #Russia and #Ukraine (and #NATO too) with recent RUS buildup and responses. While no need to panic, misunderstanding regarding each other's red lines and motivations may still be a recipe for new clashes.

Translated: #Britain &amp; #Ukraine finalised treaty that will enable #Britain provide loan to #Ukraine which will enable #Ukraine to pay for old #British warships and other weapons so #Britain doesn't have bear expenses to scrap them 🤗 
Crucially, the investigation doesn't seem to meet widespread expectations to prove the allegations that #Ukraine President #Zelensky's and/or his aides deliberately sabotaged the UA spy op or betrayed it to #Russia (and/or her #Belarus dependency). NOR does it disprove them. 3/x
The story also shed much light on #Ukraine intelligence/security services HUR (incorrectly called GUR in the story) &amp; SBU - showing them, I'd say, more motivated, capable and sophisticated than most UA public, and even servicemen, thought. Again, still unverified. 2/3
