@TomacMarti @TigerKnowz @LawDavF It's the same old tired rubbish from the Kremlin. First its  Russia-led republics in eastern Ukraine spread the offensive disinformation lie, then the Kremlin picks it up. Numerous times every year they bang on about #Ukraine's planning an offensive. AND Ukraine never does.
ITS TIME THE #WORLD WAKE THE FUK UP ! #BIDEN #FAKE #POTUS -FAKE!- #EUROPE &amp; #AMERICA MUST WAKE UP - STOP DOING BUSINESS WITH #RUSSIA #IRAN #IRAQ #AFGHANISTAN #CHINA  NOW ! #USA CAN SUPPLY THE PLANET WITH #FUEL DONT GIVE RUSSIA MONEY WHEN THEY USE IT FOR WAR #UKRAINE NEED OUR HELP 
Instead of wondering what the risk of war between #Russia and #Ukraine is - the #West should be actively defending Ukraine as the war has been on, since Russia annexed the #Crimea and Eastern Ukraine &amp; has troops and 'Advisors' on Ukraine territory 
Let's pray it doesn't come to war. I have visited Ukraine and admire their thirst for democracy. - What is the risk of a war between #Russia and #Ukraine?
Translation: Any defensive move by #Ukraine will be used as an excuse to launch an invasion by the Kremlin. 
@Andy_Scollick @LawDavF "freedman" is the tip-off: #Ukraine-hate is the norm. Notice freedman  amplifies "kaplan" &amp; "kofman," &amp; tell me you don't see a pattern of those who hate democratic #Ukraine. It's actually so obvious and disgusting.

#UPDATE🇺🇸🇷🇺 American and Russian officials currently on the phone discussing the #Ukraine🇺🇦 situation, diplomacy seems to be prevailing
@ChristopherJM @haltman When Javelins were authorized for #Ukraine, it was specifically indicated by #US that Ukrainian military should not use Javelins in #Donbass region. If it was used in combat, it means that #Zelensky has violated such agreement between US and Ukraine.
Do it. Russia has no veto on the matter. And if they invade further they will reap consequences. #Ukraine  
In occupied #Crimea, this #Russia|n tank is fitted with what looks like a type of slat armour over the turret specifically designed to protect against top down attack like the Javelin ATGM, which are now in use by #Ukraine’s armed forces:    
@ChristopherJM Fortunately, there are many people in Ukraine who are against the war with #Russia, who sees total utopia even to consider a real war against Russia. Even with all the the help that current government of #Ukraine gets from US, EU, NATO, Ukraine won't be able to win that war.

Russian intelligence accuses U.S. of provoking escalation in ##Donbas  #Ukraine #Russia   
#Russia - #Ukraine war drums. Now the IMF has given money to Ukraine.. Matthew 24:6 - Rumors of Wars 
@andersostlund I’ve always said #Ukraine needs a lightening action to reclaim its occupied territory  Without direct Russian intervention, ahem, #Donbas will be liberated  No negotiations w/ the #Kremlin regime – Just like there wasn’t w/ the Belgrade regime  To them, that signifies weakness 
Continuing contacts between Washington and Moscow are intended to dial back the tensions and perhaps attempt to use June’s summit between Biden and Putin as a stepping stone toward some form of actual progress. #IntelBrief #Russia #Ukraine
@irinatsukerman_ why ? isn’t the land they have not enough for Russians ? every year citizens leave the country , isn’t that absurd that Russia still wants extra land ? for what you have land but u don’t know how to build on it ,make people’s welfare good and still another land? Leave #Ukraine!
