#France and its President #Macron tells #Putin and #Russia they will help defend #Ukraine from any #Russian hostility, time for other #Nato Allies to step up as well!!! 
Current events are a clear example of the multiplicity of #security threats facing UK, Europe and US. As UK raises its natl #terror threat level to Severe, Russian troops are massing on #Ukraine border and China warns US to drop support for #Taiwan.

It's not abnormal to see the RAF's 146's flying from Kyiv to London and back, however it's not usually at this time of night. Thats a late flight for a diplomat to be taking. #ADSB #Ukraine 
Yes, @BorisJohnson is absolutely right: ‘I hope...other European countries may recognise, that a choice is shortly coming, between mainlining ever more Russian hydrocarbons in giant new pipelines, and sticking up for #Ukraine’... #Germany? 
@tashecon Such ignorance of #Ukraine is striking. In fact, there is civil war in #Donbas, most Ukrainians are unwilling to fight in this war, Ukraine is largely undemocratic, values in Ukraine are similar to #Russia. Ukrainians deserve Western support for peace, human rights &amp; democracy.

I was just sent an abstract of someone’s Doctorate dissertation about #Russia’s war against #Ukraine in Donbas.   The title mentioned “Donbass war”.   Couldn’t restrain myself from messaging this person, whose defence is tomorrow, to explain how to transliterate Ukrainian.
Putin once said the breakup of the USSR was the "greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century."   This enduring nostalgia has a strategic rationale behind it. Russia's policy toward #Ukraine is not likely to change in a post-Putin generation.  
These two municipalities are extremely creative, active, experienced in project management and eager to cooperate with each other in a number of areas. +1 to the bridges between #Ukraine and #Latvia.  #BridgesofTrust, @CCRECEMR, @Platforma4Dev

So,@EmmanuelMacron tells #Putin that #France is ready to defend #Ukraine's "territorial integrity". Hope the French are informed that that's the deal. But, I guess, in this case what matters more to Macron is that Americans are informed.

With Russia amassing its military at the Ukrainian border, there is a real threat of further destabilization in the region. Threat to life and livelihood for innocent Ukrainians. Democracy must be protected and tyranny stopped. Pay attention. #Ukraine #Russia #HumanRights
Head of #Ukraine's #Naftogaz: We're ready to present arguments why the Nord Stream 2 pipeline can't become operational without full conformity with European energy law. #XGlobalMarkets #NordStream2 #OOTT

To those convinced that inter-state warfare is a thing of the past, I am here to remind you it is very much still a reality. If you think Russia is not capable of an invasion let me remind you of what happened in 2014 in Crimea. #HumanRights #Ukraine #Russia
#Stoltenberg admits they don't have any evidence to back up their "#Russia imminent (or whenever) invasion of #Ukraine" claims 😎  #NATO #Warfare disinformation playbook

Foreign Ministers of #Germany and #France in a joint statement called on #Russia to show restraint in the issue of maneuvers near the borders of #Ukraine.  They also called on Ukraine for restraint and implementation of the Minsk agreements.
Boy, that was not a flattering interview even if confirmed nothing that we did not already know about why #Ukraine is not in #NATO.  To be fair, it also demonstrates why Kyiv is so frustrated with the West. 
After meeting @DmytroKuleba today @HeikoMaas and @JY_LeDrian declared their countries’ unwavering support for the independence, sovereignty &amp; territorial integrity of #Ukraine. Attempts to undermine UA territorial integrity would have serious consequences.

#RUSSIA warns relation w/West “almost at boiling point” as tensions mount at #Poland-#Belarus border. Putin said he would “simply destroy” any country that encroached on Russian territory #LittleGreenMen #Nato #Ukraine #Lithuania #Romania #UK #USA #Germany 
"Thousands of Russian troops - including elite units - have been amassing near the Ukrainian border in recent weeks, according to satellite photos, with high-tech military equipment also being deployed in the area near the breakaway Donbass region...."  #Ukraine
@Angry_Staffer I'm a very angry Ukrainian-American who's EXTREMELY frustrated with Biden's non-response to escalated #ruSSian threats to #Ukraine. #Ukraine must be invited into #NATO now, mil aid sent, complete embargo/blockade, &amp; #StopNordStream2 are logical steps. WHY won't Biden take them?!
Thank you, #Poland 🇵🇱, #Ukraine 🇺🇦, #Lithuania 🇱🇹 (my home country) and #Latvia 🇱🇻 for denying access to these so-called "refugees" from the Middle East. They're not refugees at all - they're just economic migrants who want to live off a European taxpayer's money. (1/2)
