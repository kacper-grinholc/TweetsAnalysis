Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said on Wednesday that Russia’s intentions behind its latest #military buildup along #Ukraine’s eastern border were unclear, but that Moscow would be making a “serious mistake” by committing new aggression against its embattled neighbor. NYT

@EndGameWW3 Watch for provocations amongst Russian diaspora in Baltics, Poland and Ukraine.  I don't think Putin will take on NATO, and chances are Putin will rattle #Ukraine #Zelensky and back down. Putin prefers a friendly govt change/coup in Ukraine, but time may be up....
My guess is #Russia’s posturing on #Ukraine’s has to do with US navy traversing the Black Sea recently.

"The Kremlin is putting all of its resources into making sure democracy in Ukraine fails." 🇺🇦  @O__Honcharuk discusses the political, social and cultural pressures #Ukraine faces as the crossroads between liberal democracy and authoritarianism in Europe. 
Important and positive news. For #Ukraine #USA and the whole community of free countries. But one has to be prepared for severe, externally engineered tests of this partnership - from those who find this Charter an obstacle for their plans or a threat to their interests. 
I agree with @florian_krammer #COVID19 in #Europe is extremely concerning - especially #Romania, #Bulgaira, #Ukraine, #UK, #Germany and many others.  In the past week Europe has accounted for 63.1% new cases and they continue to increase leading to pressure on hospitals. 
#Ukraine continues to have a major surge of #covid19 cases. More than 23,000 new cases were detected today. 815 people have died within 24 hours due to #coronavirus. #Zelensky government vowed to vaccinated 70% of Ukrainians by August of 2021. So far only 18% are #FULLYvaccinated

My biggest concern is that the troop movements towards the border of #Ukraine in spring 2021 were part of a larger plan. Yes, they should intimidate Kiev. Maybe enable #Russia to take by force what it could’nt achieve by proxies yet. But what if it opens up additions options?
4/ In my opinion #Putin has decided to draw a line in #Belarus. He has lost #Ukraine from the #Russia|n sphere of influence. He seems adamant not to repeat the same with Minsk. The secret meetings with Lukashenko earlier probably have decided the next steps in #Putin|s plan.
3/ While #Putin probably want to avoid an unlimited conflict it seems that the window for diplomatic solutions has been closed. #Russia feels encircled and it will try everything to destabilize NATO countries. It also pursues its own goals in the #Ukraine .

Coming back from Moscow, where I had intensive talks w/ Oleg Tyapkin and Aleksey Polishchuk of @mfa_russia, and Pavel Savalny of @dumagovru on topics like #Belarus, #Ukraine, #N4, #Energy, #NGOs and the future of the Petersburg Dialogue, 🇩🇪-🇷🇺 relations. 
Outrage grows in #Ukraine as this #Germany politician apparently calls for "rerouting to #Ukraine" some of the #migrants that are being herded into invading the #EuropeanUnion through the #BelarusBorder, while (apparently) attacking #Poland for defending herself. 
Ms.Olha RABIICHUK, Head,Project Management Dept, State Agency for #Tourism Development of #Ukraine, highlighted the Agency's close work with local communities to create🇺🇦destinations, focused on the 4 key areas for its activities,&amp; described challenges for tourism during #COVID19 
#Blinken, Kuleba to discuss #Russia's actions on #Ukraine's border
Head of the Committee on Budget Yuri Aristov met with the representatives of the @WorldBank in #Ukraine. Emphasis was placed on the framework program of cooperation with 🇺🇦 for 2022-2025 "Support for the development and prosperity of Ukraine." 
We need to stop looking at the #BelarusBorder #Ukraine and #Bosnia as separate events. Vučić, Putin, and Orban have been meeting with Lukashenko and Dodik and pulling the strings in a not so subtle manner. #WesternBalkans #EasternEurope
Government resumes work of the Energy Company of Ukraine - @Denys_Shmyhal   Details:  #Ukraine #Kabmin #Energy 
This is quite a credible source I believe. A diversion op to destabilise Europe and facilitate a strike on #Ukraine which will involve wars in Kosovo and BiH is unfolding before our eyes.

Imagine how powerful a visit by #Starmer would be now exposing the vacuity of Boris's politics and showing what the UK could offer and his criticism might spur the govt into some action which, God knows, is needed to avert war in #BiH, #Kosovo and #Ukraine #FBPE 
Why #Russia is pushing for a new round of aggression against #Ukraine

#Ukraine: Threats to press freedom? #CFWIJ stands in solidarity with the @KyivPost newsroom as owner #AdnanKivan fires "inconvenient" journalists &amp; abruptly suspends operations. At least 29 women among more than 50 journalists dismissed without notice.  ➡️ 
So far #Ukraine #Afghanistan #Armenia #Azerbaijan #Austria have made recommendations to #Ireland on ratification of #OPCAT. These countries have ratified this imp treaty designed to prevent torture and ill-treatment in detention. Ireland hasn't. #UPR39 @UPRinfo @IPRT @ICCLtweet
Sorry to see that @KyivPost  will be closed as it was one of my top choices to better understand #Ukraine . The variety of views and the bright and clear commentary were insightful as useful.

🇷🇺 #RussiaMonitor #Russia is whipping up tensions in relations with #Ukraine. Perhaps it is incidental that Vladimir #Putin’s visit to Crimea coincided with reports of an alleged Russian military buildup at the border with Ukraine.  
💭 #Ukraine plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 65% until 2030 and to achieve #climate neutrality by 2060, President @ZelenskyyUa said, @UATV_en reports:

I'm a human rights journalist. Within the past 3 weeks, I documented 3 humanitarian tragedies unfolding in Europe: migrants freezing to death at #Poland #Belarus border; elderly people &amp; desperate families who remain living in destroyed houses in eastern #Ukraine's war zone [1/3]
We stand in solidarity with the #KyivPost employees, after the #shutdown of #Ukraine's oldest English-language newspaper and largest independent newspaper in an obvious attack on #independentjournalism and #pressfreedom. 
In January-September 2021, the average monthly salary in the Ukrainian agricultural sector grew by 18% compared to the same period last year, according to the @MinistryAPK  #Ukraine #новини    
A controversial suggestion from @NilsSchmid, of the likely leading party in Germany’s next government, the SPD: Migrants on the Polish border could be processed in #Ukraine. Audacious, even, given Germany’s current standing in Ukraine due to #NordStream2

Prominent linguist Orest Tkachenko has died in Ukraine at the age of 96. He is known for his studies of Finno-Ugric languages: "Meryan language" (1985), "Essays on the theory of language substrate" (1989) etc. #Ukraine #Ukrainians 
Yes, this is my feeling too, it's possible this is a plan. That said it may be a disastrous plan obviously for #Ukraine above all, but ultimately for Russia and Putin. But, again on a personal note, I feel such anger at the way Ukrainians have been left to fight this battle. 
#Ukraine's govt dismissed Mykola Chechotkin as head of the State Emergency Service. Rivne department head Serhiy Kruk has been appointed acting head of the agency, according to the Cabinet rep in the Rada. Chechotkin had been in office for more than 6 years - from May 14, 2015.

This is #Video appendix E of my paper on revelations from #Maidan massacre trials &amp; investigations in #Ukraine. It was presented at 10 World Congress of International Council for Central and East European Studies at Concordia University in August 2021. 
Stakes are high as #Ukraine has to simultaneously maintain focus on democratic transformation, reforms, and defense. #Kyiv is not alone in facing such hurdles.
#Ukraine 🇺🇦approached a crucial moment in its #reforms and is signing a new strategic document with the United States 🇺🇸, while Russia 🇷🇺 is secretly deploying elite troops at its border.
