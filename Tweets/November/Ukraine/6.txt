2001 NATO    “It is possible that a military rival may emerge in Asia with a formidable resource base. US armed forces must maintain their capabilities to impose the US’s will on any adversary,..''  USA and NATO have tried to make the #Ukraine crisis explode...  Manlio Dinucci
@I_Katchanovski What a waste of #US #taxpayers $ by sending #CIA director to #Russia just to "warn" Russia over troop buildup 250 miles away from #Ukraine's border. What a nonsense. Russia, Ukraine, US has a full right to rotate own troops within own borders. Nobody can dictate what to do.
#US President #JoeBiden dispatched #CIA Director #BillBurns to #Moscow earlier this week to warn the #Kremlin that the US is watching its buildup of troops near #Ukraine's border closely. #Russia #WhiteHouse #Kiev #Washington

#pt: "Assessments on #Russia's motives differ widely within the administration, with some sources telling CNN they believe Russia could be preparing for an invasion [of #Ukraine], while others suggest they are conducting an exercise, or simply trying to intimidate Ukraine."
Sending CIA Director Bill Burns to Moscow "underscores how seriously the Biden administration is taking the latest #Russian troop movements [near #Ukraine], even after an earlier buildup in the spring ultimately did not lead to a renewed invasion." 
There's story behind this story, present beneath the surface of several vignettes: failures of the healthcare system in #Ukraine and #COVID19 vaccine skepticism even among some medical workers.

A good infographic on #Ukraine: length of service by PM, defence, interior and healthcare ministers.  Since independence in 1991, an average PM stayed in their job for 1 year and 7 months. 
In #Ukraine, on Thursday 4 November, there was a reshuffle of the cabinet, with 5 new ministers appointed. A good overview by @IAPonomarenko &amp; @mrsorokaa  here: 
"We also need a strong blockade of #Russia ❕and #Belarus by EU countries, because all this destabilization of Europe and our region is aimed at distracting attention from what is happening in #Ukraine or the #MiddleEast", added General Polko.

Republicans always ready for war!  #Ukraine 
CIA Director Burns was sent to #Russia's capital #Moscow to warn against troop buildup near #Ukraine's border, officials say.  ▪️Russia has increased its troop presence at the border. ▪️"The buildup does suggest a more aggressive Russian posture," an adviser to Zelensky told CNN. 
It is reported that #Ukraine began to import electricity from #Belarus. I understand that this is done to plug an energy deficit caused by coal shortages but I hope that an alternative way could be found. It is crucial not to support the regime in Minsk by buying from it
