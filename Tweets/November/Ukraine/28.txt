@EddieHearn Ling of #Australia huh?  Stop it you know you opened that market up. Same with the #Mexico market, and #Ukraine  Only way to create interest. Genius.  $$$$$ #PPV lol More like free fights coming soon. Your sponsors should pay .
No doubt also remains the fact that #Putin still wants to realize his morbid concept of #Russky mir What is certain is that #war in #Ukraine is just the beginning The dream of adding a #Soviet bloc is the biggest threat not only to #Poland #Lithuania #Latvia #Estonia and #Finland
I am sure that #America will treat #Kurds the same way it treats #Ukraine because it only joins the #war when all the cards are on the table. And I have a feeling that when #Russia moves, #China will also move on #Taiwan Then the #US and #Biden will be cornered.
#Ukraine Army have started a large exercise near Odessa to prepare for potential assaults on its borders. #Russia 📸 
What triggered #tension between #Ukraine and #Russia? 
@FranticGoat Yes. #Kyiv shouldn't labor under the delusion that #Russia would sit idly by as TB2s plink "separatist" positions, because (im)plausible deniability is sacrosanct to #Moscow .   #Ukraine #Donbas #Putin #Kremlin  CC @jeff_hawn @KofmanMichael @RALee85 @Jack_Watling
