And nominations through Yamal-Europe will max out bookings, which are only about 1/3 of capacity. It looks like @Gazprom prefers #gas transit through #Ukraine over #Poland, at least when it doesn't have to pay for more at the Ukraine-#Russia border 
@AvgerinosMoscow #Ukraine I wonder if #USA “misunderstood”, #Russia honoring their long-term contract re: transit fees, worth $3 billion, as #Russian #Aggression! Especially as #Putin said “we will pay our #Ukrainian brothers, and hope they come to their senses”.
On Russian escalation towards #Ukraine: To quote Chekhov: “If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise, don't put it there.” ...the gun needs to be taken down from the wall. #OSCE2021SWE
