Ask any @CIA Russia desk analyst,they'll tell you '#Ukraine in NATO' is a redline no Russian president would tolerate (except if Khodorkovsky was president).Things get serious, bad time to play dumb. PS If there's indeed "the blind spot" - ? is what billion $ budget wasted on?
@Echo5India @BlueMage19 @RALee85 From a #Russia|n perspective there might be a security issue involved: if #Ukraine moves closer to NATO and allows deployment of foreign troops and aircrafts it‘s what Putin defines as a red line. It might be worth for Russia to wage war now rather than later.
United as one against in reaching the same goals and the persistent common enemy of #RUSSIA who just can't let go of the past. AND IS DOOMED TO KEEP REPEATING IT.  It's time to get off to crazy bus.  THIS IS #UKRAINE'S FUTURE  UNITED FOR FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY.

I read the title &amp; thought #US was just playing fool.Then I watched @CNN asking abt "#Putin's motives for invading #Ukraine" &amp; heard the answers such as "further dispution of #NATO" &amp; "..constantly testing the West". I know see why the "blind spot"

@McFaul The #Us is snoozing while #Putin is invading #Ukraine…do you think he’ll stop there?
@AlexKokcharov @TatAtfender Yes absolutely. However Putin made it clear this week that Russia sees it as provocation. My point stands: ppl have to be v careful about selling arms to #Ukraine.   Basically: be smart. Don’t do it just to make money.

@m15992576 Why did #Russia invade / attack #Ukraine? This is a fact. Like #Crimea And #MH17 AND  #Salisbury murder.
With some 100,000 Russian troops now massed on #Ukraine's eastern border, the #Biden administration may providing #Kyiv with battlefield intelligence. #NATO #Russia #Military
#Putin needs a land bridge to #Crimea. He's running the same play that worked in 2014. He'll send in "humanitarian" trucks full of troops and materiel, then Russian soldiers "on vacation", and he'll trust that no one will do anything about it until he controls more of #Ukraine. 
@SBSNews Same scene was peaceful demonstration in late 2013 in #Ukraine, so what's the difference?

Yes, we can. It's far too easy: no, #Russia is not going to invade #Ukraine or take #Donbass. That's it, they'd be happy with a semi-legit fulfilment of #Minsk. But Ukraine and allies aren't willing to even pretend anymore. 
@APHClarkson @KadriLiik His essay #Ukraine was just standard Russian chauvinist rabid mouthfoam- it's quite worrying that this is part of his motivation and has informed his comments on #Ukraine over many years of Ukraine is not a state to Bush. That is as close as he comes to a plan.
The US cannot save #Ukraine. But it can give #Poland the tools it needs to deter #Russia from attempting to lay claim to all of Easter Europe.

Think of #Russia coordinating with #China and at the very same time Russia goes into #Ukraine and #China invades #Taiwan because #Europe is weak and the #USA is far away and not ready to deal with two military crises at the same time.
#Ukraine is prepared:   
Separatist #Abkhazia's new foreign minister is on #Ukraine's wanted list. He was accused in 2015 of leading efforts to undermine the country's territorial integrity, namely plans to construct a breakaway entity of "Bessarabia" in the Odessa area.
#MichaelKofman says "#Russia/n military movements could be preparation for action sometime early next year." If it is not so immediate, is #Putin preparing for something bigger than invasion in #Ukraine?

#UPDATE US Secretary of State Antony #Blinken on Saturday repeated that his country has "real concerns" about Russia's "unusual military activity" on the border with #Ukraine and "some of the rhetoric"  
Kazansky comes to the necessary conclusions: - the 2014 #Ukraine revolution had serious, but now mostly forgotten, ECONOMIC reasons along the main ones (corruption &amp; police brutality) - #Russia abused the 2012-2013 economic troubles for forcing Yanukovych into her "Union"

Interesting #FactCheck by Donbas journo @den_kazansky: were President Yanukovych &amp; his PM Azarov (both Donbasians now hiding in RU) good at #Ukraine economy in 2010-2013? Answer: "no, regardless of the [2014 revolution]"; "it was a ship heading for rocks".
Tatar communities live under horrible racist pressure. Now is a first time after WW2, when Polish Tatars are reminded for something positive. And all they had Nobility from king Sobiesky, after war with Turkey. Europe is dying because of its own racism. #Ukraine #eu #ww3 #Russia 
Please, we need views, likes and subscriptions. We need to help @GlasnostGone pass the information on how much deceiving Russian occupation forces are in Eastern #Ukraine. The suffering they cause over 7+ years is appalling. #Donbas #Donbass
Your daily reminder that #RussiaInvadedUkraine , annexed #Crimea , still occupies part of Eastern #Ukraine and still wages war on Ukraine  #RussiaIsATerroristState  How Russia's Forces Disguise MLRS in Ukraine  via @YouTube

#Russia cannot be a partner for peace in #Ukraine. #Putin is a perpetrator of violence. 
A better way than #capitulation: #NATO-stand up to #Putin's disregard 4 international law!  #US &amp; other friends of #Ukraine &amp; democracy increase #Putin's pain: Get #Russia out of#SWIFT; freeze #Russian assets in #West.   Get tougher not meeker! 7 yrs of pusssyfooting has FAILED! 
@InfluencePoint @Mortis_Banned @Kir_the_Wizard While in the UK any high placed agents cannot openly slobby against the MoD supporting #Ukraine- indeed they might even have to appear to welcome it  - Putin may not be as brilliant as he thinks.

#Ukraine in WW2 faced multiple enemies UNDER THE NAZI HEEL  
Journos willing to do journalism about #Russia's interference in US could simply investigate personal wealth and financial transactions of certain two Washington "think tanks" currently involved in the massive propaganda of "flexibility" and "forcing" #Ukraine into Minsk "peace".
#Ukraine #NATO is a toothless crack whore that can be led around by the nose looking for their next fix. Do not trust it.
For my Ukrainian friends, I am concerned that should the little green men cross the border, the majority of the world’s leaders will say angry things at the lectern and do nothing.  #Ukraine #Poland #Belarus   This will not end well.

It's like playing hide-and-seek with my 4 year old. I am allowed to look everywhere except where she doesn't want me to. And much like my 4 year old, not meeting demands can end in a hissy fit. #Russia #Donbas #Ukraine 
Here’s something interesting and unexpected. #Ukraine is using #Turkish drones in its war against Russian-backed separatists. Surprise, Mr. #Putin! Things are getting messy.  
Russia is an occupant. I am from Georgia and My country is occupied by Russia. Russia is the enemy of civilized and democratic world. Russia is a dangerous and criminal country in the world. Russia is killing.  #europe #world #global #us #democracy #Ukraine #Ukrainian #Ukrainians

@RikardJozwiak What alternatives do you propose? #BANruSSiaFromSWIFT, embargo #ruSSia, admit #Ukraine to #NATO, #StopNordStream2, are good ways to start deterring mass-murderer #putin.
Russian hybrid forces launched 17 (!) attacks with the use of hard 152-mm and 122-mm artillery in 14 settlements in the #war zone in E #Ukraine. 1 KIA among UA troops - official:  | EMPR 
Signs on the #Ukraine border that #Russia is preparing for a major offensive Thread. 
@Kir_the_Wizard @InfluencePoint @Mortis_Banned I think it's different to Afghanistan in so many ways- - and there is strong bipartisan support for #Ukraine In any case the internal Ukrainian dimension means it's impossible as @Mortis_Banned said

Have you ever heard of Vinnytsia, Ukraine? It's a fantastic option for a weekend escape from Kiev or a stop on your Eastern Europe backpacking trip. #ukraine #europe #travel #backpacking 
@Cosmopolitka @SaakashviliM Mishiko will only spill the beans in respect of his own &amp; #US's criminality in #Ukraine throughout 2013-2014 - &amp; ever since, provided he is guaranteed Asylum in (both) Georgia &amp; throughout Russian Federation accompanied by a fat bank a/c in Cayman Islands &amp; a villa in Sochi!

Harsh words. However, consider what these people, in their air conditioned offices typing at their mac computers are advocating. That a dictator who has butchered vast numbers of people be allowed to subjugate a democratic country. Chamberlain's children. #Ukraine
