I have never seen so many disinformation campaigns rolling at one time before.   For reference, all out information warfare looks like "5k retweets" and replies like "damn, this is exciting!".  #Ukraine #Russia #Donbass
"Citing #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine and occupation of Crimea, Schiff said that without stronger international deterrence, '#China and Russia will feel that in this century, it is once again permissible to remake the map of the world by dint of military force.'"

🇺🇦⚡The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine has accepted the resignation of the Minister of Defense Andriy Taran.  #Ukraine
The Biden Administration needs to formulate a plan to counter the buildup of #Russian troops &amp; military equipment on #Ukraine’s border. This is increasingly concerning.  My full statement: 
Your daily reminder that #RussiaInvadedUkraine , annexed #Crimea , still occupies part of Eastern #Ukraine and still wages war on #Ukraine  #RussiaIsATerroristState #CrimeaIsNotRussia  #CrimeaIsUkraine 🇺🇦  #UkraineIsEurope 🇪🇺

I think what we have here are disinformation psy-ops by Putin &amp; Co. - Leads “us” to create hype &amp; builds tension which in turn creates manipulation mechanisms for Kremlin gremlins to leverage against the West. - In essence, they are trolling the intl community. #Ukraine #Donbass 
I have been personally told by some in Russia that their relatives serving as Russian Army regulars were deployed to #Crimea in February 2014, when #Putin gave the order to seize all of #Ukraine.   2/
Significant Russian movement on #Ukraine border, but not overtly aggressive- U.S. general 
FM Lavrov was too diplomatic. It is the US/Brits pushing #Ukraine towards the military conflict in Donbass in hopes to get Russia involved. They d then cry "wolf" and "Russian aggression". Recall Lloyd Oston's obnoxious remarks, British missiles, the US Warships in the Black sea. 
Could folks be distorting/misinterpreting things a bit? 🤔 - The “F O R M E R” Dep Chief of Gen Staff said this.... #Ukraine #Donbass

#Russia has left servicemen numbering close to 100,000 near its border with #Ukraine, heightening tensions after the recent military drills in the region which alarmed western states. 
Do you still need more proof that #US using its puppet state called #Ukraine to fight 🇱🇷war on #Russia at 🇺🇦 expense?  
#Ukraine has denied reports that #Russia is massing troops and ramping up military equipment near the border, and Ukraine’s defense ministry confirmed the number of Russian troops that are left in the area is now totaling 90,000.

🪖 #US officials are closely monitoring #Russian #military activity near the border with #Ukraine, which has sparked concern about #Moscow’s intentions after months of escalating tensions between the 2 countries, @ForeignPolicy says:  
Dear International media: You are fueling the greatest lie ever told by the Kremlin. The entire war in Ukraine was started by Moscow, and continues to be led and financed by Moscow. How do we know for sure? Because they told us.  #ukraine #russia #Donbas

I hope he challenged the #Kremlin on its #hackers who still launch #Ransomware attacks on US companies, their persistent meddling in our elections, and the #satellite imagery of Russian armored units, soldiers and artillery nearing the #Ukraine border. 
Russian motives for not having completely cut Kiev off from energy supplies are clear. Moscow is not interested in fully disintegrating #Ukraine as a state, as this could only worsen the unstable situation near its western borders.
