Monday's call between @thejointstaff's Gen Milley &amp; #Ukraine's LtGen Zaluzhny is the 2nd such call in the past 4 days 
JUST IN: US-#Ukraine   @thejointstaff Chair Gen Mark Milley spoke by phone w/Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Lt. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny  They "exchanged perspectives &amp; assessments of the evolving security environment in Eastern Europe" per readout 
"#Russia preparing to attack #Ukraine by late January: Ukraine defense intelligence agency chief" @MilitaryTimes report:  
There are currently more than 94000 #Russian troops on the #Ukraine border, along with 1200 #tanks, #missile batteries, 330 #aircraft, 240 helicopters, 75 #warships, and 6 #submarines nearby.  #Putin has peaceful humanitarian reasons no doubt.  Sleep well, everybody. 
BTG's are agile, combined-arms formations within the Russian military with the highest rates of readiness. These formations would be the "first one in, last one out" during a kinetic conflict. The BTG concept proved itself fiercely capable in 2014 in the invasion of #Ukraine. 4/5
An indicator to track in the coming weeks for the likelihood of the Russian military initiating conflict is the prepositioning of #BattalionTacticalGroups (#BTG's) into the region. Some estimates put ~1/4 of all Russia's BTGs as currently near #Ukraine  3/5
many analysts view the likelihood of military conflict as unprecedently high this time.  üëâIt is important to note that the Russian military of 2021 is significantly more lethal than the Russian military of 2014, which illegally invaded #Ukraine and annexed #Crimea. 2/5
üö®It is important to call attention to the unprecedented Russian military build-up occurring right now near #Ukraine. Unlike the highly televised build-up in April 2021 - which many saw as Moscow posturing to extract concessions; 1/5 
However due to the Chernobyl disaster, Ukraine suspended construction. Currently Unit 3 is at 75% complete, Unit 4 is 28%.   #ukraine #westinghouse #nuclear #nuclearpower #energy #energoatom #ukilifeabroad

@scharap US and Europeans should then privately communicate that list to Moscow so that Kremlin has clear understanding of additional costs that #Russia will bear if it sends its military into #Ukraine. Goal should be to ensure Kremlin has full understanding of potential costs.
@scharap Correct on "to respect." My mistake.  Alternative is confirm with #Ukraine that accepting #Russia's interpretation of Minsk II is of no interest and work with Europe to put together strong list of sanctions (oligarchs, state enterprises, SWIFT).

The ongoing, vigorous, and sometimes bitter debates over the risk of a great power war in #Ukraine and #Taiwan , demonstrate the problem of determining intentions. We find capabilities and movements can be interpreted in different ways. There is also an Observer Effect in IR.
#Gravitas | Is #Russia preparing to invade #Ukraine? US intel suggests 100,000 troops have descended on Ukraine's border, they could cross into Ukraine by next year. Does this mean war is certain? @palkisu decodes the possibilities.  #Donbass #Kremlin 
Legislative impact assessment can improve the effectiveness of legislation, including gender aspects. @Parlcent and the #AgencyforLegislativeInitiatives are supporting the implementation of this practice in #Ukraine security sector legislation. @CanadaFP @CanadaDev

Maidan medic also tacitly admits in her recorded phone call that her neck surgery was misrepresented as her wounding during #Maidan massacre. This is consistent with her tweet before this massacre in #Ukraine that she was hospitalized with throat problems.

How long before #Russia invades and takes over the rest of #Ukraine? And during that reaction and distraction, does #China attempt to seize #Tawian? #Iran may also make moves vs #Israel? No better time than now with Biden in office and the US &amp; Europe look &amp; act weak.

Russian officials have called all of this "disinformation," and said Ukraine, backed by US and NATO, are the aggressors. Gaslight much, Russia? üö©üö©üö©   #Ukraine #Russia #redflag  
Deterrence is not just a military policy. If Biden is worried of #Russia|n aggression in #Ukraine but weary of sending troops, now is the time to deter Putin through both military and non-military actions. If the infosphere isn't tilted in Putin's favor, war becomes less likely.
