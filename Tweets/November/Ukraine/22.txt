JUST IN: US-#Ukraine   @thejointstaff Chair Gen Mark Milley spoke by phone w/Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Lt. Gen. Valery Zaluzhny  They "exchanged perspectives &amp; assessments of the evolving security environment in Eastern Europe" per readout 
"#Russia preparing to attack #Ukraine by late January: Ukraine defense intelligence agency chief" @MilitaryTimes report:  
There are currently more than 94000 #Russian troops on the #Ukraine border, along with 1200 #tanks, #missile batteries, 330 #aircraft, 240 helicopters, 75 #warships, and 6 #submarines nearby.  #Putin has peaceful humanitarian reasons no doubt.  Sleep well, everybody. 
BTG's are agile, combined-arms formations within the Russian military with the highest rates of readiness. These formations would be the "first one in, last one out" during a kinetic conflict. The BTG concept proved itself fiercely capable in 2014 in the invasion of #Ukraine. 4/5
An indicator to track in the coming weeks for the likelihood of the Russian military initiating conflict is the prepositioning of #BattalionTacticalGroups (#BTG's) into the region. Some estimates put ~1/4 of all Russia's BTGs as currently near #Ukraine  3/5
many analysts view the likelihood of military conflict as unprecedently high this time.  👉It is important to note that the Russian military of 2021 is significantly more lethal than the Russian military of 2014, which illegally invaded #Ukraine and annexed #Crimea. 2/5
🚨It is important to call attention to the unprecedented Russian military build-up occurring right now near #Ukraine. Unlike the highly televised build-up in April 2021 - which many saw as Moscow posturing to extract concessions; 1/5

Russia Rebuts Growing U.S. Warnings of Attack on #Ukraine - Nov 22 @ 2:46 PM ET 
@scharap US and Europeans should then privately communicate that list to Moscow so that Kremlin has clear understanding of additional costs that #Russia will bear if it sends its military into #Ukraine. Goal should be to ensure Kremlin has full understanding of potential costs.
@scharap Correct on "to respect." My mistake.  Alternative is confirm with #Ukraine that accepting #Russia's interpretation of Minsk II is of no interest and work with Europe to put together strong list of sanctions (oligarchs, state enterprises, SWIFT).
A US Congressional source familiar with the intelligence reporting told Reuters that Russia now had somewhere between 90,000 and 100,000 troops deployed near its border with #Ukraine. Putin's intentions are still unclear
