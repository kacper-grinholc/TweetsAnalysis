Room for improvement for press freedom in #Ukraine 
Yes we need both. Somehow the West is passive and indifferent. Letting it happen. Most importantly #Ukraine can't be dependent on others. Tired of the victim mentality. The "betrayals". When does anyone learn? Someone is benefiting in one way or another on the constant blunders. 
"The main goal is to restrain #Russia from further aggressive actions. To do this, #Moscow must clearly understand what political, economic and human losses it will incur in the event of a new stage of aggression" - #Ukraine's foreign minister
