@OscDomesticated This will not be the triumph he hopes for of course but whether that stops him is another question. I am not a detached observer of course #Ukraine but am trying to think it through weighing up what I know of him- and Russia
@IntelCrab #Putin will not telegraph an attack. It will come without any forewarning. There will be no national recalls, evacuations, or UN posturing unless he's simply using this as another grand bluff.   An expensive one at that.   #ukraine
According to 10 months results, #Ukrzaliznytsya became profitable  everything on track, no staff had to be fired to make this turnaround (except the highly stupid, corrupt and overcompensate former board members) 👍 #ukraine #andersaslund
What can be expected next? If a summit meeting really takes place #Russia will try to get in a strong position for any negotiations. The troop build-up at #Ukraine 's border certainly fits into the picture. 👇
With everything going on with the rumored buildup by #Russia  on the #Ukraine border in what some are calling a staging for an offensive, I would recommend those who may not understand the situation gain some historical perspective. I recommend reading: 
To deter Russian aggression, the international community must express urgent support for #Ukraine by statements as well as physical protection!  #Russia #agression
“As #coronavirus infections hit #Ukraine, a single shift for Dr.Molchanov now stretches to 42 hours. While #vaccination rates in Eastern #Europe have generally lagged, Ukraine has one of the lowest in the region.”

Each time when #Ukraine government facing civil unrest over falling living standards, sky rocketing utility tariffs, plunging approval rating of ruling party, it starts screaming about "#Russia invasion"  #BlameRussia 🙃 
Breaking ⚡️ The first combat use of Javelin in #Donbas  For the first time in the Donbas, the Ukrainian Armed Forces used the Javelin portable anti-tank missile system. Soon, modern Russian ATGM systems will appear in the hands of the Donbas Army. #Russia #Ukraine #Conflict

Question for military Twitter: If #Russia is planning to invade #Ukraine, wouldn't conventional wisdom dictate that they muster something like 3x the number of defending troops to ensure success? As far as I have seen, Ukraine can easily mobilize 300k, so Russia then needs 900k?

Protesters on Bankova in #Kiev announced an indefinite protest action on December 1, if #Zelensky does not fire the head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak, within 10 days: "Get too tired!" #ukraine

I read the book KGB, published 30 years ago, and it described how a careless risk-taker then KGB agent #Putin was, and the KGB brass didn't trust him- US intel and policy makers know this and are worried about a #Ukraine invasion.

@chrisalecanada @mccaffreyr3 @charlesadler It is not incorrect as some use 'The Ukraine' and others use #Ukraine. The name of my country is #Nederland. Should I be offended if you say #TheNetherlands? Of course not. Also: Russia did not colonize Ukraine. Ukraine was part of Russia proper (as in: Russian Empire). &gt;&gt;

Very insightful @getmalyona on #Ukraine foreign policy (and else) considerations under #Zelensky 
Russian Security Council  worried about a Ukrainian provocation in Crimea vicinity eg. they are trying to create atmosphere to set up staged pretext to attack #Ukraine or just increase tension  via @ukrpravda_news
Ultimately much will depend on whether #US considers #Ukraine as a part of it defense perimeter. And this is irrespective of Ukraine's #NATO membership chances.
@alsimplicio @fairleft @anders_aslund @HunterJCullen For sure. Crimea is a region of #Ukraine like #Kosovo is a province of Serbia. Indeed. But the Minsk Deal is about autonomy for Donetsk and Luhansk. So let's strike a deal there and move on.  #Kiev #Kyiv
MFA spox #Zakharova: While sabotaging implementation of #MinskAgreements, Ukrainian authorities are advancing initiatives and taking decisions without consulting #Donetsk and #Lugansk, which is further complicating the stalled settlement process in #Ukraine. 
WHILE THE WEST is consumed by #COVID19 case counting, the return of crippling inflation and rebuilding forgotten infrastructure — is #Russia planning to reinvade #Ukraine?

Are the #Ukraine hoping they can be fast tracked into @vonderleyen and @eucopresident accepting them into the #EU to ward if a fake @Russia invasion or war? A hybrid war is probably more effective for #Putin!
