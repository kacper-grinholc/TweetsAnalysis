This is a significant loss for #Ukraine watchers. Very, very disappointed to see @KyivPost closing its doors after nearly 3 decades of unmatched English-language reporting from #Ukraine.   My thoughts are with the remarkable journalists there who’ve kept a spotlight on #Ukraine. 
With the annexation and militarization of #Crimea, the occupation of #Ukraine's #Donbas, and the consistent build-up of troops near Ukraine's border, #Russia is once again radically changing the balance of power in #Europe by implementing a policy of aggression.

Terrible news that @KyivPost abruptly shut down today after 26 years in operation. Surely, something will arise in its ashes to serve the needs of expats, #Ukraine watchers. But in the meantime, many talented people out of work and important stories untold. 
Blames? Typical @Reuters sloppy biased reporting. #Belarus #Lukaszenka supported by #Putin is testing not #Polish but #EU &amp; #NATO defences &amp; solidarity.  The eastern Polish border is also the external EU/NATO border.  #Russia is flexing its muscle again. Like it did in #Ukraine. 
An incredibly sad development in #Ukraine 🇺🇦. @KyivPost was the best English-language news outlet in the country, I myself have been reading their articles ever since the #Euromaidan.  KyivPost was forced to shut down because it insisted on remaining an independent outlet.

More than 90 young climate activists from all corners of #Ukraine gather at "Energy of Changes" eco-forum in Poltava supported by UNICEF to drive dicsussions about #climatecrisis, strategise on #climateaction, generate ideas &amp; learn history of #climatechange movement  #COP26 
@museumofplay @Hasbro Did you induct the original Risk game, where #Ukraine is the prominent land or did you induct the "upgraded" version of Risk, where the ONLY change @Hasbro made is swapping Russia for Ukraine with no explanation, rhyme, or reason? 
And Put!n playing games with #Erdogan who supplied #Ukraine with armaments and killer drones used now in #Donbass to kill #Russians Who cares about ppl? Who cares about refugees? NO ONE! @UN @coe @Refugees 
@MichaelShurkin This is the ultimate question for NATO member nations. Why does it exist if not to provide overt support? #nato #Poland #Ukraine #Belarus #Russia
Very abrupt and shocking news from the @KyivPost. This is a huge loss for English-language coverage of #Ukraine. 
In #Donbas, Eastern #Ukraine, long gone from headlines, the conflict with Russian backed separatists rumbles on 
#photoart #Twitter #artcurator #citylife #artmonetization #naturallandscape #travel #Kyiv #Ukraine  Yesterday the weather was sunny and there were a lot of people here. Today, the Dnieper River is cool, but beautiful. This is a wonderful sky. Kiev. November 2021 
@USEmbassyKyiv It's high time we massively increase US aid to #Ukraine, the ONLY country fighting mass-murderer #putin FOR US!  For example, why does #Israel(pop. 8 M) get $5BILLION US taxpayer 💰 PER YEAR, even though they're &lt;1/5 pop. of 🇺🇦 &amp; not at war w/ ruSSia, the #1 terrorist state?
Clapper tells @jimsciutto the scale of #Russia's military buildup near #Ukraine is reminiscent of 2014, when Russia's "little green men" invaded Crimea. Biden dispatched CIA Dir Burns to Moscow to personally warn against another invasion if that's Russia's plan, Clapper suspects. 
#Putin sends #Biden warning as he flexes muscles with devastating show of force in #BlackSea #Russia #Ukraine 
Dreadfully sad to hear *the* English language news outlet in #Ukraine is closing.  I really hope it's not permanent

US law enforcement officials have seized $6 million in ransom payments, and the Justice Department is expected to announce it has charged a suspect from Ukraine over a July ransomware attack.  #UnitedStates | #Ukraine | #Ransomware
#Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Shinkovsky accused #Ukraine of #discrimination against Poles, specifying that the infringements relate to #religion and #education in their native #language. Similar accusations were made by #Russia, #Hungary.  Ukraine as usually denies it. #Poland
Ukrainian teachers will be dismissed fir not taking the vaccine. #COVID19 #Ukraine  
Vaccination center opens in Ukrainian Greek Catholic Cathedral in Kyiv.  #COVID19 #Ukraine 
Some schools across #Ukraine had switched to #distancelearning due to #covid19 #pandemic, but also because of lack of #heat inside the schools. In #Odessa, #Poltava regions it's too cold for students to study inside the schools since no heat was turned out for the winter yet.
Great news. Two American Island-class patrol boats are on their way to join #Ukraine's naval fleet. Boats part of a US security aid package worth more than $2.5 billion. In Baltimore, #Ukrainian naval crews have been training to use them &amp; now they get to sail them in Ukraine 😊 
#Ukraine recommends #AntiguaandBarbuda step up activities to address conditions of detention, consider ratifying OP-CAT @UKRinUNOG
There are many of these beautiful and magical pink lakes located around #Ukraine, and each has its own story and characteristics. What remains the same is that they all contain a unique #algae that creates the pink color. Ice creamOctopus | Photo: Jeka Loc #EastDeservesTheHype

Is @MFA_Ukraine actually allowing flights to/from #Belarus to through #Ukraine airspace? Only allows non-Belavia flights perhaps? 
We continue to enhance strategic #Interoperability and #partnership with #Ukraine. 🇺🇦🇺🇸🤝  #StrongerTogether 
An imminent Soviet un-charm offensive on FB? Why would Putin want the world to believe that it's actually kinda cool that #Russia's invading #Ukraine? Whatever the reason for Burns' involvement, it's intel-based, and outside the purview of #Blinken and the State Department. #CIA

The boats will be the latest addition to the Ukrainian Navy. The vessels should help strengthen #Ukraine's maritime security and increase the interoperability of Ukraine's navy with NATO, the embassy stated in a message. Another two Island Class boats have been in use since 2018.
