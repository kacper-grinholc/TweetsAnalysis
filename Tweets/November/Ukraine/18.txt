Kudos to @POTUS  and #Merkel who effectively managed to temporarily stop the activation of the #nord2 pipeline linking German (&amp; European markets with Russian natural gas) in retaliation for Russian invasion attempt of #Ukraine &amp; Russkie #ASAT test. Will this last, though?
@Fannycant #Donetsk is the capital of the Anti-#Ukraine breakaway Donetsk People's Republic. Ukraine &amp; #DPR have been at war for over 7 years. It is clear this is an attack by Ukraine
I think I may be wrong it is starting to look sinister #Ukraine 
@BernieSanders Hey numb nuts...you do know that our enemy #China has a hypersonic middle capability we can't defend against and #Russia is building up to invade #ukraine?  Like it or not we have to protect ourselves and our allies
@FortressEvropa Afghans might try to travel through Central Asia into Russia and then maybe enter #Ukraine and try to reach Slovakia or Romania...  ( #Belarus #Poland )
I think the  casus belli when and if it comes will be unmistakable. #Ukraine

#Russia, of course, never admitted to using blinding lasers (or waging the #Donbas war whatsoever). However, #Ukraine claims of such use have been reported as credible by #OSCE. A hard indirect proof is the official, open use of #laser weapons by RU domestic services. 5/5
Use of blinding #laser is, of course, a #warcrime prohibited by the 1995 Unusual and Non-Selective Weapons Treaty, to which #Russia is a signatory. And yet she's repeatedly used such weapons: lasers ag #Ukraine; [allegedly] "Cuba Syndrome" ultrasound weapons ag. US diplomats. 4/5
Technically, "Armiya-Inform" writes, the blinding weapon used is a unit of TWO lasers: the "low-energy" #laser constantly scans target area to detect enemy's (#Ukraine's) binoculars etc., upon which the HIGH-energy blinding beam burst-flashes at the detected optical piece. 3/5
Acc. to the named #Ophthalmology MDs, this is latest of the 15 cases ❗ of #Ukraine soldiers being blinded by enemy in #Donbas; all laser-attacked servicemen required prolonged treatment &amp; got permanent retina damage; one soldier was left without central eyesight for life. 2/5
BRKNG: #Russia army used blinding lasers against #Ukraine troops in #Donbas AGAIN, "a short time ago": UA mil. media citing a soldier undergoing treatment after an "abrupt flash" partially blinded him; his doctors at military and civilian hospitals.  1/5
