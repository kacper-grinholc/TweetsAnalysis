Also #Ethiopeans to me, (As Africans), Are Tolerable, because many of them are Quite Smart, (Smarter than most Sub-Saharan Africans), their Airlines is the Best, &amp; Many are Also Bilingual, in Both their Own Language &amp; also #Hebrew, Due to the Large Expat Community in #Israel too!

&amp; the reason that I said that I like Black Women more, (If East African's are Included), Is Due Mostly to my friend Aliza, (Who's #Ethiopian but Moved to #Israel), She Used to Work @ a Kiosk in a Mall in the City that I Live in, but She Moved to #Israel, She was Gorgeous. 🤔🙁😔

If one needed any further evidence the UK made the right choice to seek to ban Hamas and label it a terrorist group, one had only to pay attention to what took place in Jerusalem’s Old City.  Editorial | #Hamas | #Israel | #Terrorist | #Jerusalem  
for Saudi Arabia. #Ansarullah considers “clearly they believe their battle against Saudi Arabia is part of their overall war on #Israel and the #US. #Marib is merely a stepping stone”. #Riyadh faces a regional array of threats extending thousands of kilometers from #Yemen  1/7

#Israel-i police kill one Palestinian assailant he killed one Israeli and wounded four others. #Hamas claims responsibility for #Jerusalem shooting
The @tdsb is in the midst of irretrievably losing its way. #Islamophobia is feared if this #Yazidi activist is allowed to speak of her sexual slavery at the hands of #ISIS. #DesmondCole was paid great money to speak, quickly veering off into anti-#Israel &amp; #antisemitic tropes. 
The notion of term limits is vital for Israel’s democracy to ensure that no one person holds too much power, to encourage competitiveness, to reduce corruption, and to allow new blood to flow into the political system.  Opinion | #Israel | #Democracy 
Saudi Arabia has to cover politically and financially this war. As for its consequences, they are issues that do not fall within its jurisdiction. There are international bodies that ‘command’ the war, led by the #US and #Israel. This fact was revealed a few days ago by the 1/5

Senseless killing of a young Israeli! May his memory forever be a blessing! #Israel 🇺🇸🇮🇱 
Last week Knesset Speaker @MKMickeyLevy decided that he had enough, that it was time to appoint the Ethics Committee for Knesset members. But can it deal with the unacceptable actions of people like @dudiamsalem?  Opinion | #Israel 
#WriteforRights: 15-year-old Janna Jihad faces death threats &amp; intimidation for her work speaking up for human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Call on #Israel to end discrimination against her &amp; ensure her protection #W4R21  &gt;&gt;&gt;  
Even without access to Israel’s classified evidence about the PFLP, donor governments should have long ago opened investigations into the NGOs based on the public, independently verifiable information alone.  Opinion | #Israel | #Palestinian | #Terrorist  
The Nazis’ long term goal is to destroy Israel.   Hamas gunman kills 1 before Israeli police shoot him dead | Taiwan News | 2021-11-22 00:43:35 #Israel 
On everything from China, US Jewry, the Iran nuclear deal and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, readers of The Jerusalem Post have their say.  #Israel | #Palestinians | #China | #Iranian  
#Israel Prime Minister @naftalibennett ordered a heightened alert level in and around Jerusalem to prevent possible terrorist acts after a shooting resulted in one dead and several injured. 
Former head of #Mossad, Yossi Cohen: #Iran has been enriching more uranium since former President Trump. I think #Israel should have the ability to fight this aspect alone, like we did twice in the past in #Iraq and #Syria. 
When #Israel designated humanitarian NGOs as terrorist, and fiercely fights @BDSmovement while continously violating Palestinians rights, they left no choice but for armed resistance and thus Israel takes full responsibility for the killing of their subject ...
Everything they do is deliberate, but they will still play the victim because if you dare disagree with their ideology, the “anti-Semitic” tactic comes out. If you’re going to commit #CrimesAgainstHumanity, be ready to be called out on it. Don’t deflect, own up to it, #Israel 🤷🏻‍♀️

@harmlesstreeguy @pritipatel The only obstacle to peace in the middle east is hate.  Until the Mosques are cleansed from this filth, there will never be peace.  If you truly support Palestinian Arabs but refuse to acknowledge the root cause, you ARE the problem.  #Israel #Hamas
