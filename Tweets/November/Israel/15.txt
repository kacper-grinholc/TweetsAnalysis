#Israel's Defense Minister Benny Gantz @gantzbe will make an official visit next week to #Morocco. 
Great introductory call with @yairlapid, FM of #Israel. We discussed ways to strengthen the strong 🇨🇦🇮🇱 bilateral &amp; international partnerships.    We also discussed the need to combat the alarming rise of #antisemitism as well as the need for a lasting peace in the #MiddleEast. 
The @StateDept says Malley's trip to #Israel was "excellent" but lots of chatter in Israeli media today painting a more complicated picture with an unnamed Israeli diplomatic source telling @Jerusalem_Post, "we have no desire to legitimize a process that is very, very wrong." 
#Israel worried as cooperation between #Iran and #Turkey strengthens. 
State of play in 2021 is unless you blindly support #Israel and it’s horrific #Apartheid policies and continuing war crimes, and their political agents throughout the west lobbying to marginalise Muslim peoples, then YOU are an antisemite…. Funny that…   #ApartheidIsrael #BDS 
@KhaledAbuToameh he means #antisemitebrotherhood city.  since #Israel was Palestine by BritishM till Palestine existed by Arab-West conspiracy; #Jerusalem must for 3; #Jews must willing to coexist, all is their work! Israel best ally is the pioneers &amp; libertad + leftists Jews are their henchmen😌
Thank you #Israel!
