#AbiyAhmed  the president of #Ethiopia is responsible for the most heinous, never ever seen or  heard of, inhumane, disgusting, unbelievably sick crimes against people of #Tigray  ....... #america #europe #israel #uk #LiSA #MAMA2021 #unicef #biden #TigrayGenocide
Israel has nearly as many unicorns as the European Union with a population almost 50 times. Israel also has 135 scientists and engineers for every 10,000 citizens, ‚Äúmore than any other developed country.‚Äù Yet there is a problem. #startup #israel 
#OTD, Yitzhak Rabin, two-time Israeli prime minister and hero for the cause of Jewish nationalism, was assassinated after an historic effort to bring peace to #Israel.   May his memory be a blessing.

‚ÄúThe drill became more complicated as days went on, just like we expect war to become. We know that there are not only soldiers but also reservists who need to be drilled in order to protect the State of #Israel.‚Äù 
The #Israel.i government is heartless, isn't it? And it's not the first time. It also reminds me of what I heard happened to Jewish cemeteries in parts of #Lebanon during/since the Civil War.   #◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú #◊ú◊ë◊†◊ï◊ü #ÿ•ÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ŸäŸÑ #ŸÑÿ®ŸÜÿßŸÜ

In the last decade, Syria has murdered 10x more #Palestinians than ever died fighting #Israel.  Isn't it strange - not a single person sends #racist tweets to #Muslims to defend #Palestine? Fancy that.

@just_security @dialash @theCCR @JoeBiden The mistake #Israel made was being cautious with use of the designation. Obviously there are a great many terrorist and terrorist fronts run by #Palestinians. By limiting to 6, the Palestinians can pick a minor issue and attempt to disprove that which is clear. The designation.
A beautiful holiday! Celebrating the union between #Ethiopian Jews with #Israel 
"Iran poses a strategic threat to the world and an existential threat to #Israel, and they ought not to be allowed to get away with it," said Bennett.

@m7mdkurd That many so they think.  It¬¥s so sad! And it is so clear they have not changed much since #JesusChrist was there:  "they do not know what they do"  In #Israel #Palestine #UnitedNations there should be #HumanRights for all...For All #Wednesday #Wednesdayfeeling 
"It all starts and ends with the fact that these organizations are seen as promoting a boycott of #Israel and the investigation of war crimes at the International Criminal Court. The attack on them is a political one under the guise of security.‚Äù
