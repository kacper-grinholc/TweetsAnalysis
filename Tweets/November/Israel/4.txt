@just_security @dialash @theCCR @JoeBiden The mistake #Israel made was being cautious with use of the designation. Obviously there are a great many terrorist and terrorist fronts run by #Palestinians. By limiting to 6, the Palestinians can pick a minor issue and attempt to disprove that which is clear. The designation.
A beautiful holiday! Celebrating the union between #Ethiopian Jews with #Israel

@m7mdkurd That many so they think.  It´s so sad! And it is so clear they have not changed much since #JesusChrist was there:  "they do not know what they do"  In #Israel #Palestine #UnitedNations there should be #HumanRights for all...For All #Wednesday #Wednesdayfeeling 
"It all starts and ends with the fact that these organizations are seen as promoting a boycott of #Israel and the investigation of war crimes at the International Criminal Court. The attack on them is a political one under the guise of security.”
