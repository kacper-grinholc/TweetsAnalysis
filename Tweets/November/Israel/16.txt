#Israel’s government has decided to sanction ministries that fail to transfer all of their units to #Jerusalem. While two of Israel’s Basic Laws dictate that all government departments be located in Jerusalem, many remain outside the capital.  
“The most inhumane killing machine ever known to man had hit them suddenly. Just as most of them, when being loaded into the trains—like my mother &amp; her family—didn’t know where they were heading.” #Jews #American #Israel #Palestine #Occupation #Apartheid  
@_LFI @Keir_Starmer But supporting #Israel’s apartheid &amp; stifling criticism of its racist rule over #Palestinians really is productive right! He’s happy to sanction Russia China Venezuela etc but not Israel which has committed more crimes against humanity than most countries! #BDS 
Children who learn to hate do not become Peace Partners. For successful peace negotiations #Palestinians &amp; #Israelis must be ready to compromise. Israelis are ready. Do the Palestinians desire peace? I see only antisemitic indoctrination.  #Israel #FreePalestine from #Hamas 
@_LFI @Keir_Starmer Drivel by @Keir_Starmer who has already declared himself an unqualified #Zionist.  Need I say more?  #Israel  #Palestine
Israeli citizens are made up of practicing Jews, Christians and Muslims, as well as other beliefs/non-belief. They have freedom of the press and the freedom to speak ones mind without threat of governmental reprisal. All are equal under the law.  #Israel #Christianity #Muslim

USA and European countries are next.  Is that what you're referring to as double standards or is it only related to #Israel?
The #US would like more countries to establish diplomatic ties with Israel, following the #AbrahamAccords, @USAmbUN said during her first-ever visit to #Israel on Monday.
#Israelis of #Moroccan origin, paving the way for #Morocco, with @gantzbe Benny Gantz, for future military contracts with #Israel   Hope they told him about LORA missile, amont others 🤭😃
