In crowing about #israel falsely labeling 6 #Palestinian #HumanRights groups terrorists, @NGOmonitor says HR supporters "have been unable to counter our fact-based, systematic, and actionable analysis."  Well yes, you can't counter what doesn't exist. See: 
Would add, this is why the reactivation of the Syrian Operations Room was so telling. "The drone attack, which caused no casualties, would be the first time #Iran has directed a military strike against the United States in response to an attack by #Israel." 2/4
"If de Klerk’s life can teach us anything in #Israel-#Palestine, it is that we cannot expect #apartheid defenders to change their minds of their own accords; they must be made to do so." 
I used to be an #antizionist. I had absolutely no understanding that this would mean the displacement and/or murder of millions of Jews.  We should all be #Zionists. Because #Israel EXISTS. We can be Zionists &amp; also advocate for self determination of Palestinians. It's not hard.
