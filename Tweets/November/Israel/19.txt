@MsJulieLenarz @mikelayestaran Shame. #Hamas is terrorist. Then the #Israel apartheid what is?
They want to kill them, starve them, occupy their land &amp; drive them out. That’s the cruel reality of apartheid #Israel : you’ll never see this on TV bc they’re too busy telling you criticising these racist crimes is antisemitic 
Fact check: This is already essentially true in #Israel under new recently imposed policies. 
The true face of the #IDF. Now remember what #Israel claims (They have the most “moral” Army &amp; Democracy in the M.E.) #IsraeliCrimes against children. And the fact that it took 2 grown scum bags to drag away a child who wet himself out of fear…. #FreePalestine 🇵🇸✊🏽♥️ #USA 💵 
#israel  Britain to designate all of Hamas as a terrorist organization. Muslims read it as a designation of Islam as terrorism. Am I Wrong?

#Israel intelligence, saving the lives of U.S soldiers. 
The leaders of #Jordan, #Egypt and the #UAE are more concerned with stabilizing #Syria and trying to minimize #Iran’s influence there than rehabilitating President Bashar Assad. #Israel's view isn't very different

We must fight anti-Semitism but also fight #Israel's de facto annexation of the #WestBank by the peaceful means of Boycott, Divestment &amp; Sanctions, the same way that I support #BDS against abusive regimes like Saudi, Russia, China etc  @hilarypepper

This is what #Hamas brings onto his people, by constantly refusing to sign reconciliación agreements with #Israel and even rejects Arab peace initiatives.  #Palestinians deserve better. 
More than any other government in the world, #Israel uses racial profiling, mass surveillance, and numerous spying techniques to sustain its military occupation of #Palestine. @MintPressNews 
I hope UK will also take concrete steps against #Israel’s apartheid policies, illegal occupation, theft of #Palestinian land, ethnic cleansing, gagging Palestinian human rights orgs, killing of Palestinian kids etc? Perhaps exercise morality to act against Israeli extremism too?
