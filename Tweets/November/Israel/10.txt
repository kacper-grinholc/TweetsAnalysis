.@IsraelMFA You need a strong ally in Africa + that is the emerging #BiafraNation. A statement to prevent the immediately pending #Holocaust of #Biafrans who support #Israel would go far. Please, as an Israeli citizen, I implore you to speak out. #FreeNnamdiKanuNow

[Free Speech Is Only free When It Represents Palestinian anti-#Israel Hate Speech] #Israel’s #Ambassador to #UK Tzipi Hotovely was forced to flee London’s School of Economics and Political Science on Monday night after being violently assaulted by #BDS rioters. 
Never was there such shameful capitulation of Labour MP’s to a racist occupying ethnic cleansing state like #Israel as now. They’re defending a racist Amb who supports the ethnic cleansing of #Palestinians &amp; call protestors antisemites as if supporting racist crimes is ethical! 
Israel's ambassador to the UK was filmed being evacuated from the London School of Economics (LSE) on Tuesday as pro-Palestine students voiced their anger at her appearance  Ambassador Tzipi Hotovely was reportedly addressing the university's debating society  #Israel #Palestine 
#Israel approves #COVID19 shots for kids; experts predict uphill acceptance struggle #vaccines #children  via @timesofisrael
Great to see @itvnews ‘s International Affairs Editor @ragehomaar undertaking a project in #Israel 🇮🇱  Be’hatzlacha and safe travels. 
This morning @ShlomiKofman joined @govgianforte, @BIRDFoundation1, and HealthIL at a Montana-Israel virtual trade summit. The summit focused on how #Montana and #Israel can work together in the world of #DigitalHealth. 
@MiddletonDreams @nmillions25 @joncoopertweets Only the #CDC knows that data &amp; it's only from 9 regions that they track. Otherwise there is no reliable data for vax status in all 50 states. #UK &amp; #Israel publish their data which shows equal or greater deaths among vaxed. My prev post stated that vaxed can die, which is true.
@lisanandy @TzipiHotovely Further apartheid #Israel crimes 
Thankfully, #Israel has many Christian friends &amp; allies, including here in #Ireland, who are not afraid to stand with her in the fight against terror &amp; partner in efforts to counter the lies &amp; spread the truth 🙏🏻🇮🇱 
Heartbreaking. But a daily reality under #Israel's brutal rule, created and perpetuated by #UK's political elite.  #FreePalestine #BDS
