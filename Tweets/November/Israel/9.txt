Watch this video!!!  There is a myth that terrorism against Israel's Jewish population didn't exist pre-1948, the year of the establishment of the State of #Israel. But the facts are undeniable.   
#Israel’s army has deployed a sweeping personal data collection program using facial recognition technology targeting Palestinians in parts of the #occupiedWestBank, an organization working with former soldiers says. 
Rashida Tlaib lies TWICE in 13 seconds. 1) Even #UNWRA said that #Israel used precision in the strikes. 2) "The majority killed were children" - according to the #Hamas 256 were killed , 60 "children" (anyone under 18 is labeled a child) Not bad, Rashida!

Austria‘s Communist Party declares opposition to “disgusting” anti-#Israel boycotts, saying they have Nazi overtones…  #bds
Freedom movement on Tuesday published new video footage, in a letter to the Israeli authorities, which had denied that any Israeli Mossad agents were kidnapped abroad.  #Mossad  #Israel

@SanninoEU @AlonUshpiz @IsraelMFA @eu_eeas #Israel needs to stop killing children
At this late date.  After US recognition.  The fact that #Israel still cannot summon the courage to speak honestly about the #Armenian #Genocide speaks - more than anything else - to its own self-respect as a genocide-survivor state.

Look at this Zionist psyco, sent by the apartheid baby killing government of #Israel 
@haaretzcom While Ha'Aretz has total freedom to spew BS against the so-called oppressor of democracy. Just looking through your timeline and the clickbait headlines, and mixed stoking messages tells all. This publication should be dismantled. It's #Israel's Al Jazeera.
.@CarnegieEndow's recent piece on #China in #Israel's media scene cites one of EWCW's Asia-Pacific Bulletins (APB) by @RYellinek on Israel's place in the Sino-US Great Power competition. Read Carnegie's piece here:  and the APB here: 
Evidence for an association between #breakthrough #COVID19 #infections and the time since #vaccination helped in the decision to authorize #boosters in the U.S. The key data on waning #immunity from #Israel explained on my blog. #NIH 
@jcastiazaran @bravofan86 @RashidaTlaib Yeah  so we should  stop #Israël bc The main reason for the establishment of this entity is the Jewish religion. Israel claims that the land of Palestine belongs to the Jews only. Instead of fighting political Islam, you should fought political Judaism
#HRW @KenRoth writes: #JoeBiden not living up to #HumanRights promise on #Egypt #SaudiArabia #Israel #Syria . Largely true. Israel is surely imperfect, the #settlement policy is shady (to put it mildly), but to put #Israel on a level with Syria etc.🤔?! 
Continued military aid to #Egypt despite al-Sisi's severe repression.Continued arms sales to #Israel despite unlawful strikes killing Palestinian civilians. That's not a foreign policy that centers human rights.
#Israel has approved the entry of #tourists from countries with low and moderate #COVID infection rates if they received two doses of a COVID #vaccine authorized by the @WHO, even if they have not been vaccinated with the #boostershot.
#Israel must adopt this resolution along with its sincere apologies for  the engagement and supporting Baku in the 2nd full-fledged war against #ArtsakhRepublic unleashed by #Azerbaijan-#Turkey duo. Otherwise this circus on the Armenian tragedy is ridiculous and must be stopped.

Travelers to #Israel are frequently subject to abusive #behavior by Population and Immigration Authority officials at Ben Gurion #airport, including threats to handcuff them and ban them from the country.   Report by @jeremysharon  
What is next? Does Israel have the right to spy with complete impunity on American and European organizations, international institutions like the UN, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross? Where does it stop? #Pegasus #Israel #SanctionsOnIsrael

This is not the first time an attempt has been made in the Knesset for #Israel to officially recognize the Armenian Genocide.  There were attempts in 2018 and 2019 but again they did not proceed due to little government support.
