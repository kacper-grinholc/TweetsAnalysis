#Israel on Saturday unveiled new plans to ban all foreigners into the country, a world-first in efforts to curb the spread of the newly detected #COVID19 variant called #Omicron.

@tedcruz Must not forget the history of the airport where terrorists and the left supporters had killings of Jews that Uganda supported at that airport.  Thank god for #Israel
Thank you to the fascist #MEMRI for helping to amplify my message. Your intimidating tactics from the Nazi's textbook, may well belong to fascists regimes, like your darlings in #Israel and the #UAE, but not here in the U.S.  
This is great news. It's interesting that, unlike #UAE, those countries who refuse to normalise ties with #Israel are also those countries wedded to backwardness. 
All countries don't know what is scientific approach.  They influence on political based.  Most of countries punished Africa but not #Israel #Belgium #Germany #UK #HongKong . #Omicron #covidvariant

This is just the beginning of what the #AbrahamAccords will bring. Thank you @kh_lorena and his highness @HHShkMohd for helping #UAE together with #Israel/#Bahrain /#Sudan /#Morocco lead the way. May your light and the light of #Hanukkah  shine.  
Happy Hanukkah, the festival of lights, dear friends in #Israel and across the globe. Thinking back at many a joyous Hanukkah during my time in Israel.

Another reminder that: #Israel is the #Jew among the nations. antiZionism equals #antisemitism.   When we light the menorah tonight to celebrate #Hanukkah, we dispel the dark so let’s make sure to shine a great light for ISRAEL 🇮🇱 &amp; Jews everywhere.  Happy Hanukkah 🕎 
Everyone seems to be worried about the future of democracy in #Israel. However, the explanations depend on whom one asks, and one conclusion is that one of the fundamental problems is that not everyone is really committed to #democracy.  Opinion

Unbelieveble: when #Iran, #USA &amp; #Europe are negotiating, Iranian forces spokeman claims: "Our main goal is to destroy #Israel. We will never give up this goal even if we die". And the world wishes to compromise with Iran...
After 40 years Israel recognizes that Iran is a bigger fish to fry in US frying pan. Plan B ? There are none. #Iran #Israel #USA
