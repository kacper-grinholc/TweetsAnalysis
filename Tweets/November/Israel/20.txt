The Regressive Left love #Hamas and hate #Israel. Yes, they love terrorists that hate America and are dedicated to the destruction of Israel and the #Genocide of all #Jews living there.  The #USA, #Canada and #Britain recognize Hamas as a terrorist group. #squad 
@SenChucks Rep. Malinowski is toxic and  he was no friend to #Israel nor we expect to be friend to #Ethiopia Hwvr, he has to stop the false narration of genocide. HRW already reported this and debunked the genocide hoax. Why is he bought in to this hoax by a lobbyist #NoMore 
@skwawkbox Saying this again 4 the people at the back: @Keir_Starmer is a #Racist! His REAL allegiance is 2 the #IsraelLobby w/ it’s #Zionist ‘front’ organisations (.@_LFI #JLM #BoD #BICOM) &amp; the #Embassy of #Israel in London! When they say ‘jump’ he asks ‘how high?’ 
.@bep You wouldn’t have performed in apartheid South Africa, so why #apartheid #Israel? #Artwashing apartheid hurts Indigenous #Palestinians resisting Israel's regime of occupation, siege, #ethniccleansing &amp; apartheid! #WhereIsTheLoveforPalestinians

UN Human Rights Council : #Israel bombs killed 66 children in #Gaza - Including 12 recovering from previous attacks, during its 11-day bombardment, which killed at least 253 citizens.  This is #WarCrimes. This is #StateTerrorism. This is #Genocide.   
So far this is the best way to describe #Israel #FreePalestine

@swilkinsonbc You do not need to be a supporter of radical #Islam to know #Hamas is principly a #Resistance group that #Israel helped create *and still needs* to justify their continued repression of a captive, half starved population.  #Palestine  #IsraeliApartheid
@NourMortaja Down to #Israel . We hope #ThePromisedSaviour will come and rescue all palestinian.
Buyers remorse should be affecting intelligent "Jews" who stupidly voted for #Biden thinking he was a moderate. He is seeking to renew the flawed #Iran deal which is far worse now and greater existential threat to #Israel.
Report that 100 so called celebrities signed a letter condemning #Israel for condemning #Palestinian PLFP front organization that support the terrorist organization. Who cares? It's the usual suspects.
Where are all the Pro-#Zionist activists spewing how great of a democratic state #Israel is? Come out, you frauds!  Settlers attack homes, one with live fire; soldiers shoot at #Palestinians trying to defend their property.  [Read]

Even if #Israel succeeds in normalizing diplomatic relations with all 21 #Arab countries, it will not enjoy lasting peace and stability until it recognizes #Palestinian statehood and normalizes relations with the state of #Palestine. 
This is the stuff of Hollywood scripts- a couple arrested in a foreign country on charges of spying- they say they were taking pics of a popular tourist site- their government intervenes- they're released- but at what price? #Israel #Turkey #Erdogan

I think Arab allies trust #israel. More?  Most of the 200 American troops stationed at the base, whose main role is training Syrian militias to fight the Islamic State, had been evacuated after being tipped off by Israeli intelligence, officials said.
