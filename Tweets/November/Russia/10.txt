In the late 1800s, with the onset of drastic government changes, Germans began emigrating from #Russia to the US, with large populations settling in the #Midwest. Zane Bergen‚Äôs great-grandparents came to the US with thousands of other Germans from Russia.
My biggest concern is that the troop movements towards the border of #Ukraine in spring 2021 were part of a larger plan. Yes, they should intimidate Kiev. Maybe enable #Russia to take by force what it could‚Äônt achieve by proxies yet. But what if it opens up additions options?
NEW: Decades of receding interest &amp; steep cuts in aid &amp; investment for African nations from countries including Canada have enabled #China &amp; #Russia to fill the gap. @kolga calls for the West to reengage &amp; counter this authoritarian dominance. #cdnpoli 
@POTUS #America looses a great country (as world look, poorest but untouched full of resources), a great people (as you illiterate but they own natural wisdom) #Ethiopia. 110milion ppl and Almighty God will protect our mother land and PM Abiy #EthiopiaPrevails Lookin #China and #Russia
4/ In my opinion #Putin has decided to draw a line in #Belarus. He has lost #Ukraine from the #Russia|n sphere of influence. He seems adamant not to repeat the same with Minsk. The secret meetings with Lukashenko earlier probably have decided the next steps in #Putin|s plan.
Literature is revolutionary! This course examines the transition from Imperial #Russia to the Soviet Union as it relates to #art, #literature, and #film. Sign up for HUM309 this Spring and make some new comrades! #SFU #humanities #revolution More details:  
3/ While #Putin probably want to avoid an unlimited conflict it seems that the window for diplomatic solutions has been closed. #Russia feels encircled and it will try everything to destabilize NATO countries. It also pursues its own goals in the #Ukraine .
2/ Unfortunately a local European war is not impossible. Quite frankly the long period of #peace that we have experienced in Europe over the last 75 years (war in the Balkans excluded) is the exception. The development in 2021 is pointing to a future conflict. #Russia #NATO

Knights of Malta (US) Sovereign State  delighted to see NATO enforcing the Black Sea borders. It is time that United Nations admonish #Russia and #China for their misuse of International Waters and Seas. 
President #Biden‚Äôs contradictions are quite staggering recently. He called for #OPEC &amp; #Russia to pump more #oil to push #gas prices down while pursuing an aggressive anti-oil agenda even against #US oil &amp; gas industry!  No wonder.. his approval rating has fallen to all-time low!

With regards the proposed auction of grounded aircraft in #Kenya, @StateHouseKenya, @JamesMacharia_, @KenyaAirports, @NationAfrica, @citizentvkenya, I implore you NOT to auction them. Instead use them as your first inventory for a National Aviation Museum. This one is in #Russia.
