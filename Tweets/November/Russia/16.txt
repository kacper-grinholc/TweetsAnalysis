Why #Russia shot down its old #satellite and what weapon was used:Moscow says it was demonstrating its capability to defend itself in space and experts believe that the S-500 was behind the "performance".

What #Belarus and indirectly #Russia is doing with the EU border is an invasion and using human suffering for political gains. This is a dangerous and aggressive precedent. #Lukashenka and Putin are not just thugs of Eastern Europe but threats to the whole continent.
