The leaders of #Ukraine and #Russia as well as the #BalticStates should be aware that certain European and U.S. ‚Äòthink tanks‚Äô provide streams of MISINFORMATION on Russia and ignore its legitimate security concerns re NATO aggression. @Latvian_MFA @MFAestonia @LithuaniaMFA

In Russia you would expect the people to stay indoors all the time in such a cold place. However, in the #Soviet Union, in what is now #Russia, there was a practice in the 1950s and 1970s to make small children sleep outside, for fresh air and sunlight. 
CentralBank stated, that the #crypto market at #Russia, almost $5bl/y, close to stocks market. BUT still there is no regulation?) 
That new genre bender of The Deer Hunter, Der Wildschuetz, and Life of Lenin they are staging life now in #Russia is quite a thing.

Discussed with #AngelaMerkel the security situation and the concentration of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine. Agreed on the need to coordinate international efforts to localize threats from #Russia. Noted the importance of continuing the work of the #N4 format. 
Unfortunately, I have my doubts about western resolve in this domain as well. #Russia #Ukraine 
In #Russia, another day of Moscow court hearings re #Memorial: apparently extremely weak showing by prosecution and a strong defense; journalists admitted. Intriguing. Much useful coverage on @tvrain.

A war would benefit USA (+ arms suppliers) discouraging EU-Russia cooperation since long. @ZelenskyyUa #Ukraine has not learned from #Finland‚Äôs consultations with #Russia prior to joining EU (but not NATO). USA &amp; NATO are still provoking Moscow, not the other way around!  
Earlier today, the Supreme Court of Russia postponed the @hrc_memorial liquidation case until 14 December. In the name of decency and respect for millions of victims of historic and present-day wrongs in #Russia, it should be thrown out altogether. Stand with #Memorial. 
Mud ("Rasputitsa season") and the need for more troops on the ground make a large-scale Russian invasion of #Ukraine unlikely until January at the earliest (and gives a diplomatic window)  @bpolitics @MarcChampion1 @AlbertoNardelli @JenniferJJacobs #Russia
