@433 It was 90 minutes footbal school for #Russia  from #vatreni
Why Republicans love Putin's #Russia so much. #GQPTraitorsToDemocracy #maga. 
@zadok50 @_nerdy_witch #Putin, #Facebook and #Trump started these violent plates spinning in 2015, and it now requires very little effort to make us turn on each other. It's still an #ActiveMeasure but #MAGA has taken on the #Russia role. Death threats are un-American.
Sooner or later, a pathogen that we have no immunity against, no treatment for, and is deadly, will be released from thawing permafrost and glaciers. (Worse than anthrax that thawed and killed reindeer and a child in #Russia🇷🇺!) 
In a sense, #Putin’s funding of #UKIP and #Leave.EU was no more than the continuation of a long-standing #Russian practice since the 1920s of providing money for politicians and organisations which sympathised with the foreign policy objectives of #Russia. 
Only when the Arabs reach a conclusion that the #Zioinst #American will never ever never ever involve in any kind of conflict or wars against #Iran or against #China or against #Russia, only then #Arabs will correct their foriegn politics to the right direction.
#BREAKING Thousands of refugees   struck at Belarusian-Polish border.  #breakibgnews #Belarus #EU #England #earthquake #India #Iraq #Russia #Internationalleaks #UK #UN #Usa #France #Germany #Mali #Africa #England  #Poland #Belarus 
#Ukraine says #Russia amassed 100K troops near border, Blinken raises 'real concerns' of invasion 
While the #Biden admin. arms and puts preessure on #Kiev's nazi regime to confront #Russia, #China is developing modern communications systems and clean energy production in #Cuba, a country known for sending dodors wherever needed. That's why China is going to rule the world. 
@Kaala_Nag Wondering if they (#Putin &amp; #angelamerkel) will fight on the borders or against the #COVID19 in the hospitals? Cases are alarmingly rising both in #Russia &amp; #Germany  But again, Who's going get the benefit? 🇨🇳!!!
"The US is resolved to withdraw its troops from #Syria. The view of the #Biden administration is that this exit requires the cooperation of #Russia, #Assad, and #Iran."
Elections 2024 will be a total farce, meanwhile we might not get there as, @POTUS is antagonizing war in Europe further allowing @NATO expansionist operations to make #Russia feel under threat as NATO combined arms operations occur on their border like it’s all good. 
Imagine leading your group all along and losing the last game through an own goal and miss qualifying for World Cup. #Russia
The larger point: #Russia labored surreptitiously to interfere in our election to help #Trump and #Trump publicly invited them to even if he didn’t collude. But the #SteeleDossier was widely viewed as fishy and the media frenzy it caused a sorry episode.  
"#Putin authorised a secret spy agency operation to support a 'mentally unstable' #Trump in the 2016 US presidential #election during a closed session of #Russia’s national security council, according to what are assessed to be leaked #Kremlin documents"
#Breaking  The outgoing head of the UK’s armed forces Nick Carter has said :  "The military will have to be ready for war with Russia after recent tensions in eastern Europe"  #England #Russia #Europe 
Putin offers help to resolve crisis at Belarus and EU border #Esta #Russia #EuropeanUnion #Belarus

@Yulisha Same historical cycle will repeat itself again here &amp;a day of reckoning for those Kiev inarticulate  idiots will not be far off in coming where they will become human compost in ground in #Russian #Donbass once more for trying 2 threaten #Mother #Russia @Yulisha @RT_com
@elonmusk don’t worry about @BernieSanders it’s only a matter of time before he decides to go back home to #Russia
As #Russia is trying to devide #Europe and marginalize #Poland, #Ukraine should support our Polish friends  - both diplomatically and in any other possible way!  #Polska 
Imagine your neighbor being able to fine you because shop at a different supermarket than he does!!!  That's how fracking asinine this sounds.   #India may face #US #sanctions as it takes delivery of S-400 missile systems from #Russia 
@Yulisha The only cycle of violence that dominates there is when #Mother #Russia enemies are violently overwhelmingly defeated military in the battlefield and then executed  before burying them in earth of #Russian #Donbass as a form of human fertilizer there Yulia 😀
Mutual shelling renewed between government forces and armed opposition factions in northwest #Syria. #Idlib #HTS #SNA #SAA #Turkey #Russia  
"The outgoing head of the UK’s armed forces has said the military will have to be ready for war with Russia...but he does not believe Vladimir Putin really wants “hot war” with the west."  I can't fully express how utterly insane this sounds.  #Russia
@trussliz @Telegraph Of course we do not seek war , but if it comes to that I am confident we will prevail just as #MargaretThatcher did in the 1980s !🇬🇧 #RuleBritannia  #BelarusBorder #Russia
Needless to say, even (and especially) under #Putin, the #Lenin-monuments have not been removed in #Russia proper.
