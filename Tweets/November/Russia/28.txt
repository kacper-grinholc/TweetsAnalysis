As we focus on the holidays, keep an eye on #Xi's People's Republic of #China and its ongoing pressure campaign against #Taiwan. #Russia is threatening #Ukraine as well. Both emboldened by chaotic #Afghanistan exit.  @MoNDefense @TPPF

ICYMI: "How far will the new German government go in order to coordinate with EU partners and the U.S. to deter #Russia from attacking #Ukraine?" asks @nytimes (h/t @bueti)  
@esmolar You are too charitable to the latter Gieniu. He sounds a bit less extreme but both know perfectly well that their narratives do not stand up to any factual scrutiny and can only be explained by a conscious wish to whitewash autocratic, aggressive and revisionist #Russia
#CAATSA sanctions, if applied, will bolster and serve #China’s interest &amp; to an extent that of #Russia, both of whom for different reasons want to undermine the growing #IndiaUS ties. The sanctions ball is in the American court: Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty. 
@AschRonald @QuirinWeber @MorawieckiM . Poland has not renewed its gas contract with #Russia and supplies will run out next year, I believe. Its industry will suffer from higher energy costs. And, Polish and Baltic politcians get pampered by the US and its #MIC. They spoil for polarisation if  not #war.

This is depressing and worrying in view of the big challenge posed by aggressive #Russia. Contrary to the arguments disclosed here it is actually Berlin’s position that is undermining transatlantic unity. Would have been unthinkable years ago when #Germany was the frontline Ally.
