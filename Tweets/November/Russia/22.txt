@essenviews 🙄We all know what it means when France/Germany (or the @EU and the West in general) warn #Russia of 'serious consequences'...  - Nothing🙄🤬
WTO-IMF COVID-19 Vaccine Trade Tracker  According to the tracker #Russia exported a bit more than 80 million doses (#SputnikV) (~2.9% of world exports)  Other SputnikV exports could have come from partners ex: South Korea   #WTO #IMF #CovidExportTracker   
"#Japan and #SouthKorea expressed concern about the patrol...Tokyo had lodged a protest...[South Korea]’s JCS added that it had assessed the patrol as a 'joint exercise between #China and #Russia and [that] additional analysis is needed'."

3/ Note lack of mention of #OPEC+ output cuts' role in "surging INFLATION" as Fin Media discusses inflation danger. And no mention of how much Koch/U.S. #oil producers benefit from OPEC/#Russia output curbs. As if OPEC's cuts by design aren't qualifying supply disruptions. #OOTT

That's the point. "Green" energy as done by the leftist mobs is not about becoming energy independent or securing the environment. Otherwise, they would have been transparent about fossil fuels still needed to run the new tech &amp; pressured #China &amp; #Russia on relevant issues. 
@GOP @FoxNews While the US was added to backsliding democracies, #Ukraine was removed.  Ukraine's democracy improved! No small feat given #Russia's years of hybrid warfare to destabilize Ukraine. Putin's war is all about making #democracy fail, so his kleptocracy can reign &amp; steal w/ impunity.
