Belarus President Willing to Host Russian Nukes If NATO’s Move Further East NATO threatened to move nuclear weapons closer to Russia if Germany stops hosting them by Dave DeCamp @DecampDave #Belarus #NATO #Russia #Germany #nukes   
In southern #Russia, the Russian armed forces began a military exercise involving more than 10,000 troops: 
@Andy_Scollick @globeandmail #Putin has stated that #Russia will soon have Tsirkon hypersonic missiles capable of flying at Mach 9 speeds (About 6850 miles per hour) and hitting targets over 1,000 kilometers away.
Seeing @jensstoltenberg jumping up &amp; down waving his hands about, his eyes flicking side to side while threatening #Russia (for perceived aggression) for his whole interview made me wonder, "What's He's ON"? #NATO are out of their depth! It's as simple &amp; as clear cut as that. 
#Russia | Putin said that relations between the West and his country in the 1990s of the last century were “almost idyllic.” But “things have reached the point where (NATO) missile defense systems are now deployed in Poland and Romania.”

#Ukraine’s foreign minister Kuleba is expected to raise the issue of #Russia’s blocking of the #OSCE SMM, Trilateral Contact Group, and violating the #Minsk agreements, during his meetings in Riga and Stockholm. Ukraine will seek a “comprehensive package” for deterring Russia.
#Lavrov is baselessly accusing #Ukraine of preparing for a “military adventure” against #Russia, and posing a “direct threat” - none of which is true. Russian senior officials bluntly distort facts, demonstrating that Russian behavior cannot be changed with any compromises.
#Putin claims the build-up of forces at #Ukraine's borders is aimed at “improving relations” in the area of security. His comments exemplify #Russia’s twisted approach to international relations, which relies on the use of force and propaganda.  THREAD:
