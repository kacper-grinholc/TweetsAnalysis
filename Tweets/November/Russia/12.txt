On the other hand being so dependent about the gas on #Russia cannot be a long-term solution, we have to think now for different scenarios. Our national security is at risk! #Poland
#Russia and #Turkey should withdraw their troops from #Libya with no delays in order to stabilize the country, French President #EmmanuelMacron said.
By sending 10 troops to #Poland to help with #bordersecurity is #laughable and hides a bigger picture of having #UKTroops on the ground in Poland in case #Russia or #Belarus make a move on Poland. 10 #troops to help with thousands of #immigrants! #MorkcallingOrson  
There was a time when it looked like #Russia and #China would move towards being open democratic states. #Putin could have taken Russia 'into #Europe' and modernised. Instead he has retrenched into an extractive economic model based on carbon which only has short term traction.

Russian Foreign Minister #Lavrov:  #NATO has been recently aggressive towards #Russia. 
I would've asked "How'bout the OLD "harm to #Ukraine’s territorial integrity", that #Russia's already done, and continues doing with #France's help?" - if I was delusional about FRA foreign policy (and statehood in general). @RymMomtaz try this follow up Q when you get a chance. 
The #Ukraine-#Turkey cooperation on #drones actually goes further and has intensified today with #Baykar agreeing to use Ukrainian Turbofan engines the drones. #Russia, undoubtedly, is far from thrilled.
