@DamResist #Russia or #China could hit us with an electromagnetic pulse at any time &amp; shut down everything that depends on power, even our cars which depend on electronics! You know who'd be fine if we got hit by an electromagnetic pulse? The #Amish, they'd be fine.

@DamResist In fact, #Russia has perfected electromagnetic pulse weapons.  We have too, I suppose, but without killing anything, an electromagnetic pulse shuts down everything forever, and it's entirely within #Putin's, and probably #Biden's capacity to do. No cars!
