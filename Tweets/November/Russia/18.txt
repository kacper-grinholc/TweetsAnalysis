Whenever I am wrestling with a problem, I always try to imagine what Vladimir Putin's response would be.   Maybe one day annexing Crimea will be the answer.  #Russia #Crimea #Vladimir #Putin #VladimirPutin

Why has #Ukraine, and #NATO, not learned from #Finland‚Äôs careful consultations with #Russia prior to joining EU (but prudently staying out of @NATO)? USA and EU are still provoking Moscow, not the other way around! Georgia 2008 a similar issue. cc @ZelenskyyUa @MedvedevRussia

More background here on the #Iran|ian operation and some by #Russia to meddle with #Election2020:
@henokgabisa #Turkey and #UAE along with #China &amp; #Russia are destabilizers, providing Drones &amp; weapons to genociders, they are putting fuel on fire. #US &amp; #EU should call out the abusers. Human rights before fear of immigrants.
Less than a week after #Belarus soldiers first attacked #Poland servicemen with annoying #laser at the border, turns out a Ukraine soldier was half-blinded by SIMILAR but more potent #Russia weapon in Donbas - at roughly the same time, in repetition of the 2016-2019 incidents. 
Now its #Iran ü§£ü§£üòÇ funny how you go from #Russia to #Iran... When #China? üòÇüòÇü§£ 
@adalhaug Correct. What Putin just said was nothing other than: "#Russia may attack #Ukraine, but the West may not defend it. This is a red line."  He said that this had been said many times, but the West was very superficial about it, to put it mildly.üôÑ
Finland is one of the countries that has upheld close contact with Moscow despite the deteriorating east-west relations.  via @AtleStaalesen @BarentsNews  #Finland #Russia #Arctic #Barents
#Russia, of course, never admitted to using blinding lasers (or waging the #Donbas war whatsoever). However, #Ukraine claims of such use have been reported as credible by #OSCE. A hard indirect proof is the official, open use of #laser weapons by RU domestic services. 5/5
Use of blinding #laser is, of course, a #warcrime prohibited by the 1995 Unusual and Non-Selective Weapons Treaty, to which #Russia is a signatory. And yet she's repeatedly used such weapons: lasers ag #Ukraine; [allegedly] "Cuba Syndrome" ultrasound weapons ag. US diplomats. 4/5
BRKNG: #Russia army used blinding lasers against #Ukraine troops in #Donbas AGAIN, "a short time ago": UA mil. media citing a soldier undergoing treatment after an "abrupt flash" partially blinded him; his doctors at military and civilian hospitals.  1/5

@Anteportas7 You do not know? There are refugees from #Afghanistan and #Syria in #Russia, there are interviews with them, you can read them if you know Russian. But these asylum seekers on border with #Belarus want to go to #Germany, #Belgium, etc., because they already have relatives there.
