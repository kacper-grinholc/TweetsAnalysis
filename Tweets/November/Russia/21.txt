Thank you #Russia and #China. 
@MarQs__ This could be true. #Russia|n reservists can be "rung," to call up without formal documentation. They're brought to a rally point, usually on a weekend or early morning hours, and meet buses. Their families don't see or hear from them for a while.   This happened in Syria too
What can be expected next? If a summit meeting really takes place #Russia will try to get in a strong position for any negotiations. The troop build-up at #Ukraine 's border certainly fits into the picture. 👇
With everything going on with the rumored buildup by #Russia  on the #Ukraine border in what some are calling a staging for an offensive, I would recommend those who may not understand the situation gain some historical perspective. I recommend reading: 
To deter Russian aggression, the international community must express urgent support for #Ukraine by statements as well as physical protection!  #Russia #agression
If the idea of a meeting between #Biden and #Putin before year's end holds true, it could be some form of last ditch effort. It certainly will be decisive about how the #USA and #Russia will engage each other in the future.
I get a bad feeling about the current development in Eastern Europe. RT_com presents the #Russia|n view in the following article. A compromise seems not likely. And the alternative means another war in Europe ... We all know what that means! 
Deeply depressing developments in #Putin's #Russia. The worry is that an insecure Putin will look for more "enemies" abroad to strengthen his grip on power at home.

Breaking ⚡️ The first combat use of Javelin in #Donbas  For the first time in the Donbas, the Ukrainian Armed Forces used the Javelin portable anti-tank missile system. Soon, modern Russian ATGM systems will appear in the hands of the Donbas Army. #Russia #Ukraine #Conflict
Question for military Twitter: If #Russia is planning to invade #Ukraine, wouldn't conventional wisdom dictate that they muster something like 3x the number of defending troops to ensure success? As far as I have seen, Ukraine can easily mobilize 300k, so Russia then needs 900k?
