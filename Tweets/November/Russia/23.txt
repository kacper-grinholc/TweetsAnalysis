We don't ever have to worry about "accidental" defenestration, polonium tea, "suicide" with suspicious M.O.s, or getting snatched off the street with a bag over one's head.  The #US isn't perfect, but it sure beats #Russia.
In the United States, we have the right to say mean things about any president without criminal repercussions.  And unlike #Russia, the press can criticize the president in any way, shape, or form. For instance, people have the right to shout, "Let's go Brandon" or "Fuck Trump."
Haven't 'simulation exercises' of bombing each other to oblivion been part of #Russia's and #US's favorite war games for decades? The rest of us just hope they remain simulation exercises!

Mali🇲🇱-Russia🇷🇺cooperation: Received Amb. of the Federation of #Russia in Mali HE Mr. Igor GROMYKO @IgorGromyko who reiterated Russia's attachment to respecting the sovereignty of Mali &amp; taking into account the aspirations of Malians in the conduct of the Transition 
#Russia-#Ukraine: "Nothing about our concern has changed" per @StateDeptSpox   "Unusual" Russian military activity "a cause for concern for the #UnitedSates. It's a cause for concern for our Ukrainian partners. It's also a cause for concern for our European allies"
Who is everyone seems to agree Minsk accords are bad deal? Are you referring to #France, #Germany, #Russia and #Ukraine? Who put a gun to Ukraine's head when #Poroshenko in front of leaders of France, Germany, Russia signed Minsk? The problem is Ukraine never wanted to follow it

In occupied #Crimea, this #Russia|n tank is fitted with what looks like a type of slat armour over the turret specifically designed to protect against top down attack like the Javelin ATGM, which are now in use by #Ukraine’s armed forces:    
@ChristopherJM Fortunately, there are many people in Ukraine who are against the war with #Russia, who sees total utopia even to consider a real war against Russia. Even with all the the help that current government of #Ukraine gets from US, EU, NATO, Ukraine won't be able to win that war.
Great to host acting prodigy Arseniy Cassidy &amp; friends. The young actor of Russian lineage is on the fast track to Hollywood stardom. He is also an F1 fan. A Rich Vodka order of the day 🇬🇧 🇷🇺  #RichEnergy #Vodka #ArseniyCassidy #Actor #UK #Russia #Hollywood #F1 
New detentions of Crimean Tatar activists in #Crimea. 31 persons detained, incl. women&amp;journalists. They greeted lawyer Edem Semedlyaev, whose term of detention had expired. #Russia must immediately stop arbitrary detentions&amp;arrests and release all illegally detained 🇺🇦 citizens. 
@McFaul Exactly. Let's strengthen Ukrainian democracy, keep them on our side, and strengthen them militarily. Let Russia start worrying. #Ukraine #russia #putinIsStillAThug
6/end And god forbid any current discussion of any threat from #Russia's free ride as quasi-#OPEC (master) or any OPEC member's debt to U.S. for post-WW2 decolonization or for not ending up as Soviet satellites or as Saddam &amp; IRGC vassal states. And good luck w/China. #OOTT #oil

#Russia is interested in the #HMSQueenElizabeth #aircraftcarrier because 3 nations have flown jets off it- #British, American, even #Italian F-35B Lightning jets from the Italian carrier Cavour have landed, refuelled, and relaunched from her deck. #Navy
@DrJJanes Economic relations are not a one-way street. #Russia has much to lose if it tries to use #NordStream2 to blackmail Western Europe or if it turns out to be an unreliable supplier. Why is this project used to distance ourselves from Russia? Economic weakness results in instability

@ektaka @ChristopherJM @NatashaBertrand #Russia had warned #NATO, #US and #Ukraine. If NATO allows Ukraine to join, it will lead to an end of Ukraine as sovereign nation. If this is what NATO &amp; US wants, then it will happen. Putin set a red line.

First Moscow court hearing re #Memorial in #Russia. 1) Obviously, trying to suppress Memorial is scandalous. I'd like to add: 2) If you want to help, yes, pls, make public appeals, but leave out the arrogant Cold War rhetoric. Put your infowar ego second and don't score points.
