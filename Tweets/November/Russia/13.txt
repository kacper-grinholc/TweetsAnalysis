#Poland may close border crossings and railway communication with #Belarus  If this happens, Belarus will practically lose transit to Europe, which will affect not only the economic situation in the country but also the interests of #Russia and #China. 
The only way to solve crises in #Ukraine and #Georgia is for @NATO to give these countries their full military backing. Then and only then shall the world put an end to #Russia's imperialism!

#Russia is a great friend of #Ethiopia who talked loud for the sovereignty of this proud ancient nation. History will always remember this. Thank you #NoMore #TPLFTerroristGroup #HandsoffEthiopia 
@AbiyAhmedAli @JustinTrudeau It is difficult to get a true friend from Western leaders.  It is best to consolidate the relationship with #China, #Russia, #India to the highest level. Ethiopians have got the opportunity to see the true faces of Westerners!
