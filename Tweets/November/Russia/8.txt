#Russia 🇷🇺 praised the integrity of #Nicaragua 🇳🇮's re-election of Daniel Ortega   Lavrov stated that Nicaragua has been a target of "interference" in its internal affairs since 2018
#Ethiopia 🇪🇹's ambassador to #Russia 🇷🇺 slammed reports that the TPLF are surrounding Addis Ababa as "fake news"   Russia has been quiet in the latest escalation in #Tigray but has consistently backed non-interference in Ethiopia's internal affairs
@HannaLiubakova @yleuutiset It is frustrating while so many reporters in #Belarus, #Russia, #Poland, ... have to take such risks without any support from lazy appeasers of Putin. Shame on You #MattiRönkä   Luckily #astudio starts at least by mentioning #hybridwar, but they really try to blame Poland 🙄

1 and only reason Lukashenka is still in “power”, is because of support from #Russia. #Belarus has been turned in to a prison, and a human trafficking hub. Can you see who the Belarusian people have been in a fight with for last 1.5 years?
