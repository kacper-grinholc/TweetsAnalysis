Sun, Nov 7th in #Vilnius #protest for the right to #asylum curtailed at the #Belarus border with #Lithuania but also with #Poland &amp; #Latvia where #migrants get stranded and die due to #pushbacks. Facebook event:  More context:  
A 30-year-old pregnant woman died of septic shock in 22nd wk of pregnancy as a result of the draconic #abortionlaw in #Poland. Yet anti-choice groups continue their misogynist work &amp; want an abortion ban also in cases of rape &amp; incest.   #anijednejwiecej  
After finding a way across #Poland in the increasingly cold temperatures, they encounter a climate of hostility in Germany. Fascist and far-right groups are mobilising to use violence against fleeing people and prevent them from crossing the border.
Germany, too, is involved in closing Europe's external borders more and more rather than fulfilling its obligation to grant people seeking protection their human right to asylum. #Poland #Belarus
