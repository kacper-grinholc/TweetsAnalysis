November 9, 1941 | Jewish people working in a bakery in the Litzmannstadt Ghetto, occupied #Poland. Factories were established in the ghetto for the German war economy. They worked under terrible conditions of hunger and hardship; many died on the job.   @yadvashem Photo Archive.

Again communist broadcaster @BBCNewsNight slates #Poland for keeping out the migrant parasites from their border. I stand with Poland and not the communist views of the U.K. public broadcaster ‚Ä¶ aka propagandist.
Hard to see how #Poland is "defending Europe" as long as they remain in the EU. 
I truly support the EU. With my great attention I watched and listened tge debate of today in #Poland . And the Polish Prime Minister @MorawieckiM rightly mentioned the #eu can be very mind changing about the migration policy.  #world #polska #eu #migrants
Sagarmediainc Polish PM Mateusz Morawiecki on Tuesday ,Vladimir Putin of orchestrating an unprecedented wave of migrants trying to illegally enter #Poland from #Belarus and threatening to destabiliseEU AFP Denmark, Sweden, Norway as role models for ambitious climate protection. 
EU expresses solidarity with Poland. Meanwhile Poland:                                 Refuses support from Europol and Frontex Denies access to NGOs and journalists  Pushes back migrants in violation of the Dublin regulation It‚Äôs 53% against the reception of refugees #Poland
Situation at the border between #Poland and #Belarus assessed as a "hybrid attack launched by the Belarusian regime": #EuropeanUnion. üá™üá∫ 
#NATO stands in solidarity with #Poland. And this the correct stance. A year ago, the alliance was absent when an identical case involving members, #Greece and #Turkey, emerged. Credibility takes years to be built and a decision or two to get destroyed. 
I'm reading abt the situation at #Poland-#BelarusBorder &amp; dire circumstances leading to migrants' deaths. This reminds me of a Syrian show which captured a teen girl dying in her mother's arms after crossing the Mediterranean.  Those being politicized in this conflict are humans.
"Refugees as leverage - the situation between #Poland and #Belarus ". By the way, preparations for the next round of blackmail began. #Serbia /#Hungary will soon be in the headlines. Be ready! 
This plot to smuggle migrants to #Poland appears to be part of a much larger collusion of corrupt interests, as the Belarussian dictator Lukashenka recently met with #Qatar's Emir Tamim.

@PiotrMuller  (a spokesman for the #Polish government) said that #Poland expects further escalation on the border in the form of hostilities in the near future. Dangerous‚Ä¶

Watching the #BBCNews #NewsAtTen, the road from Ku≈∫nica, #Poland to the border with #Belarus wasn't accessible by the Google Streetview car in 2012:   You can't get much nearer than where that link takes you.

@bedford_colleen @PeggyFagan45 #AlexanderLukashenko is playing political games with the West over refugees (of whatever status), deliberately allowing them free access across #Belarus to a known closed border with #Poland . In doing so he is inflating his own ego further but guilty of people trafficking.

#Poland has accused #Belarus of staging an ‚Äúattack‚Äù on its eastern border &amp; President Vladimir Putin of orchestrating an intensifying migration crisis to destabilize the EU as hundreds of migrants remained trapped at the bloc's eastern frontier.
Polish riot police deployed against migrants at EU border   #Poland #Belarus #HumanRights
Little shocked about #Poland‚Äôs treatment of #refugees.   In fact I am fucking sickened.   Refugees are starving on the border of Poland and Poland is stood by watching.   What the fuck! I refuse to ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù or ‚Äúnice‚Äù to anyone, anymore.   Help refugees!
Looks like #Turkey #Erdogan involved in the #migrationcrisis at the #Belarus #Poland border
