What‚Äôs happening at the #Poland-#Belarus border is shameful. I want to double underline that there *is no silver lining* here.   It‚Äôs also important that this act of sacredness and dignity exists. üëá

Bravo to @elisabethbraw - described as it is: an engineered border-violation crisis. And no worries - as you know, Poles will not lose faith in their armed forces. For those who don‚Äôt know the history of #Poland: we never surrender to blackmail of dictators.

üá¨üáß|At the #EU border between #Poland and #Belarus, thousands of #migrants have again tried to storm the border fences. #Merkel phoned #Lukashenko and offered humanitarian aid. 2015 started the same way. #Europe has to live with the result. #ID 
Nothing happens on the #border without the participation and approval of the Belarusian services that coordinate the migratory pressure on #Poland.   @MON_GOV_PL : The migrants were equipped with stun grenades by the #Belarusian services and attacked #Polish soldiers and officers

How many more tragedies have to occur in order for people to take action. This is a human crisis. People trapped at the #Belarus and #Poland border are literally dying from hunger and cold, with no shelter, and protection. Please take action! #RefugeesAreDying @UN_HRC #RUSU

One of my all-time favorite statues - a fire-breathing dragon, in Krakow, Poland. Wish I had gotten a better shot of it. Maybe next time - smile. We had a short housesit here, that we enjoyed every minute of! #adventure #statue #dragons #photography #travel #Poland @Housesitting 
@JackPosobiec The West is in crisis. It is good that there are still such countries as Poland.  I prefer Poland defending its nation and security, rather than CNN madness!  Folks watch #Poland and learn how to stand for your land!! #HoldTheLinePoland
