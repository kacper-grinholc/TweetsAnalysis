🇬🇧|At the #EU border between #Poland and #Belarus, thousands of #migrants have again tried to storm the border fences. #Merkel phoned #Lukashenko and offered humanitarian aid. 2015 started the same way. #Europe has to live with the result. #ID 
Nothing happens on the #border without the participation and approval of the Belarusian services that coordinate the migratory pressure on #Poland.   @MON_GOV_PL : The migrants were equipped with stun grenades by the #Belarusian services and attacked #Polish soldiers and officers

@JackPosobiec The West is in crisis. It is good that there are still such countries as Poland.  I prefer Poland defending its nation and security, rather than CNN madness!  Folks watch #Poland and learn how to stand for your land!! #HoldTheLinePoland
