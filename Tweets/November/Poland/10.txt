@EU_Commission is considering addition sanctions on any companies involved in trafficking migrants to #Belarus who are in turn moving towards the border with #Poland. Russian company #Aeroflot and Turkish #TurkishAirlines are amongst the companies under risk.
Polish police &amp; border guards stand near barbed wire to stop #migrants (who were camped just across the border in Belarus, amid a tense standoff on the #EuropeanUnion's eastern border ) from the #MiddleEast &amp; elsewhere gathering at the Belarus- #Poland border near #Grodno ! 
@AmadiTiba It is a shame for the #EU that the people lie helpless in the forests between #Belarus and #Poland. Likewise the people in the camps in #Greece and the drowning people in the #Mediterranean. A GIANT DISEASE! Frau von der Leyen has to do something about it, tonight!

#Polska #Pologne #BelarusBorder  Wanda Traczyk-Stawska (94) fought in the Polish resistance against #Nazi tyranny during the Second World War.  Today she is resolutely opposed to the new #nationalism in #Poland &amp; the current #refugee policy.  👉An admirable fighter for #humanity. 
Refugees from #Afghanistan, #Iraq and elsewhere are encouraged by #Belarus to come there.  And then there are sent to #Poland, a #EU member, to provoke a crisis.  Meanwhile, the #refugees are kicked around in the cold amid this geopolitical game.

Judging from #EU's wrong reaction (more sanctions instead of their relief) it's moderately certain that the migrants crisis on the #Belarus-#Poland border will last for many months, president #Lukashenko can't help migrants on Belarusian territory in these circumstances.

Worse and worse on the border with Belarus. The doctor gave a shocking report  #belarus #poland
Although Obviously the White Population of #Poland will be Larger than the White Population of #Taiwan, (But their are a Few White Ppl in #Taiwan too), &amp; like I don't necessarily think that All #TaiwanesePeople are bad or Racist really, I think their are some Good Ppl there. 🤔🤷‍♂️
"Danger of local escalations" at the #Poland-#BelarusBorder" says former Polish Defence Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz.   Could a rise in tensions be exploited by Belarusian or Soviet propaganda?⤵️ 
So.... #EU demonstrates unprecedented solidarity to #Poland vs #Belorussia for protecting "European borders". On the meantime #Turkey occupies 40% of an EU member-state, #Cyprus, and have sent millions of refugees/immigrants to #Greece. Yet EU funds Turkey with billions of €.... 
Not that the Black Population of either #Poland or #Taiwan is that Relevant Economically, (Or Militarily for the most Part for either Nation), it's just interesting IMO that #Taiwan Actually Ended up having the Larger Black Population, (Even tho ur Obviously there for the Ppl).

Also even when I was Studying about the #DemographicsOfTaiwan, (Which Alongside the #DemographicsOfJapan &amp; the #DemographicsOfThePhilippines 2 Countries I Study &amp; Store Data on my Computer), I found Out something interesting about 🇹🇼#Taiwan Relative to 🇵🇱#Poland too! 🤔😮😄🤓🧑‍🏫👌

So that being said? I think that #Taiwan is an Objectively better Country than #Poland is, (Pound for Pound), where the Issue or Subjectivity might lie is in the People &amp; the Culture sure, (As well as it's Geopolitical Position in terms of Defense), but thats about what I think.
#Belarus #Poland #Border #Kuźnica  #BorderCrisis   "camping" means:  no water, no food, no humanitarian or medical aid -  temperatures dropping below 0 C° 
As for Economy? #Taiwan is also Wealthier than #Poland is, (So the Advantage isn't just In Military with a Smaller Population, it's also this Area as well), #Taiwan is the 21st Richest Country/ Economy in the World &amp; #Poland Ranks 23rd! 🤔🤓🧑‍🏫🤷‍♂️❓ -&gt; 
Although #Taiwan is actually also Spending more on it's Military these Days than #Poland is as well, (So if anything the Gap Militarily between these 2 Countries might even grow more &amp; more overtime), + #Taiwan is a Closer Ally to #Japan so u can see why I'd like it more. 🤔🤷‍♂️❓
&amp; It's not just Military right? #Taiwan's Infrastructure &amp; Education System I believe should likely b alot better as well than #Poland's, (Bcuz of it's IQ), So I don't only think its going to be because it Can Produce more with Less Militarily either, #Singapores another Example.
@visegrad24 EU Observer: “Minsk airport data showed on Tuesday that Turkey's national flag-carrier, Turkish Airlines, was still flying migrants from Istanbul to Minsk … despite the border crisis”  #IstandwithPoland #Turkey #Belarus #Poland 
#UNICEF re: the instrumentalization and pushback of children on European borders #Belarus #Poland 
Because 🇵🇱#Poland's Population is: 38,158,000 (As of July 31st 2021), &amp; 🇹🇼#Taiwan's Population is: 23,430,948 (As of September 30th 2021)! So No Doubt #TaiwanesePeople are Smarter, &amp; u can See Average IQ Level Here too! 🤔😮🤓🧑‍🏫📊📈👉 -&gt; 
Tomorrow at 12pm, the CMS #Research #Colloquium will welcome Prof. @FlorianUrban_ of the #Glasgow School of #Art, who will tell us about his latest book "Postmodern #Architecture in Socialist #Poland". Find out more at: 
Just a reminder.  Right now thousands of Polish solders are defending the #EU from a flood of illegal immigrats. Yes, #Poland is defending YOU! Moreover, it is not racist to protect your borders. #PolandHoldTheLine #BelarusBorder
Altho #Taiwan Managed to Have a Military that is Marginally Stronger than #Poland's, (With Almost 30% Fewer Ppl), So it goes without saying that the Ppl of #Taiwan Have Higher Average IQ's tho, (Which Obviously I already knew too). 106.47 vs. 96.35, &amp; are the Closest to #Japan.
#Poland's border looks like a Nazi concentration camp.  So much for those @EUCouncil  human rights. I guess they're hoping the children will freeze to death and solve their problem.
the border with #Belarus, we are starting to deal with an #invasion of #green men like in the #Crimea - assessed General Roman #Polko. That is why #NATO should take a position on this matter, the eastern border of #Poland is also the border of NATO. 
Latushka: Belarus trains Afghan veterans to attack the Polish border   #belarus #poland
&amp; Militarily already, both 🇹🇼#Taiwan &amp; 🇵🇱#Poland are Comparable Right? 🇹🇼#Taiwan Having the 22nd Strongest Military in the World &amp; 🇵🇱#Poland Having the 23rd, (According to #GlobalFirePowers Website)!  🤔😮🤓🧑‍🏫📊📈👌 -&gt;  
&amp; Also for National Defense I'm Honestly Not sure which of the 2 Countries is Superior u know? Because both Countries need &amp; Rely on the #US, (#Poland with #NATO), &amp; Obviously #Taiwan is a Hotly talked about/ Contested Area in the World because of the Moves China is Making. 🤔🤷‍♂️
#Poland: On the border with Belarus, we are starting to deal with an invasion of green men like in the Crimea - assessed General Roman Polko, former commander of the GROM special unit  #belarus #russia @envirosec @ESteenhoven
Loekasjenko and Putin.. have a cup of your own poison you use on your opponents so we can clean up your humanitarian mess! Shame on you, every big nasty conflict Putin is involved. Krim, Syrea, Belarus, Georgia, Afghanistan.. #putin #Belarus #poland #EU
Altho its tough/ a Close Call right? Thats not to say that I don't still like #Poland, #PolishPeople or the #PolishCulture in general right? &amp; Certainly for #EnglishProficiency, (Even tho both #Poland &amp; #Taiwan are Great), I think #Poland will Still Edge it Out 4 being in #Europe
#Poland: Complete closure of the border with Belarus? Such a scenario is possible  #belarus
Although as I was Saying a Few Days back, (Not sure if it's been up to 1 Week or Longer yet), I would also be trying to learn as much as I can about #Poland as well, (&amp; then Report back on some of my Findings for that), but Now I think I'm Starting to like #Taiwan more. 🤔🤓🧑‍🏫
The crisis on the #Poland-#Belarus border is not like previous migrant crises, and it just takes a look at a map to see why. That border area is not on any normal route between MENA and prosperous EU countries. Someone is facilitating and directing that movement of people.

Former ambassador Latushka draws bleak future! #Poland "Next, Lukashenko will go for a local military conflict on the EU border, and in the meantime he will sell the picture to the world about a humanitarian crisis, the Europeans being to blame," 
@ManfredWeber @EPPGroup Mr. Weber, you said: "I applaud #Latvia &amp; #Lithuania for their management of this attack. We call on the Polish government to do the same and work together [...]" What is difference between #Poland and #Latvia/#Lithuania? Your #prejudice against #Poland? Could you overcome it?
Speaker @ratasjuri to Marshal @elzbietawitek: we stand in solidarity with #Lithuania, #Latvia and #Poland, we will continue to support them in the crisis situation and we will use all diplomatic tools to stop the attack:  @KancelariaSejmu #polandbordew 
@visegrad24 Thank #Poland for that.  Or #God!
Firmness and unity, good values. #EU #Poland #migrationcrisis 
#Putin  propaganda If the illegal economic migrants don't want to wear bin bags to keep warm, don't want to beg for bread &amp; water all they have to do is NOT to come or just turn around &amp; go back home. Instead they use violence, terrorise #Poland on the way to #Germany &amp; complain.
