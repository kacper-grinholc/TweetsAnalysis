#Ukraine national arrested after U.S. authorities tricked him into crossing the border into #Poland- he wrote the #REvil #malware code, a virulent #Ransomware strain that infected 175,000 computers worldwide, generating $200 million in extortion fees.
The #EuropeanCommission has inched up #Poland’s economic forecast for 2021 and maintained its previous forecast for the country’s GDP growth for 2022, adding that Poland’s economy would be the #EU’s first in terms of GDP growth. 
The situation at the Belarus-Poland border is not only a migration and political crisis. It's a humanitarian crisis that requires a global and immediate response. #Belarus #Poland #migrants #Europe #USA #saragiussani #HumanRights #StandUp4HumanRights
While Belarus threatens to cut off gas to EU and accumulated middle eastern migrants on the Polish border, Putin is amassing Russia’s armed forces on the Ukrainian border. The Bear longs for past glory and destabilized Europe. #Cdnpoli #Ukraine #Poland

Gerhard Palitzsch had worked in a succession of concentration camps since 1933.   He killed all 151 Poles on November 11 1941 at Auschwitz.  He would later boast of shooting 25,000 men, women and children at the camp.    #Poland #genocide #history #ww2 #OTD

11th November 1941  The Nazis mark Polish Independence day by executing 151 prisoners in Auchswitz.  Gerhard Palitzsch summoned Polish prisoners by their numbers and had them all shot in the back of the head at the "Death Wall".  Read more:    #otd #Poland 
#Poland &amp; #Lithuania have sheltered the Belarusian opposition in self-exile. Backed by the Kremlin,  #Lukashenko is taking revenge by flying in #refugees from the Middle East and shunting them to its borders to engineer a humanitarian crisis.

@P_Fiala Good luck from #Poland 👍🇵🇱✌️
#Poland &amp; #Lithuania do not escalate! I repeat: don’t fall for this, even if today’s polls trick you to… Lukashenko "what if we halt natural gas supplies? Therefore, I would recommend the leadership of Poland, Lithuanians and other empty-headed people to think before speaking” 
Come on #Poland and #Belarus. Why are your hearts made of stone? You'd rather watch children get sick from the cold, starve and even worse, at your doorstep? Is it pride or ruthlessness or lack of empathy or all those?

#Poland regained independence in 1918 because Polish were united. Poles sacrificed their lives for the benefit of others, instead of fighting imaginary enemy as many of the right wing do today. If the Nation is united, it will never be divided!   @YouTube

As the crisis on the border between #Belarus and #Poland escalates, harrowing stories are emerging of the brutal conditions migrants have endured on their journeys, with some going without food or water for days and others surviving vicious beatings along the way. 
“Together, we express our #solidarity with #Poland 🇵🇱 and #Lithuania 🇱🇹 and stand ready to discuss further measures that we can take to support them (…). We will remain united and determined to protect the #EU 🇪🇺 against these hybrid operations by Belarusian authorities.”
Looks like Germany and France don't understand that now Lithuania and Poland are defending their borders... Those migrants have no plans to stay here if we let them in to the EU territory BTW Happy independence day to #Poland Tough days ahead
Tensions escalate at the #Poland-#Belarus border as #migrants face dire conditions. #PolishBorderCrisis
I visited 4 ships so far today. They had crew from #Philippines, #Poland, #Burma, #Lithuania, #Bulgaria, #Ukraine, #Romania, &amp; #USA. I spoke a bit with the Romanian 2O of the 2nd ship. His name is Andre, &amp; he'll be going home soon for Christmas.
Belarus soldiers are cutting Polish wire border fences at night, aid workers say. These deaths are on #Belarus and the Aid organisations not #Poland. 
Precisely why relying on other countries for energy, food, water etc is mad.  Each nation should be as self sufficient as possible. Just because there are good relations, safety &amp; wider peace doesn't mean that will always be the case.  #Poland #Belarus

It’s depressing how entrenched anti-#refugee sentiments are. We condemn people for seeking a better life. Unless you’ve been a refugee yourself you’d never understand the fear and uncertainty. We humiliate refugees and blame the victims instead of the system responsible. #poland 
⭕️🇵🇱#Poland’s President stated that the armed forces of the country are on the highest readiness alert and is prepared to respond to any actions of #Belarus

#Russian propaganda. The illegal economic migrants from the #MiddleEast stranded at the #Polish #Belarus border are there from their own free will. They don't need to be there. They can go home. Instead they want to go to #Germany via #Poland. Their are masters of their own fate.
