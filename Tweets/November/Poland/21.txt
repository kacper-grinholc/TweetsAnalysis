Conservative/right wing/free market views on the rise in #Poland. No one in the audience is surprised. Good night. 
@Shafiqmog @tristangrayedi @AssedBaig The Polish soldiers didn't do anything to @AssedBaig. The #Poland-#Belarus border is a war zone. Get real, man. Some 20% of the "refugees" are Middle East militants hired by the Lukashenka regime. We can't care less about your flawed perception. 
Tensions are rising at the borders of #Belarus and #Poland as refugees gather. In response to #EU's potential #sanctions, #Belarus is threatening to cut the route for #naturalgas to Europe. Prof. @nandosigona joined us with his insights.  Listen again🔊🔊
European states are flouting the very ancient laws of hospitality. The #refugees and their own citizens are excepted from these by the same token. The former lose everything. But who will tell the loss of the latter? @Collectif_Mimmo #Poland #Greekcamps #Calais @parwana_amiri 
#Greece authorities are trying to drown the refugees . They clearly as it shows on the video opened fire recklessly towards the refugees . And also it clearly shows They were beating them up with large rods #RefugeesWelcome #Poland #Europe #Australia #AsylumIsHumanRight 
“Countries like #Germany, #Czech Rep and #Poland who (...) are considering #coal phase out dates well after the needed 2030 end for coal in Europe should take note: not choosing ambitious phase-outs will leave you playing catch up as they happen anyway”

100percent accurate. Belarus and Russia have weaponized these desperate migrants and families from Iraq, Kurdistan and Syria. Russia and Belarus are using these poor people as missiles and tanks and ammo. It's disgraceful #poland #PolandHoldtheLine #Belarus #BelarusBorder #Russia

For #Belarus, #Poland's neighbor, to watch idly at a crisis launching from within its territory is very odd behavior. It's like in a detached house where the neighbor just sits &amp; watches even as fire rages next door. EU is right to rush in to aid Poland.
#Poland is right  to protect its border.  Migration involves a formal process of application, vetting, etc. otherwise people could just go to where they want to live &amp; plop themselves there. Poland's existing policy re migration is a separate matter to the event at its border.
The "#migrants" are victims of human trafficking (involving travel agencies, etc.) thus it's the scammer-human trafficker that should be called out &amp; primarily responsible for the mess &amp; pay for immediate needs of their victims now trapped at #Belarus-#Poland border, in limbo.
Crisis being exploited w #Poland accused &amp; pressured by int'l orgs invoking human rights to welcome the "#migrants" else suffer public censure. But, clearly, in this instance these "migrants" aren't really migrants nor are they refugees.
It makes me so angry and sad ... Shame on #Belarus shame on #EU shame on #Poland, shame on #Putin!

@_JakubJanda I'd agree however the prime minister of #Poland is also friendly with Putins bought far right troyan Le Pen.  Can one put faith in such double faced #EU chameleons? #Schröderization
#Books help us make mental journeys. The student Joris van der Does wrote the first published #travel account by a Dutchman to #Poland. His Latin journal was published in Leiden in 1599. The image comes from the #Dutch translation from 1652 #history (Rijksmuseum RP-P-1884-A-7937)

#Synektik Fiscal-year 2020/21 results: Revenues - PLN 128.6m vs. our estimate PLN 126m, EBIT - PLN 10.1m vs. PLN 11.2m, net income - PLN 8m vs. PLN 8.8m. If we do not account for the cardiac tracer, the stock seems fairly valued at present. #Poland #Healthcare
