This is #Poland , member of the #EU , in November 2021 @lopcute   All because the dogma's of the Catholic church are still dominant in that country and have poisoned politics there 
In most countries, these issues were settled long time ago. In Poland, women must fight the RC church and government against continuous erosion of their rights. #Poland #anijednejwiecej

Situation on #Belarus - #Poland border continues to deteriorate.   Historically, Belarus was not a popular migration route, not least because Minsk enforced very strict border &amp; visa rules.   Minsk also cooperated with EU on enforcement.   Time to return to the status quo ante. 
@alarm_phone They didn't choose well asking for #Asylum in #Poland. Andrzej Duda is a wannabe dictator, or at least that's his party's gameplan. He won't welcome foreigners much less #Refugees from a neighbouring country. Not that he'd welcome refugees from anywhere.

Warsaw streets still hold the messages from yesterday’s march when thousands protesters took the streets in memory of  30-year-old woman, who died in the 22nd week of pregnancy after septic shock - result of the near-total ban on abortion. #Warsaw #Poland #anijednejwiecej 
This year, for the first time in history, an individual used #Poland’s “Holocaust Law” to sue in a civil court. The ruling threatens research that reveals the role of ethnic Poles in the persecution of Poland’s Jews.

#Poland cannot be thrown out of the bloc as there is no legal mention of such occurrence, but the #EU can decide to impose sanctions if they feel Poland’s actions are unsynchronous with Brussels, explains @rahulkamath23.

This is what happens when ideologues and religious fundamentalists take control or are given control. The vow to protect life amounts to even more death and suffering. Humanitarianism and humane religion give adults freedom of choice and enable them to choose responsibly. #Poland 
#NovakDjokovic was crowned season-ending world number 1 for a record seventh time. The #Serbian #Tennis superstar had previously jointly held the record with #PeteSampras but took sole possession when he won against  #Poland's #HubertHurkacz in the semi-finals of #ParisMasters. 
“If this had occurred before that ruling, Izabela would still probably be alive,” said @ippfen's Irene Donadio about the first recorded death of a woman as a result of a court ruling last year virtually banning abortion in #Poland. #AniJednejWięcej

We truly are ruled be the civilisation of death, and we must do something — we can’t let #Poland stay a murderous country. The more we hit ‘em where it hurts, the better — the very least is to strike and protest. #anijednejwiecej

More Polish judges were suspended this week for doing their job: applying EU law &amp; European Convention of Human Rights in their country.  We wrote a letter of support and solidarity to them, while  @vonderleyen @dreynders @VeraJourova have not. #ruleoflaw #poland @GoodLobbyProfs 
“I am lying and waiting, either something happens or I will die.”  She died because 'pro-life' policies denied her the right to a safe #abortion. In memory of #Izabela, and in solidarity with those marching in #Poland. #abortionishealthcare #MyBodyMyChoice 
I’m not at all surprised when women say they’re afraid to be pregnant in #Poland — such tragedies show we live in a country that essentially legalised murder. The “pro-life” people support life so much they’re okay with killing women. 
After the death of a 30-year-old pregnant woman in hospital, protests have sparked across #Poland against the abortion law 
In celebration of #8November #Victory Day in #Azerbaijan 🇦🇿 Embassy to #Poland launched  🖼 competition themed “My free #Motherland”. It was inspiring to receive so many interesting art works from talented young artists from all over Poland.

People drown in the #Mediterranean. People freeze to death at #Poland #Belarus border. We - Europe - let them die. As a journo, I was privileged to go to these places &amp; speak with people at risk of dying. They are humans. They are kind. There are children. They are just like us.
