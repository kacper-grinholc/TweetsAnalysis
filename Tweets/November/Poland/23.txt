Migrants are "dying in the snow" along the #Belarus-#Poland border, caught in freezing temperatures between hostile border guards from both countries and cut off from life-saving aid. IRC's Stefan Lehmeier in @axios: 
The sad truth about our external EU-borders is that while we were cheering on #Poland, #Lithuania &amp; #Latvia these last few weeks, #Italy has welcomed probably more illegal migrants into the EU via the Mediterranean route than were stopped by the 3 Eastern border states combined. 
Organizations such as the #EU &amp; #NATO, which are based on the principles of democracy, freedom, and human rights, should not allow member states such as #Poland, #Hungary, &amp; #Turkey to violate their charters with impunity
