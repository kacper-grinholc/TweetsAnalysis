“The world is in anything but a stable condition,” Angela #Merkle tells the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  Poor Europe. Their best leader about to go; dependent on #Putin for power; #Poland and Hungary fed up with their own EU membership; and little #Macron running amok.
Tragic. Avoidable. Almost 9 years to the day that Savita died in Ireland, another life lost because a vital medical procedure was unnecessarily &amp; cruelly withheld due to draconian #abortion laws. May her memory inspire change &amp; legal access in #Poland 
Could a fed-up #Poland – Hungary too - do a #Brexit from the EU?  Or stay inside to stymy the EU’s agenda with vetoes?  No wonder little  #Macron is so bad tempered these days. Had hoped to replace Angela as undisputed leader of the #EU - but fights erupting every way he turns.
