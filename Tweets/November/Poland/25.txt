Poland Doubles Down in its Fight Against European Law   via @impakterdotcom #EUlaw #democracy #Poland
@GalinaAksakova As I've written repeatedly, there's no doubt about #Belarus's brutality. But that's an easy sell in the West. There the problem is complicity with the massive brutality of #Poland.

For Western useful idiots of PiS Poland's brutal nationalists: @OlafScholz  "While #Belarus manufactured this situation w/o regard for the human consequences, #Poland shares responsibility for the suffering.” Belarus/Poland: Abuse, Pushbacks At Border  
Social media platforms accused of contributing to crisis at #Poland-#Belarus border, creating an increasingly dangerous situation for those trapped in the area.  @franakviacorka @astroehlein @Cernovich
The left in @Europarl_EN is doing the same thing all over again. They keep on fabricating unfounded political accusations against right-wing governments, and disguise them as rule of law issues. #Hungary, #Poland, and now #Slovenia. Anyone can be next. Such a shame! #eplenary 
European plans to move away from coal are gaining momentum - but #Poland is standing in the way  Ember's latest research shows that Poland will be responsible for 63% of remaining EU coal generation in 2030, based on the latest national plans.

💬#Zakharova: We urge #Poland to take necessary action to stop the unlawful use of force against the asylum seekers who were blocked at the Belarusian-Polish border.   ☝️We hope international human rights organizations will give an adequate assessment to the actions of Warsaw. 
@AlarKaris We, the citizens of the EU don't give a shit about what happens in #Russia and you the Presidents of #Poland, #Lithuania, #Latvia and #Estonia should focus your attention on the citizens of the EU and not on those from a non-EU country.
From 1 January 2022, the Polish Sejm will implement KSeF, the National System of e-invoices and taxpayers will have the ability to issue structured invoices.   Read more on the implementation of KSeF here:   #Poland #EUVATNews #VATNews #KSeF #e-invoicing 
Similar to 🇲🇰, 🇵🇱 didn't make it out their group at #Euro2020 - the only loss in WC qualifying coming in a 2-1 defeat to 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 at Wembley, where a late Maguire goal was needed to settle the tie.   Last 3 away results:  1-4 W 🇦🇩 0-1 W 🇦🇱 1-7 W 🇸🇲  #Poland #WCQ2022
@hiiuyankee Bonjour, you can read it here: We, the Presidents of #Poland, #Lithuania, #Latvia and #Estonia…  Share this if you think it's interesting. 🤖
@Sachinettiyil Each of the countries whose modern forms were shaped by Christianity should declare Christ to be King, for the universe is in fact a divine monarchy, and earthly governments are at most a pale reflection of his. #Poland is setting the pace for humanity right now!@TaylorRMarshall

As #Belarus uses #illegalmigrants against #Poland to force remission of #EU sanctions, so #France uses #Channel #migrants to force #UK #Govt to comply with its #fishing &amp; #trade demands. State sanctioned #blackmail by both Belarus &amp; France costing migrant's lives? 🤨 #criminal
#Poland's Constitutionnal Tribunal struck again yesterday. This time it's against @ECHR_CEDH. Amazing to see the "plasticity" of the Polish constitution, how it can be "reinterpreted" in ways it never ways before.

#Poland #PolandHoldtheLine  It's clear to me, these immigrants aren't refugees they're really criminals and also supported by the Belarusian military to force the invasion. The worst thing is that the EU still doesn't call for a coalition in the face of these acts of war.

At Bruzgi-Kuznica border crossing, #Belarus-#Poland border, irregular migrants from the Middle East held a #protest rally to demand that they would be given right to proceed to #Germany.  Another confirmation that these are economic migrants, not genuine asylum seekers.
