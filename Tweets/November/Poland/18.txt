The deadly game at the #Poland #Belarus border went too far for at least 13 people (who died as a result) and for the many who will suffer permanent physical or longterm mental consequences. What has been going on raises serious #HumanRights questions‼️ 
What's happening lately on the borders of #Poland and the treasonous and timid response by #EU proves beyond any doubt that the only result of the Second World War has been to reduce Europe to the object of extra-European powers and interests.

@AFP The media should always mention that airlines are facilitating this current #migrants crisis in Belarus.  #Russia and #Belarus are weaponizing the migrants in their war on the #EU and western democracies. #Poland

Imagine trying to order iced tea from a waiter in Kraków, #Poland, just after the fall of the Soviet Union. You are sure to get chills when you read the tale in this month's Funniest Thing.  #internationaltravel

#Poland is prepared to go to war to save its national identity, unlike Britain, swamped by Arabs/Muslims beyond recognition. No longer 'English' 
@oulosP Authoritarian regimes should be condemned and denounced. #Spain, chooses to please them instead. #EU should wonder who their true allies are.  Very voiceful at condemnig #Poland &amp; #Hungary, but violation of human rights againts #Catalan and #Basques by #Spain are forgotten.
#Poland, you gotta love it;  Arab migrants  asserting theirs sense of entitlement cut no ice with Poland; water cannon, freezing to death, anything to stop them flooding into Poland. That's the way it should be. 
#Belarus on Thursday said that there were around 7,000 migrants in the ex-Soviet country, with around 2,000 of them camped on the border with #EU member #Poland.

Exemplary not only for the region, but beyond.   In EU MSs like #Poland or #Hungary, public broadcasters have turned into state mouthpiece. @RSF_en have declared press “state of emergency”. 1/2

Terrible! #BelarusBorder #Poland #Belarus 
@guyverhofstadt What is unbearable is to see you in the high ladder of EU politics! Belarus services are pushing for more tensions at the #BelarusBorder. This isn't provocation but a clear call for #war with #Poland! #Putin and his puppet dictator should be sanctioned for this outrageous action
