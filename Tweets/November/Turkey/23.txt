Happy Thanksgiving! The museum will be closed on Thursday November 25 and Friday November 26 for the Thanksgiving holiday, and will resume regular hours on Saturday. See you then!  #acrm #compustory #thanksgiving #celebrate #turkey 
#Breaking  Turkish People: "When, if not today". "We will no longer bow to hunger and poverty"    #Turkey #Erdogan 
Yo! There in #Turkey, if the money are not enough, cut a piece of Mavi Vatan and bring it to the dinner table. 
It is unfortunate that the #Arab world faces double aggression from #Iran &amp; #Turkey, but there is a way forward: full reconciliation with #Israel, closer relations with #Europe, substantial democratisation, geostrategic multilateralism, and #investment in #CuttingEdge #technology
Protests in Turkey over Lira collapse #Turkey #OSINT 
#Tonedeaf: @PressSec thinks a $1 more for #Thanksgiving #turkey is nothing but she doesn't realize it's not just turkeys that are #costing more for the #American ppl. Other traditional Thanksgiving items are also more expensive including gas to get  wherever you're going. 
Why scaling investment is crucial for sustainable development  #Turkey  RT @WEF
Turkish People are called to the streets by saying "When, if not today". "We will no longer bow to hunger and poverty"   #Turkey #TurkeyLira 
My thoughts: If @EU wants to stem a new wave of Iraqi refugees, it will need to address core issue of state failure in #Iraq.  #Iran @UNIraq #Qatar #KSA #Kuwait #Turkey #UAE #Kurdistan #العراق #السعودية #قطر #الامارات #كردستان  #الكويت #البحرين  My
Turkish #Lira sinking is a bad news; Every time Lira crashed, #Turkey started #Military campaign or #war against  neighbors; diverting attention of citizens from local corruption and failure towards "external" enemies.  🇮🇷,🇮🇶,🇸🇾,🇦🇲,🇬🇷,🇨🇾,🇱🇾 watch out.
