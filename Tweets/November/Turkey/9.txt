🎧 In 2016 #Turkey falsely accused Prof. Barkey of planning a coup. Five years later, these charges have upended his life. @hbarkey joins our podcast to discuss this ordeal and #Turkey’s false accusations, which are based on outlandish conspiracy theories:  
German Press: Turkish and Russian governments facilitate smuggling migrants to Belarus and from there to Poland - EU. #Turkey #Russia #Belarus #Poland #IstandWithPoland 
"If Turks hope to enjoy unhampered trade with Central Asia all the way to the Chinese border, then Armenians in Artsakh should enjoy the same unhampered trade through #Turkey all the way to France or the United Kingdom," writes @mrubin1971.   
@mrubin1971 #Azerbaijan and #Turkey already have a corridor through #Georgia. So, #ZangezurCorridor is more in #Armenia's own interest to break out of isolation. Open communications create opportunities for all competing regional interests. And by the way, #KarabakhisAzerbaijan!

The visit of UAE's FM @ABZayed to #Syria confirms UAE's plan: - hedging: it wants to minimize its loses in Syria - it wants to develop relations w/Damascus in order to secure a better position to limit #Turkey's &amp; #Iran's influence in the country.
#NATO stands in solidarity with #Poland. And this the correct stance. A year ago, the alliance was absent when an identical case involving members, #Greece and #Turkey, emerged. Credibility takes years to be built and a decision or two to get destroyed.

#Mitsotakis has just confirmed #Pushbacks and said "put the blame to others not us" when a #Dutch journalist said that #EU left #Greece alone during the #Refugee crisis.  He meant #Turkey but given his hysteric reaction we could interpret EU as well
Why has #UAE decided on public raproachment with Assad?   1-Teaming up against political Islam and the Moslem Brotherhood (Team #Turkey )  2-Realizing that the more #Syria stays isolated the higher is #Iran ‘s influence in the country
According to reports, maj of migrants trying to cross from #Belarus into #Poland are Kurds. Could #Turkey be trying to kill 2 birds with 1 stone? Destabilise Europe &amp; empty Turkey of Kurds? It has followed same policy by settling Kurds in occupied #Cyprus. #DemographicEngineering

Three years ago, the United States removed #Turkey from the program that produces F-35 jets, following Erdogan’s decision to buy defense missiles from #Putin. #Erdogan can no longer be trusted now that he is in Putin pocket.
