Demirbag (AKP) told citizens to eat only ½ a kilo a month instead of 2 kilos of meat. Instead of 2 kilos of tomatoes, 2 pieces might be enough. At the beginning of the month, Energy Minister Dönmez advised turning down the heating. #Turkey gives me Cotton-Qandil 2012 flashbacks.

Happy #Thanksgiving from Eco:Logic!   Let’s talk #turkey. It takes about 8 kWh of energy to cook your Thanksgiving bird and 14 kWh for the whole meal!   Reliable access to energy powers the holiday; enabling us to share a meal with loved ones and stay warm in the chilly weather. 
Is it time for #Thanksgiving  #Turkey pictures yet?  Cooking my light and dark separately this year.  But they’re ready to go.  Can’t wait!
