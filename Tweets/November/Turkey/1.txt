🎧 @CFR_org expert @stevenacook joins our podcast to analyze @POTUS's meeting with #Erdogan at the #G20RomeSummit and look at the broader challenges in US-Turkey relations including the S-400s, #Turkey's request to purchase F-16 jets, and human rights:  
Great piece by @SelimKoru on what elections mean in #Turkey and the delicate position the opposition as it heads into the next ones, where it is beginning to feel it can dislodge Erdogan (and hope that by projecting the belief it can make it reality). 
Whether it's a church, a cathedral, a museum or a mosque  (it's been all four at various times in history), #Istanbul's Hagia Sophia is spectacular. #Turkey #Travel 
Its doesn’t make any different on the ground . Why do the US Gov. &amp; the   @UN @antonioguterres ignore to impose Global Arms Embargo against #Ethiopia ? The genocidal regime import weapons from #UAE #Turkey #Israel not from the US
