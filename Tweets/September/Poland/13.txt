@markets Let's put it clear. Without #RuleOfLaw no #EU funds for #Poland.  Zero. Nada. Niente, Nix. Rien.
The foreign and defense ministers of the #Baltic states and #Poland have gathered to discuss a joint response to conventional and hybrid threats as #Russia and #Belarus staged large-scale military exercises, involving a massive 200,000 military personnel.
@BloombergAU Without #RuleOfLaw  no #EU funds for #Poland. Zero. #judiciary
"the Poles put up much more of a fight than Germany likely expected." True! #Poland #IWW2 
The word shocking is not adequate to describe what should be popular outrage that a dictator like #Lukashenko of #Belarus can use Interpol to persecute democracy activists and human rights defenders even in #Poland #StopInterpolAbuse #HumanRightsViolations #FreeBelarus 
Excellent expert blog on the most recent developments in Poland’s rule of law crisis. @EU_Commission has asked the @EUCourtPress to issue financial sanctions according to Art. 260 TFEU against #Poland for the non-compliance with the Court’s injunction on the disciplinary chamber.
