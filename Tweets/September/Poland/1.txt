@Mortis_Banned It is completely false in any case. The people who talk about the #Nazi-#Soviet alliance to crush #Poland in 1939 are the same people who talk about the betrayal of #Czechoslovakia in #Munich in 1938 &amp; the folly of appeasement of aggressive dictators. Both are talked about.

In the wake of the Afghanistan debacle, how does the backsliding of some former Eastern bloc countries like #Hungary or #Poland into quasi-authoritarianism involve American national interests? I don't see any point of a #DemocracySummit, which isdue in December this year.

@CDPROJEKTRED_IR The company released Q2/21 figures, which are significantly above PAP consensus (on net income level, the actual results is more than twice as high as the cons estimate). My feeling is that the worst is behind $CDR....#Poland #gaming
&amp; #Hungary is a Country with a Population, (Just Shy of 10 Million total), &amp; #Poland Has just Over 38 Million People, so Obviously #Hungary is going to have the Better #Japanese Population Density as well, (Since it's a Smaller Population &amp; also Has Smaller Cities). 🤔😄🤓🧑‍🏫📊📈
Additionally #Hungary's #Japanese Population is the 3rd Largest in #EasternEurope, so theirs that too! (Similar amounts to #Poland Around 2k), though I have read Marginally more Positive Reviews about what it's like being Black there Compared with #Poland tho, Fair? 🤔🤷‍♂️❓

@LutherBurgsvik No need for Duda to mandate. Those who lived through Communism &amp; saw its last days in #Poland were some of the first to roll up their sleeves &amp; bring their 12-15 year olds to be jabbed.   Why mandate when the overall mindset in PL is compliant to the State.
In #WW2's opening salvo, #AdolfHitler's armed forces attacked Poland OTD in 1939. With an assist from the USSR, Germany decimated the country's archaic military, controlling #Poland within a month. As agreed to earlier, the Nazis &amp; the Soviets divided up the conquered nation.

1 Sept 1939: World War II in Europe begins. Unprovoked, Nazi Germany invades #Poland at 4:45 a.m. The first attack came from the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein on Westerplatte, followed by a ground invasion. #WW2 #WWII #history #HistoryMatters #ad  
82 years ago #Germany invaded #Poland, 17 days later Soviet Union joined in partitioning Poland. 2WW started. To large extend this was a consequence of a failure of European diplomacy marked by #Locarno and appeasement of Germany. Diplomacy matters

September 1, 1939 Germany invades Poland kicking off World War 2.  The war would rage until the summer of 1945, involve almost every country on Earth and kill 85 million people. It would alter history forever.  #WW2 #Poland #Nazi #Invasion
