Ru... sh! No shortages in #Poland of any stuff. All shelfs fully stocked. Making roads less save as #Brexit  - god luck with that. Remember HGV are about 40 t. bullets on roads. Changing measures to Imperial won't change the physics. 
Our transport secretary proubly tells us #Germany and #Poland have a worse #HGV crisis.  Any truth in that?  #Deutschland #Polonia
