👏 @RobertaMetsola for this very clear position on the media freedom in #Poland. It’s the current government that is pushing the country away from the #EU, not the polish citizens. 
President of #Croatia said that while he disagreed with #Hungary and #Poland on many issues, he agreed that the #EU cannot be a superstrate or a federation but a club of nation-states. Eastern and Western #Europe have a different idea of what #Europe and the #West mean.

There's an illegitimate, vertical attempt to bring down the conservative government in #Poland and replace it with one that is socialist in character. This is pursued every day using the #RuleOfLaw as the excuse.  🗣️ ECR MEP @NProcaccini | #EPlenary 
The media's objective is to inform people, not please politicians. It has to report the truth not serve politicians. This must be valid in every 🇪🇺country, incl in #Poland. The Polish government must not be an obstacle for the Polish people enjoying their #EU rights &amp; benefits.
Checks &amp; balances of the democracy in #Poland were affected and they have to be restored. The attacks on the functioning of the judiciary institutions and now on the independent media are against #EU values. This has to stop! Institutions must serve the people not politicians!
"#Poland’s place is not on the sidelines of Europe..the fight for democracy &amp; freedom did not end with the revolution...   Don’t move further away from the ideals that moved a continent only a generation ago. That changed the world. Come back"  My speech to #EPlenary today: 🇪🇺🇵🇱 
During #EPlenary debate on #Poland, I said that the 1st priority of EU institutions is to defend #EU values. #MediaFreedom &amp; #RuleOfLaw tops the list. Today's discussion on EU values in 🇵🇱is a clear signal there's a problem. @Europarl_EN is on Polish people's side &amp; wants to help
