#Poland and the #Baltic countries have accused the #Belarusian government of pushing migrants, most of them from the Middle East, across their borders in an effort to destabilise both its neighbours and the #EU. #Poland calls for more sanctions
I also find interesting regional patterns: There is a much stronger correlation between support for differentiation and identity in #Poland than in countries from other EU regions. The reason may be the strong right-wing populist politicization of identity in these countries.
