A great digital investigation reconstructs a likely #pushback by #Poland forces. #Amnesty exposes the illegal practices of border forces when denying the right to #asylum. 
The truly dangerous nature of #Poland's state of emergency is now even clearer. A number of journalists have reached out saying that they wanted to go to the border but couldn't get access. Our digital investigation has begun to fill that gap but access/oversight urgently needed.

#Poland is right to defend national borders against fakefugees seeking to cross from #Belarus.    #Greece is right to defend against fakefugees coming from #Turkey.   The first duty of government for every sovereign nation is defence. That means defending the borders.
Poland’s govt must end pushbacks, urgently provide adequate shelter, food, water &amp; medical care to the group of Afghans stranded at the #Poland/#Belarus border, &amp; ensure they can access Polish territory  This is an obligation under EU &amp; int’l refugee law.
#EU law guarantees the right to claim asylum, yet #Poland, an EU member state is blatantly violating their rights .   The EU must act swiftly and firmly to call out these flagrant abuses of EU and international law.
