In MARCH 1917, BOOK 3 the forces of revolutionary disintegration spread out from Petrograd all the way to the front lines of World War I, presaging Russia‚Äôs collapse. #Solzhenitsyn #Russia  Pre-order the next book in THE RED WHEEL epic today!  
On 17-19 September #Russia will hold parliamentary '#election' not only within its national borders and at diplomatic missions abroad, but also in Russian-occupied territories in #Georgia, #Moldova &amp; #Ukraine, where more than 3 million people issued with Russian passports reside: 
$14,000,000,000,000 $14 trillion damn dollars. And they still let #Russiaüá∑üá∫, and possible #Chinaüá®üá≥, take the lead in #hypersonic weapons. And by the time we catch up and deploy our own ‚Äúworking‚Äù hypersonic weapons, Russia will have developed defensive systems against them! 
In its communist past, #Russia had made enormous contributions to #India‚Äôs infrastructure. The cultural imprint of the friendship of our nations is deep rooted in both countries, points out Vladislav Voytsekhovich. #IndiaRussia 
The de-escalation zone in northwest #Syria is subject to a Russian-Turkish ceasefire agreement signed in March 2020; however, the area witnesses frequent mutual bombardment despite the entry of the ceasefire into force. #Turkey #Russia #Idlib #HTS  
#Russia has allies in both eastern &amp; western #Libya. These allies may go to war against each other but both need Russia &amp; both will lobby to prolong its occupation. This catch-22 that the EU &amp; US find themselves in was expertly &amp; openly designed by #Putin.
#Russia - ,#EU relations to deteriorate if EP does not acknowledge elections. EP's FAC suggested that EU prepare for non-recognition of the results of State Duma elections if Brussels considers that they were held in violation of international regulations
