#Russia's Communist Party predicted to slash government's majority in first exit poll after voting in parliamentary election ends  #
Bad #poll from #Germany: Growing majority is for rapprochement with #Putin-#Russia (blue lines). Our compatriots are either already caught in the Kremlin lobbyism of #Merkel &amp; Co. or are rediscovering their inclination towards authoritarian regimes. Disgusting and worrying.

@anders_aslund Saying that #Russia has declared a gas war, while ignoring that #USLNG supplies to EU have fallen versus the highs, is the definition of selective reporting. Feel free to consult credible sources like @ira_joseph @platts @tmarzecmanser @SStapczynski
Where are the results of the electronic votes? Why have they not been published? How can @AP predict something when the electronic votes are not published? #RiggedElection #Russianelections   #Russia  #freeNavalny

Russia election: Vladimir Putin's party expected to secure emphatic win as polls close   Imagine the shock !! #Russia #Putin 
With just 9% of ballots counted nationwide, the Central Election Commission said United Russia had won 38.57% of the vote.  #Russia | #Elections2021  
In Saint Petersburg and other regions of #Russia , deranged #Putin regime enforcers are even storming some polling station in an attempt to arrest everyone there, complete madness 
Writing a paper on the 2016 election... Thought this would be fitting. #Facebook #Russia #propaganda #MEMES

As the extent of the failure of Putin regime at its own , completely controlled, “election” becomes evident : the #Putin regime enforcers are completely off the rails , assaulting and arresting poll watchers and local election workers which rejected falsifications. #Russia

@AP The assault to democracy in Russia started with the Bolshevik coup in 1917. Not sure why the officials even bother. #Russia #History

The #RadicalLeftist @SecBlinken @PowerUSAID are the enemies of #Africa. They are transferring their hate and fear of #China and #Russia onto #Africa. They are losing ground across the globe so they think they can rule #Africans. #US #ThisIsNot1860s #Africans #nomoreslaves

Surprised ‼️ The ruling United #Russia party, which supports President Vladimir #Putin, is on course to win a three-day parliamentary election, initial results and an exit poll shows. 
UPDATE - #Azerbaijan Defence Ministry stated that #Russia's quoting of #NagornoKarabakh authorities for ceasefire violation is surprising and regrettable. Azeri authorities determined that their side did not open fire. (1)  1.  #armenia #karabakh 
Early limited results in #Russia show pro-Kremlin party leads. Now that’s a blinding flash of the expected. No way that #Putin would allow non-anointed candidates to win. 
Good News, India 🇮🇳 could buy a 9.9% stake in #Russia's Novatek LNG 2 project in the Arctic. Russia-India relations must advance in Economic and security cooperation. This is the need of hour. @MEAIndia @RusEmbIndia
As polls close in #Russia, election watchdog @golosinfo concludes that the # of violations were even greater than in previous elections. Record-breaking “carousel” voting and turn-out “anomalities”. Reports of detention of independent local observers as polling stations close.

Well…if you look at the Moscow Times, the CPRF may just have their best election since 1999, and may get their highest showing in the popular vote since the collapse of the Soviet Union! #Duma #dumaelections #Russia #Election2021

So why does #Biden crush the #KXL pipeline that would bring oil from US friend #Canada - then ask #Putin / #Russia for #oil? What are we not being told? #Hunter have an 'in' here too? Admires the #dirtypolitics ? 
@bbclysedoucet Thanks to the agenda of #UK and its ally, the new motto of #west is #death to #AfghanGirl education. Destroying #Iran, #Pakistan, #India, #China, #Russia is far more important then 30 million innocent who are shouting for 2 centuries that we are friend with both sides.
@JoeBiden The forces of Good vs Evil have found themselves at a Crossroads in the battle for the future of our planet. It is time for humans to evolve as a species. We must understand that #greed is no longer an option and that scarcity does not exist. #China #NorthKorea #Russia #fear 4
Shocker: Pro-Kremlin party leading vote with only 38% in manipulated parliamentary elections, the Kremlin having poisoned, jailed, banned, criminalized &amp; otherwise suppressed any meaningful opposition in #Russia. And w/ a last minute assist from @Apple @Google @YouTube @telegram

Elections &amp; ‘cleansing’ before them in #Russia were mockery &amp; farce. Worst is that manipulation of democratic instruments has become norm in that country. Key question- to what extent world is ready to tolerate all this. At least, results of ‘elections’ should not be recognized.
