@selim_selimi Sure. It's just a term that has been coined in academia to describe such relations, hence in quotation marks. But to go back to the initial tweet, the unconditional obedience remains interesting to observe. Even #Abkhazia shows, at instances, less obedience to #Russia.

#Putin hopes that the #Kremlin‚Äôs United #Russia Party retains its dominance in the parliament after the vote. The party currently holds 334 seats out of 450. - there are so many reports of violations including ballot-stuffing, inadequate security &amp; pressure on election monitors.

#Russia's Communist Party predicted to slash government's majority in first exit poll after voting in parliamentary election ends  #
Bad #poll from #Germany: Growing majority is for rapprochement with #Putin-#Russia (blue lines). Our compatriots are either already caught in the Kremlin lobbyism of #Merkel &amp; Co. or are rediscovering their inclination towards authoritarian regimes. Disgusting and worrying.

Early limited results in #Russia show pro-Kremlin party leads. Now that‚Äôs a blinding flash of the expected. No way that #Putin would allow non-anointed candidates to win. 
Good News, India üáÆüá≥ could buy a 9.9% stake in #Russia's Novatek LNG 2 project in the Arctic. Russia-India relations must advance in Economic and security cooperation. This is the need of hour. @MEAIndia @RusEmbIndia
As polls close in #Russia, election watchdog @golosinfo concludes that the # of violations were even greater than in previous elections. Record-breaking ‚Äúcarousel‚Äù voting and turn-out ‚Äúanomalities‚Äù. Reports of detention of independent local observers as polling stations close.
