Recently the #Kurds have held high level talks with #Russia, and all of a sudden Russian jets are hitting terrorist targets near #SDF lines. This is too much of a coincidence

@zachsdorfman This: CIA's #MikePompeo was seeking revenge on WikiLeaks/#Assange: Also This - Per Assange's lawyers: Agent/Congressman Dana Rohrabacher “on instructions from Trump, he was offering a pardon or some other way out, if Assange … said #Russia had nothing to do with the #DNC leaks.”
Lavrov Says Taliban Recognition 'Not on the Table' | TOLOnews  Now that #Russia has achieved its aim of forcing the #US out it has little incentive to recognise the #Taliban. But it is the people of #Afghanistan that pays the ultimate price.  #Resistance2  
@HillaryWarnedUs Something I always remind people: #Russia was hacking the 2016 #GOP primary as well. They found more success there because #KGB knows all about #PsychologicalWarfare, and #Republican psychology is already predisposed to goosestep toward fascism.

A thread with my two-pence on Russian elections and society: (1) In the aftermath of #Russia elections many of us Russia-watchers are understandably concerned with the forensics of fraud as Rodion Skovoroda and I were when we exposed last digit fraud in Putin vote in 2012. 
💥Today is the International Day for the #TotalEliminationofNuclearWeapons 💥 ☢️ Read our article online:   by @sbidgood  #nuclearweapons #armscontrol #GRIT #US #Russia #coldwar 
Now that there is less money available for distribution to citizens, because of the shrinking economy, and more falsified votes given to United #Russia, the regime is getting more repressive. 
To be very honest, #India is in an extremely disadvantageous position in the current geopolitics. #USA chooses #Australia as the key military ally in the Indo-Pacific, not India. #Russia is aligned with #China. Both Russia and USA feel #Pakistan is a better partner in Af-Pak. 
#Kremlin spox says #Putin regards #Russia's Duma [federal assembly] elections as "very competitive, transparent, honest and fair."  Right. Everyone knew pro-Putin United Russia party would win overwhelming majority of seats -- no matter how electorate actually voted.
