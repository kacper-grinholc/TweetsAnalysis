6/6 #Russia has thereby gained considerable influence in the #SouthCaucasus without having participated in the war. It now controls communication routes and the armistice line. It gained a strategic control position through the #Karabakh War in 2020 without having fought.
4/ #Armenia is still dependent on #Russia since it still has a remnant territory of #Karabakh which it would also lose without Russia's support so that it still needs Russian protection.
3/ The victory in the #Karabakh War in which Russia did not intervene on the side of the Armenians made it domestically possible for #Aliyev to draw closer to #Russia without being considered a traitor.  He is no longer dependent on #Turkey alone and his clan is strengthened.
1/ #Putin's #Russia has gained considerable influence in the #SouthCaucasus. By Phillipp Ammon via @theeuropean  Russia withdrew military support from the Armenians in #Karabakh without intervening militarily on the Azerbaijani side.

#India was not a direct participant in the #Doha talks. India was also not part of the #TroikaPlus mechanism, but as I said, these mechanisms have not yielded d right results. I think one lesson is that it is better that India &amp; #Russia work together with respect to #Afghanistan.
This is what happens when the war criminal #Assad is not held accountable for his crimes against humanity, instead #Russia delivers more weapons and ammunition to use on the people!
The Western world’s policy vis-à-vis #TigrayGenocide has been different from that of #China, #India, #Russia,&amp; #Africa. This’s explained by the role of values in foreign policy. But the lack of a meaningful action by the West also means that interest almost always trumps values.

@ashoswai When the #Taliban #Mujahideen helped the #UnitedStates against #Russia, they were Mujahideen, but when they stood against the United States, they became #Terrorists. The West is always hypocritical  #ImranKhan 
The #EU condemns the searches in the illegally annexed #Crimea by #Russia which resulted in the detention by Russia of five #CrimeanTatar leaders (Eldar Odamanov, Aziz Akhtemov, Nariman Dzhelial, Shevket Useinov and Asan Akhtemov ) and up to 50 people.

In the last few hours, since the announcement of #Taliban Government in #Afghanistan, #China  has not reacted beyond two 'mundane' tweets. Unlikely to be 'happy' with this Cabinet. More likely to go with #Russia 's conditions. Wait and watch!!! 
Trade in arms is amongst the most significant drivers of #Russian policy in #Africa. According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, #Russia exported 18% of its arms to Africa between 2016–2020, highlights @rajenharshe.

Very sensible analysis. Russia has no time for the "End of American hegemony" myth after Taliban victory in Afghanistan. Rivals' eyes are sometimes sharper than those of several US hawks seeing withdrawal from AFG as permanent damage #USA #Russia #Afganistan

.@RSF_inter denounces excessive restrictions on #pressfreedom on the borders of #Poland &amp; #Lithuania with #Belarus due to influx of migrants &amp; #Russia’s military exercise. We urge both governments to allow journalists to report on the border issues which are of public concern.
