During the first wave of terrorist violence in #Russia (1878-82), the working classes had no sympathy with the educated terrorist-revolutionaries, seeing them as an oligarchic class that was angry with their Emperor for promoting and protecting the interests of the peasantry. 
The “red line” for us should have been the annexation of #Crimea by #Russia. It happened precisely because we (West) listened too much to Russia. Today, in case of #Ukraine joining #NATO, 🇷🇺 can do not much graver than it has already done. But we still won’t accept Kyiv.
