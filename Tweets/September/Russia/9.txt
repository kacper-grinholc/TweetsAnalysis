My latest: the #Taliban plans to invite high-level delegations from #China and #Russia to #Afghanistan. It also hopes high-level Afghan delegations can visit #Beijing and #Moscow, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen told GT in an exclusive interview.
#Russia asks the New York Times to correct fake news on #Catalonia.  Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakarova says Deputy Minister Oleg Siromolotov has never met with or had any contact with @josepalay.  @nytimes 
The governor of #Russia's northern province of #Yakutia, which suffered from widespread wildfires this summer, warned of the risks of a similar disaster next year if unusually hot and dry weather persists  #Wildfire 
Thanks to @__ARAZ_ for comments on the #pts. Re-reading Zakharova's comments I think he's right in retrospect. The key word here in her statement relates to discussions *in* rather than *between* Armenia and Azerbaijan. #Russia #Moscow
President #JairBolsonaro on Thursday said that he is signing bilateral agreements with the #BRICS partner countries, an economic group made up of #Brazil, #Russia, #India, #China and #SouthAfrica, during his speech at the 13th summit of this bloc.  
Hillary Clinton revealed that West/US created Mujahids in Paxtan. They paid and trained them to fight #Russia in Afg.   And then Mujahids became stronger, backfired, started taking control. Then #US/West got there to destroy them. But couldn't for 20 years.

#Russia Army "rebels" shelled an apartment bloc in Triokhizbenka (a frontline village on #Ukraine-held side of the #Donbas warzone), then waited a bit, and opened fire on a UA Security Service team that arrived to document the war crime. No casualties.
