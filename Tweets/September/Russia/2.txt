I, along w/ my colleagues in Congress, will continue efforts to stop #NordStream2 &amp; ensure #Ukraine is not threatened. Punishment after the fact has not proven effective in stopping #Russia’s malign activities before. NS2 will be no different. 
Unfortunately, in yesterday’s long-overdue meeting w/ @ZelenskyyUa, President Biden neglected to address the most pressing concern for Ukraine – the #NordStream2 pipeline. Biden’s promise to sanction #Russia if it uses NS2 to harm #Ukraine rings hollow &amp; will never be fulfilled.
In sum, #Russia is becoming an increasingly dominant player in commodities markets, sustaining its centrality in oil &amp; gas while drastically expanding grain &amp; meat exports across the 🌎  We can reasonably expect this position to be wielded as a diplomatic tool in the future 9/9
So what initially appeared to be a response to food insecurity (high reliance on imports) has become a potential #geoeconomic tool, as #Russia has become the world leader in wheat exports and other countries become increasingly reliant on food imports from 🇷🇺 4/9
