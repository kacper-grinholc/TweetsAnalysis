Be Ready: Next week asking for assistance in combating Russia's propaganda against #Ukraine on #YouTube. Focus on this vile individual Russell Bentley. From US, he pushes Russian propaganda in occupied Ukraine. His channel spreads hate-filled "harmful content &amp; misinformation" 
Alliances do matter. So does living in the present. #Ukraine should never forget where it wants to go, strive to be.   There's also a realization of knowing where you stand in life. Than living in a fantasy. Forcing a reality that isn't. From there Ukraine can defend itself. 
It's now clear that President #Zelensky's regime, at the very least, knowingly neglected #Ukraine's ongoing defensive war in #Donbas - funding corrupt construction megaprojects instead of basic defense needs. Many argue it's being done purposely: to ease capitulation to Russia.
#Ukraine's Defense Ministry didn't deny the fact stating that the servicemen's salaries where underfunded in the 2021 state budget. President's Office also acknowledged the fact, discussing it on today's Natl. Security &amp; Defense Council (RNBO) meeting.
BRKNG: #Ukraine's Ombudsman's Office CONFIRMS the fact that UA Armed Forces servicemen are massively owed overdue salaries, including the hazard pay for #Donbas war, to the whopping amount of UAH1.47Bn (~$54.8M).
Kremlin reports that Putin told his Finnish counterpart that #Russia would support reviving the spirit of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.  He might start by ending Russia's war against #Ukraine.

This is the track  "Through The Stream Of Eternity." It comes off the album "Fighting With God" which was released on August 29, 2021 by the  #Kyiv, #Ukraine #deathmetal outfit @hyperboreusband  Check it out .
Since March 2021, #Ukraine has been under the threat of a new large-scale military attack by #Russia due to the concentration of approximately 110,000 troops of the Russian Federation near Ukraine’s eastern borders and in the #occupied #Crimea.
Every week in Eastern #Ukraine, civilians are injured because of the violations of #IHL norms.  Fighters: get ready, next week our new training mobile application for soldiers about IHL will be available on all android phones.  Ignorance cannot be an excuse for war crimes.

It doesn't matter what people answer.  What I like most of all is that "mostly Russian speaking" #Kyiv breaks stereotypes - all the people in this video speak Ukrainian easily.   Thus, Ukrainian-language TV and media are doing their job very well. #Ukraine 
There is no place for violence in today’s world. @UNDP-led forum on domestic violence response unites best practitioners of law enforcement, courts, national &amp; local authorities to develop a common vision to stop violence in #Ukraine. ➡️  
Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksiy Danilov recently said that #Ukraine should switch from the Cyrillic alphabet to Latin and English should be the second language. We asked Ukrainians what they thought about the initiative. 
Huge and weird IF true: #Russia's special forces apparently adopt grey berets - 3 years after #Ukraine SOF did so. Symbolism is defeatist. Historical backgrounds very different. Also, some experts wonder if either country actually needed to create such separate force altogether.
