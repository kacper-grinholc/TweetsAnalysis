Transnistria is a major case of state impotence in both #Moldova &amp; #Ukraine. 8th year into the RU invasion of UA, many have been asking why the ludicrous 400-strong RU base there wasn't exterminated with artillery or blockaded into surrendering. (No, nuances don't matter here).
#Ukraine finally bans vehicles bearing license plates of the Transnistria (#Russia-occupied region of #Moldova) - massively visiting south-western UA regions on everyday business. The ban was agreed 1.5 years ago, but postponed by Moldova under Kremlin's pressure.

Given Kiev’s behavior. #Ukraine could become the Serbia of the 2020s. The Biden administration must not replicate the Czar’s folly and fall into such a trap.  Washington should cut Ukraine loose and let it fend for itself. 
Ukraine is both an unworthy and dangerous partner for the United States. Zelenskyy’s government not only has perpetuated the pervasive corruption that has plagued #Ukraine since independence, but it is also intensifying policies that undermine basic civil liberties.
