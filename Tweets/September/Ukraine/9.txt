#Ukraine is fighting COVID, the Russian invaders &amp; traitors working for Putin inside the country. Meanwhile, 2 Germans (my hubby's colleagues, they share the same project) are whining about the "very difficult life" in Germany, cause they have to work from home. The contrast 🤔 
Moscow with #Ukraine legit Central/Eastern European power and player: borders with Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. Major econ/other assets. Belarus adds Poland, Latvia, Lithuania/NATO facing, new UA flank, strategic depth but otherwise a significant net drain.
