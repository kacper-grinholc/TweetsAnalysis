According to #Zelensky, #Biden didn't smooth out the differences, and the presidents’ conversation was direct, “man-to-man.” The U.S. leader took a tough pragmatic stance and demanded effective action from #Ukraine, primarily within the country.  #USA #UKR
#Ukraine residents and entities hold [and circulate] untaxed unaccounted cash and valuables estimated at &gt;$50 billions in equivalent, President's economy advisor Mylovanov tells UA journos. 2021 UA state budget (expenditures) is roughly $50 billions as well.
