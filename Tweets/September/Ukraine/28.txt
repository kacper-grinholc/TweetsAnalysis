@steven_pifer You can bet the extra expense of shipping through South Stream will be picked up by #Moscow as a cost of doing war against #Ukraine, &amp; probably includes kickbacks to #Orban &amp; his corrupt cronies.

@LevHavryliv @nytimes says #Kyiv is the city from which “the Orthodox Church spread its influence through Russia.” In 988 was no “Orthodox church”, “Russia” didn’t exist till 1721. Yes, Orthodoxy spread from #Ukraine to the #Moscow backwater, but Muscovy later repressed Ukrainian Orthodoxy.

@ValLisitsa Two weeks ago, #Sheriff "destroyed" #ShakhtarDonetsk. Today, #RealMadrid fell. Having said that, if you look at Sherrif's squad, you would learn that no local players there. Only one player who is Brazilian with a passport of #Moldova. Even a head coach is from #Ukraine.

@DaleVince Only nation that blocked gas supplies to #Europe was #Ukraine... who charge extortionate transit fees. Reminder: Ukraine's coup in 2014 supported by #UK #US #VictoriaNuland @UnderSecStateP #JohnMcCain &amp; the #NeoNazi Azov Battalion in #Kiev (has it's own version of #HitlerJugend)!

Can see why #Ukraine is questioning #Hungary's decision to import gas from #Russia via South Stream instead through Ukraine -- sure looks like longer shipping and possibly more expensive route.  
Demand his release! Now. It is very absurd to continue to hold him after all the bs in politics from #Australia #US #UK #SaudiArabia #Afghanistan #Ukraine #China in the past few years. It was a mistake. 
Goodnight #Ukraine. But before I go, here's some Tuesday cheer. #YouTube has deleted 2 German-language Russia Today channels, with 600,000 subscribers (trolls). Looks to be related to them spreading #COVID “medical misinformation.”
