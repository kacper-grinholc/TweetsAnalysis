3. In the #Rivne region of #Ukraine, 51% of teachers have been vaccinated so far, and therefore only 187 educational institutions can work in person. In the #Kherson region, none of the universities can continue the educational process due to low #COVIDVaccination rate.
2. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, more than 25% of schools are switching to #distancelearning. In addition, two universities have gone online as well due to low vaccination rate among #teachers. Clearly, #Zelensky failed to vaccinate majority of educators in #Ukraine. #Covid19
1. Overall, #teachers in #Ukraine are not #FullyVaccinated , therefore schools, colleges will have to either remain close or do #distancelearning. In Ivano-Frankivsk region, 80% of teachers were vaccinated only in 123 educational institutions out of 1066.
