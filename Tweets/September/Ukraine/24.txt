@Vanessa_RN_ER We're looking to have a #RoyalCommission into #MurdochGutterMedia due to how damaging they are.  The #USA, #Ukraine &amp; #AUST all have a huge #MurdochGutterMedia presence &amp; look the effect it's had on our governments. I've no doubt #Trump would never have been elected without it.
@senrobportman You turned your back on #Ukraine in support of TFG. #Hypocrisy
  It has been a long time since I've read claptrap like this about #Ukraine.   Ukraine's EU membership faces one problem - money.  Ukraine's agricultural production would put a lot of #EU farmers out of business.  It's time the  EU owns up this.
That was always the narrative: full-scale #war between #Russia and #Ukraine

As #AUKUS shows, US &amp; other Western governments are primarily motivated by their own political &amp; national interests. Therefore, they did not heed Zelensky’s requests for #COVID19 vaccines, #NATO &amp; EU membership &amp; large financial aid for Ukraine. #Ukraine remains US client state.
