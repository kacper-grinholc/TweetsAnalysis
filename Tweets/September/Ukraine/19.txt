"Instead of focusing on #Ukraine’s accession to the #EU and #NATO, Kyiv, Brussels, and Washington should prioritize internal reforms and diversifying Ukraine’s foreign policy."   @eugenechausovsk provides policy rec's informed by his work in the region.  
@POTUS must return to status quo ante (before Trump) in which #Taiwan remains part of China’s #NearAbroad, thus, hands off.  US/NATO made a grave error in enticing #Ukraine to come under its umbrella knowing full well - that was a redline for Russia. We know how that turned out.

The media that refused to report on #Holodomor is the same media that refuses to report on #Ukraine today. This is why the skeptic's refuse Ukraine. Once Ukrainian's realize Westerner's skepticism of their own media, the message will improve. Its why blaming Russia is ineffective

Disgusting behavior from #radicals, #nationalists in #Ukraine. They gathered nearby the residence of Ukrainians opposition leader #Medvedchuk who is under house arrest. Thugs were protesting, intimidating the family of opposition leader. #Police didn't interfered.  Shame!

The mayor of #Uman #Ukraine is seeing in blue suit speaking at #Gonta Fest. 10 days ago, 30,000 Jews celebrated #RoshHashanah &amp; two days ago marked #YomKippur. And now Ukrainians are glorifying Gonta's name at the festival. He was implicated in #massacre of #Jews &amp; #Poles in 1768 
contract to law firm Skadden Arps? - let alone the fact that the firm is notorious for dishonest government work - like its recent crime spree in Ukraine. The difference between a negotiated rate and an “open-ended” rate can be substantial.  #legal #oligarchs #laundering #Ukraine
All-Ukrainian festival-competition "Gonta Fest" was held in #Uman. Mayor of Uman said "Competitors have come to us from all cities of #Ukraine. Festival "#Gonta Fest" is the best way to popularize Ukrainian art." Who was Gonta? @edolinsky @michael_brodsk  
Mayor of #Uman in #Ukraine is defending herself for not banning a TV crew from Ukrainian #opposition TV network "Nash" or "Ours" from broadcasting nearby a local pond. The mayor didn't give a permission for their gathering &amp; broadcast. The network criticizes #Zelensky policies.
@BillClinton like @DonaldJTrumpJr dad was impeached by the opposition party but wasn’t convicted by their own party in the senate. @MonicaLewinsky scandal and #Ukraine and #January6th should have been a convicted but #Democrats and #Republicans
