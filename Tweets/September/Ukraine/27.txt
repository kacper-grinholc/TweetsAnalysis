The Kremlin warned that any expansion of #NATO military infrastructure in #Ukraine would cross one of President Vladimir #Putin's "red lines", and #Belarus said it had agreed to take action with #Russia to counter growing NATO activity.

I am quoted here on #Ukraine’s President #Zelensky’s fake de-oligarchization efforts in the country. A thinly veiled show consolidating power in the hands of his oligarchic backers.

I am quoted here on #Zelensky’s smoke and mirrors “de-oligarchization” in #Ukraine. The “Oligarchs’ President” is helping his group of oligarchic backers consolidate power. 
The Ministry of Health has created a draft order on mandatory vaccination against #coronavirus of educators and officials, both at state level, as well as regional.  The relevant document appeared on the website of the Federation of Trade Unions of #Ukraine.

The self-proclaimed President of #Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, says he has agreed with #Russia's Vladimir Putin to "take some action" on the Ukrainian border. He stated that #US bases are being set up in #Ukraine, the website of the President of Belarus reads. 
In the physical reality, both #Poland &amp; #Ukraine significantly depend on trade with #Belarus. They actually procrastinate their necessary, and costly, military preparations for a likely #Russia invasion from Belarus territory. So far, only border guard is strengthened in both.
ICYMI, the tyrant of the #Russia dependency of #Belarus continues his COMPLETELY-UNPROVOKED war-mongering against #Poland and #Ukraine: PL is "deploying entire army corps along the border"; UA is "2nd front against us, with training camps".
