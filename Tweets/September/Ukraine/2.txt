.@ZelenskyyUa | We do not fear the dragons of autocracy in the #Ukraine. The people of our country love democracy and freedom too strongly to allow such threats to stay. The dragons will have their wings clipped by the rule of law.
Why do I love my job? It's the connections our team helps create. @SureFireAg @ShieldAg @farmada @KochIndustries #Ukraine #Kansastrifecta @KansasDeptofAg @suzzryan #FPS2021 
So the punch line to deny #Ukraine the @NATO membership a required fight with corruption. Is @NATO an economic alliance? Is it planning to start a business in Ukraine? Other @NATO members (esp. in the south-east) have no issues with corruption? Reason is fear of #Russia #Kremlin
Here comes an American commentator working at a Washington think-tank, publishing in an influential US magazine, and repeating talking points that the Kremlin has been spreading to justify its hybrid war against #Ukraine for seven years. @UkrStudiesForum  
Expert assesses the strengthening of "friendship" between the #USA and #Ukraine against #Russia  
I, along w/ my colleagues in Congress, will continue efforts to stop #NordStream2 &amp; ensure #Ukraine is not threatened. Punishment after the fact has not proven effective in stopping #Russia’s malign activities before. NS2 will be no different. 
Unfortunately, in yesterday’s long-overdue meeting w/ @ZelenskyyUa, President Biden neglected to address the most pressing concern for Ukraine – the #NordStream2 pipeline. Biden’s promise to sanction #Russia if it uses NS2 to harm #Ukraine rings hollow &amp; will never be fulfilled.

If you thought the hateful warmonger Mr. Zatulin was some marginalized ignorant radical novice MP from Siberia, NO: he's a veteran "academic" and "#Russia expert on #Ukraine" who's been paid &amp; media-promoted by RU government ever since 1990s, with extensive knowledge on Ukraine.
Week before the bleak #Zelensky-#Biden meet, a RU MP Konstantin Zatulin was aired live saying "#Ukraine is an enemy of #Russia, populated by people who are all responsible for betraying RU, state to be destroyed by Russia". Vid via OSINTer @den_kazansky
