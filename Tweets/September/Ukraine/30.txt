@Ginger_Kip @shustry What was wrong with the info posted by the Russian diplomatic missions? #US knows its, #Israel knows it, #Russia knows it, a civilized world knows it that #Ukrainians collaborated with the #Nazi. Seems only current  #Ukraine behaves like it was a lie. 
@StandWithUs It's a good move by #Ukraine's parliament. By having such law, it doesn't mean #Antisemitism will be gone. Let's see if #Ukrainian #police will investigate antisemitic incidents as #HateCrime or like they do in 9 out 10 cases as just "hooliganism" to lower true #crime stats.

@can_throwaway Thank for posting this thread about #BabiYar. Only one remark. It was no such country as #Ukraine back in 1930's or 1941. It was a part #USSR, it was a Soviet Ukraine. Those innocent people who were murdered were citizens of USSR, not Ukraine. Ukraine became independent in 1991.

@AlonUshpiz @michael_brodsk It's historic fact that local Ukrainians were collaborating with the #Nazi and were helping the Nazi to execute the Jews in #Ukraine and sadly in #BabiYar as well. That is something #Zelensky and current government doesn't want to bring up.
@JayDupes Ok, didn't see that. I'm expecting a little more from the #Ukraine Ice hockey federation to be honest.

"It was the band Talking Heads who once sang – Were on the road to nowhere… Well, due to Russia’s on-going occupation of eastern Ukraine, this region is full of roads that previously led somewhere."  #Ukraine is not Russia 
And #Ukraine's got another armoured artillery boat. Good to see its naval capacity increasing.

@poroshenko But my personal view is that #Ukraine doesn't need loans and assistance from #EU and #IMF. Without corruption and theiving oligarchy Ukraine's agricultural, metals, technological and other assets, it can export globally enough revenue to sustain it as a good #European state. 
#DistributedLab invites you to the main #blockchain event of this fall - #BlockchainUA, the tenth anniversary #international conference, which will be held on November 03, 2021 in #Kiev and will bring together the key blockchain community from #Ukraine and #Europe! 
@poroshenko Petro, perhaps you as President and your succesor, are conducting reform at a snails pace. As an oligarch perhaps it was against your own financial interest? Yourself and #Zelensky aren't doing what the majority of the good #Ukrainian people want, a better organised #Ukraine.

#Ukraine. The closed entry and exit checkpoints remain a key issue for the civilian population. The majority of persons who want to cross the contact line are women. 🇪🇺 regrets that Zolote and Schastia checkpoints are still closed on the non-government controlled side.

The eighth armored artillery cruiser was launched at the Kuznya na Rybalskiy enterprise in #Kiev #Ukraine, now it’s a matter of days until Crimea will be recaptured 😊 😭 
Also, this:   That Turkey is deepening defense cooperation with #Ukraine as Erdogan meets Putin sends an unmistakable signal to both Russia (I can be a pain in the neck) and the US (I can help NATO objectives, despite being a pain in the neck).

Is #Ukraine really going to celebrate the Day of Perun the pagan god? It's certainly possible. This would be a surprising revival for a deity whose idol was toppled in Kyiv in 988 when Rus' was christianised. You can still find devotees to the pagan slavonic pantheon if you look.
