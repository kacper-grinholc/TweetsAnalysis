#Turkey currently has a pending application to join the EU, we are urging the @EU_Commission to look into how Turkey is capitalizing on the genocide occurring in #Tigray. @JosepBorrellF @BorisJohnson @EmmanuelMacron @Haavisto #TurkeyDroneSale #ErdoğanGenocideAccomplice
#Turkey will only be contributing to the ongoing #TigaryGenocide by providing Military equipment including UAV drones to the Dictator regime of @AbiyAhmedAli. #ErdoğanGenocideAccomplice  #TurkeyDroneSale @GermanyNATO @UNPeacekeeping @StateDeptSpox @StateDept @USUN
#Turkey is amongst those countries that successfully continue the #pandemic process due to its state-nation solidarity, competent leadership, and strong organisational structure in its fight against #COVID19, says @kenantoprak63. 
The genocidal war against #Tigray has already seen 2.2M+ IDPs, a man-made famine, 80% of health facilities looted, vandalized or destroyed. #Turkey &amp; #Ethiopia has signed a military agreement escalating the war even more. @EUAmbUS @EUatUN @SecBlinken @StateDept #TurkeyDroneSale
Don't allow #Turkey  (#Erdoğan) to use #HKIA as the main center for  ISIS  activities in d region. 
Is #Russia using the #S400 against #Turkey @SemihIdiz 
#BREAKING: The TCMB reports #Turkey's official August inflation at 19.25%/yr. This is Turkey’s highest recorded annual inflation rate in 2 years. As Erdogan continues to recklessly insist on “low”interest rates, expect continued “high” inflation.
By assisting @AbiyAhmedAli with the #TigrayGenocide through the #TurkeyDroneSale, #Turkey is violating its commitments and responsibilities as a @NATO member state. @UNGeneva @StateDept @EU_Commission @EUCouncil
#Turkey ended quarantine restrictions on Pakistan.  #UK its your turn now.  End Quarantine.
@ElifAhmetTurkey Thank you 😊#turkey 🇹🇷
#Turkey, the last bastion of (almost fully) oil-indexed import gas prices is opening up to hub indexation after a spate of large #TTF-priced #LNG tenders and a recent #Azeri supply deal. The exchange, #EPIAS wants hybrid formula for new ref price. 
In a bid to continue his terror on #Tigray, @AbiyAhmedAli has enlisted the help of #Turkey through the sale of drones. The int'l community must intervene, otherwise countless more #Tigray|ans will continue to mercilessly die. @UN @SecBlinken @FCDOGovUK @EUCouncil #TigrayGenocide
#NATO member, #Turkey, is aiding the #TigrayGenocide by selling drones and armed warfare to #Ethiopia. All #NATO states must condemn the actions of #Turkey in the #TurkeyDroneSale. #TigrayGenocide
The Turkish gov't has previously denied its participation in systematically wiping out the Armenian people over 100 years ago. #ArmenianGenocide  Today, #Turkey is aiding the #Ethiopia|n gov in systematically wiping out the #Tigray|an people. #TigrayGenocide #TurkeyDroneSale
