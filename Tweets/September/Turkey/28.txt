#Turkey doesnt have the chanse to invade #Rojava militarily,thats why recruting agents among Kurds and increasing insurgancy was their most option   As the old Turkish intellegence staff,I Hakki Pekin said months ago,Turkey should increase terrorism in northwestern Syria(Rojava)
If the agents of #Turkey to be from Arab recruit, it would be so obvious, thats why they recruit their agent mainly from #Kurds within ENKS contact, in accordance of Turkish intelligence.   #ENKS has been demanding the release of its imprisoned members from Rojava administration

As quoted down here,#Turkey knows how to recruit agents and insurgencies in #Rojava. They are especially picking the one with #Kurdish ethnicity   To fire up Kurd vs Kurd situation in the region, they already have a lot of intelligence contact with the KDP's Syrian branch of ENKS

The #Turkish opposition is open to new talks on the Kurdish problem.  But they argue that talks should be done in parliament and with the HDP.  Read the recent updates on #Turkey’s core problem from ANKA Review.    
Fugitive right-wing mobster Sedat Peker has found a way to avoid the UAE’s social media blackout against him.   He shared his latest round of corruption allegations on #Turkey through a leftist journalist's Twitter account.

Kosovo’s new leaders, Prime Minister @Kurti and President @VjosaOsmaniPRKS , are not corrupt, and they must not allow #Erdogan to use #Kosovo as former leaders did, who gave all the country’s national assets to #Turkey. 
When you walk into The Turkey Grill, you breathe in the aroma of whole smoked and fried turkey, seafood gumbo, and smoked turkey breast sandwiches carved from the bone. Stop by to get a whiff and a taste! #Cajun #Turkey #BestSoulFoodInDetroit #DetroitEats

Hugely important military deal for both #France and Greece.   #Greece is buying warships from France worth around $ 3.5 billion amid recurring tensions with #Turkey. This comes after France lost a $66 billion submarine deal with Australia due to #AUKUS counter deal!

Mindset could change given how it touches on the anti-migration feelings in #Turkey right now.  Granted, RTE has tended to place more of the blame on #Assad for escalations there than #Russia, which may affect perceptions at home.

This has been a trend backed up by polling results for years now.  It does not mean #Turkey is looking to completely tilt towards #Russia but that its disagreements with it are not something Turkish citizens feel existentiallly threatened by.

Will #Turkey dare closing another missile systems deal with #Russia over sanctions and warnings from the #US?   "Turkey says it was unable to procure  systems from any NATO ally on satisfactory terms," while the US calls Turkey "an ally and friend."
