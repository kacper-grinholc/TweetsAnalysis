Turkish Central Bank may have to increase the interest rate again from 18% soon. ▶️Economist Fatih Özatay @OzatayFatih analyzed CB's latest rate cut decision for @YetkinReport   #Dollar #Turkey #Turkishrates #inflation 
A thread 1/n:  Today, #Turkey's central bank reduced its policy #interest rate. The 100bp reduction was a surprise, less so the reduction itself.  What is the reason behind such a policy that will lead to a continuous #depreciation of the Turkish #currency in the next weeks?
