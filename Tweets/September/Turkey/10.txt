#Idlib's economy now runs largely through #Turkey's currency -- managed by #HTS's central "Sham Bank."  #HTS earns $15-20million in monthly commercial customs duties &amp; welcomes Turkish fiber optic cabling &amp; electricity supplies. More info here: 
#HTS governance runs through its "Salvation Government" -- a semi-technocratic body that's facilitated a severe political (but not religious) assertion of dominance across NW #Syria.  It's also established monopoly control over #Idlib's economy -- thanks in large part to #Turkey.
