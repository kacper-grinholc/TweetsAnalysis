#Turkey do not support and speak up the #Tigraygenocide by providing the genocidal #Ethiopian government military support. There is no need to repeat the #ArmanianGenocide in #Tigray. 
How can the @StateDept_NEA,  @NATO and @UN talk about “human rights”as they stand idly by while NATO’s second largest military (#Turkey) continuously bombs refugee camps, hospitals and other civilian infrastructure in #Iraq and #Syria? 
“For #Turkey, who has wanted to plant a foothold in the #Gulf for years but was rudely rejected, this is an import achievement. Bec when the #UAE renews relations w Istanbul, it will also impact #Egypt’s readiness to normalize ties w Turkey, which it had called an “enemy state”
#Turkey made a big deal of #Khashoggi murder. @TC_Mogadishu It is rime to make #ikrantahlil murder equally big deal.
Saafi #Gaddafi has been freed and flown to #Turkey almost a hour ago. He was arrested in #Niger in 2011 and extradited to Libya in 2014. After the return of #Saif Gaddafi to the political scene, this is a new step towards the ancient regime... #Libya
“The pullout from #Afghanistan yielded another surprising alliance. The #UAE has been having a secret affair w #Turkey for months. After #Trump signed the withdrawal agreement w #Taliban, the UAE reexamined its relationships in the region.”
Read this thread! #CatsOfTwitter #Istanbul #Turkey 😻😻😻 
“Thanks to #Qatar, #Turkey continues to be the sole candidate for running &amp; securing the airport. The #Taliban’s acquiescence to discuss managing the airport with Turkey also stems from Qatar’s influence.”
