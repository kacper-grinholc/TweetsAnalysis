.@kenantoprak63 writes on how responding early to the possibility of a #pandemic, Turkey’s Health Ministry established the #Coronavirus Science Board on 10 January 2020, two months before the first case was even reported in #Turkey. 
Over 4,000 Greek businesses &amp; 3,000 Greek homes were destroyed. Diplomatic sources put the damages at £100 million.  As is the case with the #Genocides of #Armenians, Greek Pontians, Greeks in Asia Minor &amp; #Assyrians, #Turkey hasn't acknowledged this dark page in its history.
On 6 September 1955,the pogrom against #Greeks in #Istanbul/#Constantinople began. The attacks were organised by then PM Menderes in cooperation with #Turkey’s military &amp; deep state. It was essentially an act of ethnic cleansing, which led to Greeks' exodus from their fatherland.
