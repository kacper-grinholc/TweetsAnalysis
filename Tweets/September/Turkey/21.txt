The reckless acts of #Turkey in conflicts like the #NagornoKarabakh and #Tigray resulted huge damage in civilian lives that can amount into a genocide and a war crime.

The time to fight the expansion of Turkey will come soon, when internal resources run out, and the situation will be similar to the end of the 17th century, when Turkish troops unsuccessfully besieged Vienna. #Turkey 
Libya and the group of forces in Crimea logically fall. #Turkey is actively advancing, and #Russia is trying to avoid conflict, not because it is weak, but because it is very costly, troublesome, and at this time interval, passive defense tactics are more optimal.
