For #Qatar and #Turkey, contact with the Taliban developed in different ways.  As President #BarackObama's administration sought to end the war, Qatar hosted #Taliban leaders to discuss peace efforts from 2011.
#Turkey and #Qatar are closer to the region's Islamist movements, which frequently creates tension with powers like #Egypt, #SaudiArabia and the #UnitedArabEmirates, who see such groups as an existential threat.
@AbiyAhmedAli @KagutaMuseveni @PaulKagame @CyrilRamaphosa @MBuhari @AbiyAhmedAli But you wage a war against your own people.
