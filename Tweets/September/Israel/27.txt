76th United Nations General Assembly  Naftali Bennett, Prime Minister of the State of Israel, addresses the general debate of the 76th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations (New York, 21-27 September 2021).  #UNGA #Israel  
WOW, HISTORIC speech  #Iraq 🕊 #Israel 
#Israel's US &amp; UN Ambassador: “The international community &amp; Americans are starting to talk to us more about a plan B on #Iran. In the past, the estimate was that there was an 80 percent chance it would return to the deal," today it's 30%. 
At #UNGA, #Israel's prime minister calls #Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi "the butcher of Tehran." He cites eyewitness testimony saying when Raisi finished a round of murder, he would throw a party, pocketing the money of those he just executed, and sat down to eat cream cakes.
I thought #Israel's prime minister gave a strong #UNGA speech. Different from Bibi with lack of props. He didn't disclose any new intelligence. But Raisi's creamcakes, Shahed-136, &amp; "words do not stop centrifuges from spinning" all make cameo appearances. 
JUST IN: At #UNGA today, #Israel's Prime Minister @NaftaliBennett showcases Israel as a “lighthouse in a stormy sea, a beacon of democracy… eager to contribute to the world despite being in the toughest neighborhood on earth.” 1/13 
#Israel's Prime Minister @NaftaliBennett at #UNGA today: "Like the midas touch, #Iran's regime has the mullah touch. Everything place Iran touches fails."

#Israel acts real tough with their threats against #Iran &amp; #Palestine all the while knowing they would be nothing without the backing of #USA. Take that #IronDome away and see how tough they act. I’m sure their cowardly Zionist mouths would shut real quick👌🏽 #FreePalestine 🇵🇸✊🏽
Cartoon I made for @Mondoweiss about defunding of #Israel's Iron Dome is featured, along other skilled artists, on @ThePrintIndia website. Thank you!

#Israel #Bennett | In general, the PM spoke well at the UNGA. He wore a yarmulkah. He quoted the Talmud Yerushalmi. He mentioned Torah observance. He thanked the 38 nations who boycotted the Durban Conference. He warned the world against what Iran is doing.

#Israel is a multicultural and multiracial democracy. The rule of law is enforced equally for all citizens by it's Supreme Court. The accusations of #ApartheidIsrael would be laughable if it were not so insidious:  #FreePalestine from #Hamas  / #PLO / #IslamicJihad
