@POTUS @WhiteHouse Time to say enough is enough to the Racist Apartheid state of #Zionist #Israel  This is how they treat #Palestinians daily in their own homeland #Palestine worst than cattle to the slaughter house 😡 Shame on ANYONE that supports these #IsraeliTerrorists #BDS

@DanielAndrewsMP Is that so? How's that working for #Israel and #Singapore?
I thought that was what the vaccine was supposed to do - protect those that are vaccinated from #SARSCOV2 . Evidence from #Israel shows the delta mutation passes via the vaccinated.

NEW podcast episode | Why is the @UN so obsessed with #Israel?  @CliffordDMay discusses with @rich_goldberg, @AcrossTheBay, and @DavidSamuelMay: 
A Palestinian official told Zman Yisrael that the "new ambition" nurtured by #Israel Foreign Minister @yairlapid was "a new Oslo accord". This proposal was dismissed by PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh and #Hamas

Isn't that odd? If #Palestinians were legit, they'd provide all kinda evidence. Since they have nothing to prove they ever were indigenous to Ancient #Israel, they lie🤥 relentlessly, constantly...I conclude they wish they were #Israelis instead of Nazislamists🤭#PaLIEStine
