@JackPosobiec Hey EVERYONE! #Israel is on their 3rd Booster and it be getting bad still over there.
Hello @CNN and @BBCWorld what do you call this act of #Israel? 
"Netanyahu utilized diplomacy to create tension &amp; confrontation with those opposing his worldview. With the new government, #diplomacy is once again becoming a professional tool of dialogue, mending ties &amp; fostering the liberal democratic component of #Israel’s foreign policy.”
My interview with @PAXvoorvrede on the #foreignpolicy of #Israel's new government, with a focus on the mending of relations with #Europe, the divisions within the coalition on the #Palestinian issue, and the role of @Mitvim 
@UAEUSAUNITED UAE - built w/slavery, is friends w/ #Apartheid #Israel, is ruled by a tyrant whose population doesn’t have any semblance of free speech, who helps bomb #Yemen &amp; ghettoizes it, here pays monies to propaganda firms to whitewash horrific human-rights abuses.

🔹Bahrain’s main opposition group, the al-Wefaq National Islamic Society, has denounced Manama’s normalization of relations with Israel as “a crime,” emphasizing that the Al Khalifah regime’s policies do not conform to the will of the Bahraini nation. #Israel #normalization 
The national support is superior to the greeting #Hezbollah has received in 2006, following the #Israel/i war on #Lebanon.  Today, Lebanese people from all walks, not only Shia and their Christian strategic allies, supported the move Hezbollah has taken thanks to Iran.
"Palestinians want a state in Gaza West Bank and East Jerusalem" WRONG! #Israel 
If individual freedom of choice is not a hypocrisy in the world then #France should remove #BurqaBan, #Afghanistan must not force #Hijab,  #Switzerland should withdraw #MinerateBan, #India should not dictate people's food habit and #Israel must stop #Palestine occupation.
