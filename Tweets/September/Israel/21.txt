@RepTedDeutch Thank you for standing up for our closest ally üáÆüá±. The #US and #Israel have always benefited from our mutual alliance and sharing of crucial technologies. I believe that Israel has shared #IronDome technology with the US govt. The ‚Äòsquad‚Äô  &amp; @USProgressives are the enemy within.
1‚É£The shamble withdrawal from #Afganistan was the first sign. 2‚É£The delay in approving the military support for #Israel is now the second sign.
@Dwight9898 @salmasomething @Jack57494371 @StanleyCohenLaw There's no argument to legitimise Israel's activities &amp; they know it. They don't care. They treat the Palestinians like garbage. They want all of Palestine, with the Palestinians dead or compliant. #Israel is built on theft, greed,religious persecution &amp; bigotry.

@FutureDems Bravo, House progressives!  Well done.  The money is fungible. Less for Iron Dome means that #Israel has to take money from other aspects of its oppressive occupation regime that are more aggressive to pay for Iron Dome.  A good thing.
I'm terribly disappointed - but not surprised - to learn House Dems stripped funding for Israel's Iron Dome, a purely defensive system that protects civilians against rockets fired by terrorists. This is vindictive at a time when our ally and partner #Israel deserves our support.

@UrbanAchievr The Iron Dome isn't defensive. It would be if #Gaza too had an iron dome against @IDF bombing campaigns. As it doesn't the system simply gives immunity and impunity to #Israel and leaves #Palestinians defenseless. What is disgraceful is US support for Israel's illegal occupation.
This shows the dramatic shift of policy the US under Democrats &amp; the Biden admin have taken towards #Israel.  The Axis of evil is probably rejoicing now

Only 10 days post 9/11, this is playing politics with civilian lives in the face of #terrorism and frankly, having a cavalier/cruel view of the survival of #Israelis.  Shame on left-wing Democrats for denying #Israel the means (and implied right?) to defend itself with #IronDome:

Democrats hate #Israel. 
I think the current universe HAS BEEN morally inverted: in it, an occupier can impose a complete siege on a tiny strip and say it's defending itself when the occupied resists. As @4noura once said, #Israel is not protecting itself; it's protecting its domination. #FreePalestine 
@GOPLeader Re-word: billions of US tax payer money being pulled from financing the racist ethnic cleansing illegal occupying land thieving #Israel which takes pleasure in bombing &amp; killing #Palestinians as part of its 73 year apartheid system financed &amp; enabled by US politicians

Disgraceful. #Democrats won‚Äôt allow #Israel to defend herself against terrorist neighbors who seek to exterminate them. Absolutely gross. 
My support is still with the people of #Israel who has to endure the menace of being hunted once again, this time by the very state and government that was founded to protect them.  Shame on @IsraeliPM 
@RepStefanik You‚Äôre a laught riot. No money available for #USA healthcare or #seniors but pay for weapons for #israel? American #jews aren‚Äôt voting for the @gop, but nice try. This isn‚Äôt 1973, #israel has nukes &amp; plenty of cash, we‚Äôve done enough. they can defend themselves. @potus
Tomorrow: @SFRCdems hearing on nomination of @tomnides to serve as US ambassador to #Israel.
@RepAOC is trying to make sure the #irondome no longer exists. It‚Äôs 90% effective at blocking the short-range rockets used by Hamas &amp; other terrorists attacking #israel. The fact is, without it, #israel would not exist. @AOC keep your hands off the #irondome and üáÆüá±‚úåüèΩ
Just so I have this straight? We leave American hostages, $85,000,000,000 in military gear and millions in cash to the psychopathic head chopping camel piss aficionados in #Afghanistan but but $1,000,000,000 for the Iron Dome in #Israel is a deal breaker? Do I have that right? ü§î
@RepLizCheney Well, since Israel is US only constant and reliable ally in that part of the world, if #Israel were radically impacted by attacks and became incapacitated, that might be slightly problematic for the US  #SupportIronDomeFundingüáÆüá±

I'd like to see @POTUS and the administration immediately declare that removing funding for #IronDome -- a joint American-Israeli civilian defense project that saves innocent lives -- is completely unacceptable to the United States government and its foreign policy. #Israel

Do you want to let #Israel pay for her own defense? Then you should also let: Egypt  Saudi Arabia  Jordan Germany South Korea pay for THEIR defense. If you don't agree, you just may be an #antisemite. cc @RepAOC @RepRashida  @Ilhan @RepPressley @RepCori
.@RepSlotkin You can thank @jstreetdotorg which helped get you elected. To keep unfairly harping on #Israel &amp; lashing out at its democratically elected leaders, you and #JStreet had to expect this result! J‚Äôaccuse!! 
Contrary to what people may think, "Israel bad" is not a good argument for why it shouldn't have a lifesaving missile defense system specifically designed to protect civilians from rocket attacks.  #IronDome #Israel #Hamas
@TDanevirke And then #Israel threatened to recall their #ambassador, and then this happened.
