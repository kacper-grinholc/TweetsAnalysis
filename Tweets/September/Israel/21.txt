@RepTedDeutch Thank you for standing up for our closest ally 🇮🇱. The #US and #Israel have always benefited from our mutual alliance and sharing of crucial technologies. I believe that Israel has shared #IronDome technology with the US govt. The ‘squad’  &amp; @USProgressives are the enemy within.
1⃣The shamble withdrawal from #Afganistan was the first sign. 2⃣The delay in approving the military support for #Israel is now the second sign.
@Dwight9898 @salmasomething @Jack57494371 @StanleyCohenLaw There's no argument to legitimise Israel's activities &amp; they know it. They don't care. They treat the Palestinians like garbage. They want all of Palestine, with the Palestinians dead or compliant. #Israel is built on theft, greed,religious persecution &amp; bigotry.

I'm terribly disappointed - but not surprised - to learn House Dems stripped funding for Israel's Iron Dome, a purely defensive system that protects civilians against rockets fired by terrorists. This is vindictive at a time when our ally and partner #Israel deserves our support.

🚨🇮🇱The reports about #Israel pulling ambassador to the US over Iron Dome funding cut, are Wrong.   US will fund and is already funding the Iron Dome and the Jewish State, in many other ways.   FYI, the day that US unfriends Israel, that would be the End of American Hegemony.

@UrbanAchievr The Iron Dome isn't defensive. It would be if #Gaza too had an iron dome against @IDF bombing campaigns. As it doesn't the system simply gives immunity and impunity to #Israel and leaves #Palestinians defenseless. What is disgraceful is US support for Israel's illegal occupation.
This shows the dramatic shift of policy the US under Democrats &amp; the Biden admin have taken towards #Israel.  The Axis of evil is probably rejoicing now

My support is still with the people of #Israel who has to endure the menace of being hunted once again, this time by the very state and government that was founded to protect them.  Shame on @IsraeliPM 
@RepStefanik You’re a laught riot. No money available for #USA healthcare or #seniors but pay for weapons for #israel? American #jews aren’t voting for the @gop, but nice try. This isn’t 1973, #israel has nukes &amp; plenty of cash, we’ve done enough. they can defend themselves. @potus
Tomorrow: @SFRCdems hearing on nomination of @tomnides to serve as US ambassador to #Israel.
@RepAOC is trying to make sure the #irondome no longer exists. It’s 90% effective at blocking the short-range rockets used by Hamas &amp; other terrorists attacking #israel. The fact is, without it, #israel would not exist. @AOC keep your hands off the #irondome and 🇮🇱✌🏽
Just so I have this straight? We leave American hostages, $85,000,000,000 in military gear and millions in cash to the psychopathic head chopping camel piss aficionados in #Afghanistan but but $1,000,000,000 for the Iron Dome in #Israel is a deal breaker? Do I have that right? 🤔
@RepLizCheney Well, since Israel is US only constant and reliable ally in that part of the world, if #Israel were radically impacted by attacks and became incapacitated, that might be slightly problematic for the US  #SupportIronDomeFunding🇮🇱
@Roy_Iddan Well, since Israel is US only constant and reliable ally in that part of the world, if #Israel were radically impacted by attacks and became incapacitated, that might be slightly problematic for the US  #SupportIronDomeFunding🇮🇱

Important thread from a member of the US House Democratic Caucus who knows what she is talking about on Iron Dome. #Israel 
@i_am_me123 Especially when much of the world has a hard time recognizing that #Israel ‘IsReal’
#Israeli #Israel #irondome #Democrats  Democrats BETRAY Israel by Nixing $1B of Funding for their Iron Dome... Read the FULL story: 
@lbox327 Better if he stops genocide in #Yemen  #LiftBlockage and stops #CrimesAgainstChildren . The disgusting  tolerance and military business, financial help to #Israel. Shame for #IsraeliCrimes on children physically_ psychologically abused  #IllegalOccupation  #PalestineGenocide

I'd like to see @POTUS and the administration immediately declare that removing funding for #IronDome -- a joint American-Israeli civilian defense project that saves innocent lives -- is completely unacceptable to the United States government and its foreign policy. #Israel

I wonder what will happen to the weapons factories in the US if Israel decides not to purchase weapons ... 🤔 #vote #usa #irondome #Democrats #Republicans #condemn #antiisraeli #decision #sleepyjoe #JoeMustGo #factories #purchase #Israel #i24NEWS #i24NEWSEnglish

Do you want to let #Israel pay for her own defense? Then you should also let: Egypt  Saudi Arabia  Jordan Germany South Korea pay for THEIR defense. If you don't agree, you just may be an #antisemite. cc @RepAOC @RepRashida  @Ilhan @RepPressley @RepCori
.@RepSlotkin You can thank @jstreetdotorg which helped get you elected. To keep unfairly harping on #Israel &amp; lashing out at its democratically elected leaders, you and #JStreet had to expect this result! J’accuse!! 
Contrary to what people may think, "Israel bad" is not a good argument for why it shouldn't have a lifesaving missile defense system specifically designed to protect civilians from rocket attacks.  #IronDome #Israel #Hamas
@TDanevirke And then #Israel threatened to recall their #ambassador, and then this happened.
