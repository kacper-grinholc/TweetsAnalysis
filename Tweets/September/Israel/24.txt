Empty platitudes from @aoc recently about endless military funding and then siding with the pro-Israeli hawks in #Congress to siphon more money from US tax payers to prop up the #apartheid regime in #Israel. Voting present rather than no is a defacto yes vote, and she knows that.

@EUpalestinians And? Is #EU finally going to push #Israel to comply? It is not too difficult: block import of settlement products, suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement and introduce visa requirements for traveling to Europe (visa are  not issued to people living in illegal settlements).
At a time when all belief in  Biden's good will and competence is cratering in the US and worldwide, left and right, #Israel's Lapid/Bennett  entrusts the country's security to his hands.

@AOC, you have spoken out in support of #Hammas and against #Israel which by the way is a democracy. If you were living in an #Islamic country you wouldn't have any rights. Just look at the women in #Afghanistan who are being beaten, raped, tortured and murdered.
@PratikBorade1 Do see the Spy series on Netflix.. Well it even more impactful than Fauda #Mossad #Israel
Proud of this show that represents our #Israel family excelling on the world athletic stage!

The writer also justifiably points out that countries in the region that chose conflict and war against #Israel are in shambles and those that chose peace are prospering in comparison

Abbas said #Israel was “destroying the prospect of a political settlement based on the two-state solution” through its settlements on #WestBank land it captured in the 1967 war

@eifers1 @andrehendrik @ggreenwald I believe that the US (under the Biden Administration) sent foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority, the #UNRWA and maybe even Hamas in the Gaza Strip. What do we get back from these terrorist entities? NOTHING! #Israel is our partner in agriculture &amp; intelligence technologies.
@FriendsofAlAqsa So many innocent people murdered by #Israel.

Those in #Israel who have not been vaccinated against COVID account for 17% of the Israeli population. #CovidUpdates

@LeafandThistle The first instinct when they have screwed this up from the beginning is to CYA, even if it means data manipulation to maintain the narrative. Expect the same behaviour when real long term data emerges. #Israel

#PNA’s President Abbas at #UNGA76 gives #Israel one year to withdraw from the Palestinian territories it occupied in 1967, including #EastJerusalem, or face one binational state, instead of the two-states solution.    
If #israel is an apartheid state then what is “Palestine”? Do palestinians or muslims get killed for being what they are? No but Israelis and jews do have in “Palestine” what’s your argument now?
#AOC is a naive, ignorant, shallow, clueless, narcissistic, oblivious, #antiSemitic, #antiAmerican, #communist loving, stupid twat. I don't know what was more pathetic, her ugly dress or crying because #Israel got funding to defend themselves. #AOCSupportsGenocide @AOC @RepAOC
Pool of water near Dead Sea turns blood red, authorities investigating   #DeadSea #Israel  
True.  Then perpetual clueless #fraud, @AOC, shedding crocodile tears over the fact that Congress voted 420-9 in favor of providing #Israel funding to restore Iron Dome system (to stop terrorist rockets).  Same AOC who admitted she essentially doesn't know sh-t about Israel #SMH 
Previously, pro #Iran regime militias in #Iraq expressed opposition to Iraqi peace with #Israel. Only anti-peace argument was that Zionism would bring homosexuality to Iraq (not sure whether Squad are on side of Iran regime/Hamas or LGBTQ). Without Mullahs, peace chances rise.

Happy Sukkot and Shabbat Shalom from the Rothstein Sukkah! I hear that #Israel got some rain- not so great during Sukkot—but always welcome even so 🤤🇮🇱🌈✡️ 
@LKTuffaha @m7mdkurd Fake. No crater. Rockets cause a crater when they hit. Likely a grenade. Reputable weapons analysts have proven this story is a lie  @baparkr @sumayaawad #Palestine #Israel &amp; the #IsraeliTerrorism hashtag is a joke.
What was a small, inter-party squabble created enough agita in #Israel that Foreign Minister Yair Lapid spoke to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., about the issue. 
@LiseKorson @Daroff @SenSchumer @HalieSoifer @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @USProgressives She's in a tough spot. She needs the REgressives to pass Biden's Infrastructure / Social Welfare program. She is well-informed of #Israel's benefit to #America. But calling out the witches would hurt Nancy. And nothing's more important to Nancy than Nancy!
Sound ON !🔉 #Hebron #Israel  The Druze boy sheriff is partying with the residents of Hebron in Hebrew! Yes ! Only fools who doesn’t know anything and believe fake news or ignorants will say otherwise.  We’re not best friends with the other side but things are not as it seems
