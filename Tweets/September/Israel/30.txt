While I agree w/ @AOC on this one, it is a shame she doesn't apply the same standard to herself when she speaks about #Israel. Next time, Congresswoman, humility would serve you well when YOU attempt to legislate or prevent legislation about things you know nothing about.

21 years on, justice remains elusive for #Palestinian boy massacred by #Israel  #Palestine

THis is a not-so-veiled threat by #Iran in the direction of #Israel-#Azerbaijan defense cooperation. Some years ago, #Iran tried attack #Israeli officials in Baku.
