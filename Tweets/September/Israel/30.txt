#Breaking - Iron Dome funding has been blocked in the Senate by Rand Paul. #Israel #USA 
PM Bennett stressed unity between #Israel and the #Diaspora, stating, ‚ÄúWhen a Jew in Pennsylvania gets hurt, I hurt. When a Jew in France gets hurt, we feel the pain because we‚Äôre one.‚Äù
A Foul Play by Progressives Over Israel‚Äôs Iron Dome  #Israel #IronDome #ForeignPolicy #TheSquad #BDS #AntiSemitism
$20 Million is to be withdrawn from #EU funding to the #PalestinianAuthority  UNRWA "Palestinian texbooks‚Ä¶spread hatred against #Israel &amp; #antisemitism"   "changes must include improvements that promote with &amp; tolerance towards the Jewish-Israeli other"  REMARKABLE
Will the 36th government of #Israel confirm the covenant with "the prince of the covenant" #mbs? time will tell and the numbers are there. 666 is the 36th triangular, Bennett is the 13th PM (number of rebellion) and both of the surnames equate to #666 in the #satanic cipher. 
30, 9. 2021 ( I visited in the past countries like #China, Russia, India, etc. But they treated me far more better than the so called Democratic Germany my homeland, unfortunately. If a WW3 is coming I stand with my 2nd and better home #Canada and #Israel in my heart. 1 / 3

Has Ruth Wisse written a clarion call for defending liberalism in America, or a swan song for a generation of liberal Jews? ‚ÄúOne of America‚Äôs greatest thinkers‚Ä¶‚Äù - Ben Shapiro ‚ÄúA lasting work of profound moral force‚Ä¶.‚Äù - Cynthia Ozick  #jtwitter #Israel

While I agree w/ @AOC on this one, it is a shame she doesn't apply the same standard to herself when she speaks about #Israel. Next time, Congresswoman, humility would serve you well when YOU attempt to legislate or prevent legislation about things you know nothing about. 
You would think that #Iran building a presence close2 #Israel and #Israel building a presence close2 #Iran are kind of comparable.   But no, uproar in #Erbil - reports @amwajmedia 
21 years on, justice remains elusive for #Palestinian boy massacred by #Israel  #Palestine

THis is a not-so-veiled threat by #Iran in the direction of #Israel-#Azerbaijan defense cooperation. Some years ago, #Iran tried attack #Israeli officials in Baku.
