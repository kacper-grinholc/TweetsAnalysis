Israel Reaches Record Number of COVID Patients on Life-saving ECMO Machines. Currently 45 COVID patients are on the devices out of a total of 82. Since one-third are for backup in case of malfunctions, a shortfall is possible--Haaretz #COVID19 #Israel
@Senthan2002 @EzraHaba @ofercass #Antisemitism is condemning #Israel when you support the establishment of a #racist #Apartheid #judenrein #Palestinian state with a #Nuremberg law that prohibits #Jews from residing in it.
At least four #Palestinians were killed by #Israel-i gunfire near Jenin in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry says, amid reports of heavy clashes in the area.

@hairycheez @LioraSolomon85 @jeremyslevin @RashidaTlaib @IlhanMN @Ilhan Indeed. No supporter of Palestinians ever mentions those countries. Bet they can't even pinpoint them on a map or even #Israel for that matter.  #Hypocrites covering up their #ignorance, lack of knowledge and most of them, blatant #Jew hatred.
