@ShanzayJaved4 @al_ijaaz I wouldn't want to call you an idiot even if it were true. the point is different. israel does not need Gaza. israel does not occupy Gaza at all. #Israel  UN member state has never fired the first shot at Gaza.  if you are not an idiot you should understand that these are facts.
@NikkiHaley No connection. Stop peddling #Israeli foreign policy on #America #USA that will put our people at risk. #Israel only supports #America at the right price. Look at #Ukraine where #Israeli drones sold to #Moscow are killing #Ukrainians. #Truth #TelAviv #Kyiv
It seems like the militant group #Hamas does not rush a new battle with #Israel, but they are preparing for it everyday , almost every morning they fire test rockets towards the sea, and they watch closely all the developments in #Jerusalem

Tens of thousands of Palestinians cross the wall to work in #Israel illegally. Some portions of the fence can be defeated with a ladder and a rug. The level of manpower necessary to stop movement is far too costly to be practical. But politicians will lie to the public for gain.
First reports of a new #terrorattack in #israel 
The "separation fence" (a euphemism for what a noxious policy it really is) has always been more about de facto efforts to take land and dispossess Palestinians than about security. It's easy to bypass the wall. There's no way to make it effective from a security angle. #Israel
