Tens of thousands of Palestinians cross the wall to work in #Israel illegally. Some portions of the fence can be defeated with a ladder and a rug. The level of manpower necessary to stop movement is far too costly to be practical. But politicians will lie to the public for gain.
First reports of a new #terrorattack in #israel 
The "separation fence" (a euphemism for what a noxious policy it really is) has always been more about de facto efforts to take land and dispossess Palestinians than about security. It's easy to bypass the wall. There's no way to make it effective from a security angle. #Israel
