Some #Israel officials made condemnation statements, while a great effort is applied to supply humanitarian non-military aid, including a field hospital near #Lviv with the Israeli personal. On their own risk, many Israelis volunteer in different roles in and outside of #Ukraine.
3. #Israel hopes that neutrality may help to mediate at least a humanitarian ceasefire between #Russia and #Ukraine (in coordination with the #USA). The problem: while sieged and misplaced are in desperate need, the stable quiet may prevent Ukraine from liberating its territory.
2. In #Syria, Assad is not in control: #Russian military still dominates the sky, and #Iran-backed militants amass offensive capabilities on the border with #Israel. Occasionally, this buildup is attacked from the air. It's critical for Israel that #Russians keep not intervening.
1. There are #Jewish communities in both countries, and #Israel is very concerned about their wellbeing: making sure they are not accused and oppressed in #Russia, and hoping that #Russians would allow their evacuation from #Ukraine, if it comes to that.
#Estonia Prime Minister @KajaKallas gave an interview to the Israeli news site on the situation in #Ukraine.   (the audio and video are in English)  The circumstances of #Israel in this situation are complicated, as usual, causing its semi-neutral position.
This lady doesn‚Äôt understand the difference between a siege and a blockade.  Why would #Israel want to re-take #Gaza when it left it 17 years ago? But both Israel &amp; Egypt blockade it to prevent the entry of offensive weapons wanted by #Hamas for its jihad against Israel.

By making 2 states impossible #Israel is becoming one #apartheid state, but even apartheid cannot last for ever. Eventually it must become a state for all its citizens, in equality. Maps prove: The Judaization of East Jerusalem gathers steam 
The security concerns in #Israel are a constant threat to its population‚Äôs safety.  After the horrible massacre in Bucha, President Zelensky spoke to the media and said that #Ukraine will become ‚Äòbig Israel,' following its lead in making security a top priority.

@lonesail @yairlapid I understand your points, but #Israel never faced (yet...) a real invasion as this one #Russia does in #Ukraine - that's why I chose your country as an example to illustrate how nations should have total solidarity with eachother on true humanistic values (over mere interests).

Hamas-Linked Hackers Using Sexy Facebook 'Catfish' Lures, New Malware  APT-C-23, a Hamas-linked attack group, is said to be involved in a sophisticated catfishing campaign targeting high ranking Israeli officials.    #Hamas #Israel #Malware

#Israel has a historic mission, from our earliest ancient Kingdom untill today, to push the cause of Radical #Freedom in the world. 
Odd, politicians supporting #BDS against #Israel, opposing sanctions on principle against Russia. What could be so singularly different about Israel I wonder? Maybe it‚Äôs impolite to ask.

Remember the last time #Israel invaded a sovereign country without provocation, attempted to kill its president, and massacred unarmed men, women, and children without there being any attacks of Israelis, Jews or synagogues in the US &amp; Western Europe?    Yeah, me neither.
