Some #Israel officials made condemnation statements, while a great effort is applied to supply humanitarian non-military aid, including a field hospital near #Lviv with the Israeli personal. On their own risk, many Israelis volunteer in different roles in and outside of #Ukraine.
3. #Israel hopes that neutrality may help to mediate at least a humanitarian ceasefire between #Russia and #Ukraine (in coordination with the #USA). The problem: while sieged and misplaced are in desperate need, the stable quiet may prevent Ukraine from liberating its territory.
2. In #Syria, Assad is not in control: #Russian military still dominates the sky, and #Iran-backed militants amass offensive capabilities on the border with #Israel. Occasionally, this buildup is attacked from the air. It's critical for Israel that #Russians keep not intervening.
1. There are #Jewish communities in both countries, and #Israel is very concerned about their wellbeing: making sure they are not accused and oppressed in #Russia, and hoping that #Russians would allow their evacuation from #Ukraine, if it comes to that.
#Estonia Prime Minister @KajaKallas gave an interview to the Israeli news site on the situation in #Ukraine.   (the audio and video are in English)  The circumstances of #Israel in this situation are complicated, as usual, causing its semi-neutral position.
This lady doesn’t understand the difference between a siege and a blockade.  Why would #Israel want to re-take #Gaza when it left it 17 years ago? But both Israel &amp; Egypt blockade it to prevent the entry of offensive weapons wanted by #Hamas for its jihad against Israel.
