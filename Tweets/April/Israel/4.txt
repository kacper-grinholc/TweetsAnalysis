Anti Semitism is not really the problem.  The Zionist Lobby is happy to burn any MP who stands against Usraeli Apartheid &amp; Israeli Terrorism.  And the Labour Party is happy to take their money. #BDA #IsraeliTerror #Israel  #Arabs #Palestine #IsraeliApartheid #IsraeliCrimes #USA? 
My heartfelt appreciation to the men and women in all levels of #Israel‚Äôs #security forces who knowingly put themselves in harm‚Äôs way so that others may live in safety &amp; security. May they go from strength to strength in their efforts as they protect ALL the citizens of Israel. 
That‚Äôs so cute of you, @IsraelMFA . Will Isra√´l again actively support #Azerbaijan in destroying #Armenian existence, as in 2020 in #Karabakh, as part of ¬´¬†broadening the relations between #Israel and #Armenia¬†¬ª or no ? 
#Israel's Avigdor Liberman on Monday declined to condemn #Russia for war crimes in Bucha, Ukraine, a day after Foreign Minister @yairlapid spoke out against the massacre. 
Great idea! #Israel Suggests that Washington Ramp Up Sanctions on #Iran to Level Imposed on Russia

The #Negev summit is led by #Israel‚Äôs view &amp; fear, that the current momentum of the #ArabIsrael rapprochement is both, an opportunity for a historic do-over in the region, but also fragile enough that it can be lost away in regional turmoil: @KabirTaneja 
Recently, #Israel has seen a terror wave that's claimed the lives of 11 people, &amp; Israeli security forces have been working nonstop to prevent further attacks. Thank you to the heroes that dedicate their days &amp; nights to protecting everyone in Israel: Jews, Arabs, &amp; more.üáÆüá±üíô

.@KabirTaneja: ‚Äú#Israel perhaps sees itself as walking away with the most to lose if the current Arab-Israeli project dissolves in the near future, as it tries to, at the very least, build symbolic cooperation amidst sharp disputes.‚Äù 
@JeanValjean3132 @elshanaghalar @IsraelMFA @yairlapid @armenia @MFAofArmenia @AraratMirzoyan @ambassadorlion They have the exact same policy as Israel. They kill #Armenians on their ancestral lands, they are currently doing #EthnicCleansing in #Artsakh which is our #Palestine with weapons bought from #Israel

How can #Israel promote genocide against others? Are the Azeribuck$ so important that Israel gives up all semblance or decency? Maybe the next Israeli ally will be North Korea? #SanctionAzerbaijan

Proving, once again, anything the @cbc can do (subjecting its #Canadian tax-paying audiences to anti-#Israel, pro-#terrorist talking heads), the @BBC will say, ‚Äúwatch us &amp; learn‚Äù. On-air praise for murder in Israel. Again. Shame on #BBC.

Definitely yes. Main reason is because I've wanted to convert from Christianity to Judaism for a few years now. So after I become fully Jewish, I'd like to make Aliyah to complete my journey from Christianity to Judaism. #Judaism #JewishConversion #JewishSoul #Israel #Aliyah ‚ú°Ô∏èüáÆüá±
