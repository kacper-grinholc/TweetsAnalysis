Tomorrow night in NYC, joining an incredible group of Israeli Arabs and Amb @giladerdan1 to show the real #Israel 🇮🇱   Even when terrorism strikes and #antisemitism is skyrocketing, as Israelis we are united and we are proud to be Israelis! 
@YvetteCooperMP I’m thoroughly disgusted that a #slap on live TV has draconian consequences but Palestinian children living in an open air prison dying every other day over denied medical treatment by #Israel  is totally forgivable.   Idk if there’s even a word to describe the obscenity.

@IanHest This is exactly why I hope #Qatar makes their relations with #Israel official... Because there have been ties for years and the #AbrahamAccords are the perfect chance.
@dwnews and yet #israel says it’s position is NOT to hold russia accountable.
We need #Spike #NLOS to defeat the fascist invaders.   #Ukraine️ #SlavaUkraini #Israel 
Friends of yours @JustinTrudeau and partner @theJagmeetSingh referring to #israel not #Ukraine️?

@rafiq40973073 The Israel Palestine conflict, just like #covid and #GlobalWarming, cannot be solved inside the #capitalist system. Joint action by workers in #MiddleEast &amp; #Israel is needed to find just settlement by removal of all national borders. Free movement for all workers. @WSWS_Updates
Palestinian rioters clashed with Israeli security forces at Jerusalem's Old City's Damascus Gate on Sunday night.  #Palestinians | #Israel | #Ramadan

@DarthPutinKGB @yairlapid can you be more specific? Condemn who? Ukraine? Afraid to say Russia? Concerned about Putin’s feelings being hurt that a “reliable friend” is opening it’s eyes? #Israel #SlavaUkraini
