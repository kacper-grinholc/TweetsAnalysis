#Israel received $3,310 Million from America in 2020.  So, $3,310 MILLION my grandson tells me= $3.3 BILLION! (He has learned his decimal points!) So we fund #Israel, but #Israel is neutral on #Ukraine. Let us stop all aid until they reTHINK Neutrality. @KattyKay_  @Kasparov63

What is so complex about a state that denies a certain portion of its citizens rights, and treats them as inferior racial group?   These 2 minutes were hard to watch. Kudos to @yumna_patel .. idk how u handle this unimaginable cruelty, daily. #Israel #Apartheid

The foundation that #israel was built on consisted of nothing but massacres and atrocities against the Palestinians since 1948 . Todays is the 74th anniversary of the Deir yassin massacre .

“You know what doesn’t help our society? White Europeans at Amnesty, sitting in their comfortable London office, telling our sovereign nation of Arabs and Jews, how to run our country.”  Joseph Haddad (Israeli Arab), must see speech. #Israel #IsraelUnderAttack #StandWithIsrael

The massacre at #DeirYassin was widely publicized by the Jewish gangs and the numerous heaped corpses displayed to the media.. In Jaffa, speaker trucks drove through the streets warning the people to flee &amp; threatening another Deir Yassin Massacre and thus #Israel was created! 
@RayXerexes And yet #Israel was still a country under Persian rule. In fact, Persia allowed the Jews to return to Israel from exile.  Then Persia allowed the mohammadeans to take over and the rest is history.

1/2 A little side by side example of the kind of bald-faced lies #Israel deals with. On the left is what was told to the latest anti-Israel @UN "Commission of Inquiry," according to @WAFANewsEnglish. On the right is what Bennett actually said. 
A man opened fire at a cafe in the Israeli city of Rahat, four people were reportedly injured.  Rahat is a predominantly Bedouin city. The police officers who arrived at the scene were stoned by the locals.  #Israel
