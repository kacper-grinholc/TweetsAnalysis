#FreePalestine. Palestinians have every right to defend themselves form #israel occupation thatve been kidnapping &amp; beating Palestinian children the past 6 straight nights. Real Jews know the war crimes of the zionist occupation doesn’t nor will it ever represent Judaism.
Solidarity to #Israel for yet another horrible #terrorist attack in #TelAviv, with many innocents dead. Civilians must not be targeted, this is vile terrorism. #Israel has the right to defend her citizens from this evil, and from the #Hamas terrorists that welcomed the attack.
Have you seen them shedding tears when they kill innocent Palestinian kids.  #Israel 🇮🇱 #Palestine 🇵🇸
