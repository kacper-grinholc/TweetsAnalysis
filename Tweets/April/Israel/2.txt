@AnshelPfeffer @EliotHiggins And we keep wondering how a country like #Israel supports Russia. In my eyes, looking at Ukrainian Jewish History, it's the moral demise of Israel
@NewsOfMideast Mulitpronged. We need to make sure #china does not support war criminal Putin. PS where’s #israel.
The PA and #Hamas teach Jew hatred and instill a desire to commit violence against #Jews to their children &amp; their citizens.   The #PalestinianAuthority pay their citizens to  violently attack all citizens of #Israel There are no lone wolves. This terror is organized.

"Aside from the ongoing profiteering from water #theft, #Israel uses water as a form of #collective #punishment in the West Bank, while often denying Palestinians, especially in Area C, the right to dig new wells to circumvent Israel’s water monopoly"
After 73 years of clashes, it’s high time for the heads of #Christian churches in #Jerusalem and the rest of occupied  #Palestine to realize that their fundamental problem is not with radical, extremist, and fringe elements in #Israel, but with official #Israeli policy. 
@thebearj3w WRONG. #Israel is an occupying force and has taken over the state of #Palestine with the blessing of ONLY governments of a few Western nations. Their people are AGAINST this #Genocide. As am I.
@ArezouSaaberi @JZarif #Israel and U.S. together threatened the death of possibly 2-3 millions #Iranian civilians when they unleashed #STUXNET on #Iran. Read the NSA report of possible damage, being potentially as bad as #Chernobyl
The conflict between #Israel and #Palestine is fueled by the Hamas terrorist organization supported by Iran every #Ramadan.Threats to Middle East peace are terrorist groups supported by the #Iranian Regime.
