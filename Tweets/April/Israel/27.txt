#India is systematically ending the minorities and particularly #Muslims. A very thriving and diverse society is crushed. The comfort and ease with which it applies the same rules as #Israel applies on #Palestine is shocking. #IndianMuslimUnderAttack 
Amazing picture! ❤️  The first thing American journalist @Chusidel sees landing in #Israel is a #Muslim praying.   #ReligiousFreedom, respect, and tolerance are cornerstones of Israeli society.

@olalakl2 #IsraeliApartheid #Israel in #Ukraine. We see bone and skull here.  In history Russia help jews from nazi. But here we see something different. If israel real jews, they will help Russia.   We will see the ending of zionis
This evening is the start of the 2022 #holocaustremembranceday in #Israel: On this day we pause all our normal #routine, to commemorate the #memory of all our family members, friends and fellow jews, who were murdered by the Nazi regime in the #Holocaust. 
#Israel #Palestine: over 250,000 Muslim worshippers arrived at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in #Jerusalem on the holiest night in #Ramadan: Laylat Al-Qadr.  Pretty amazing and fascinating to see this much people in such a small place to worship God. 
I just signed the Together Against Apartheid Pledge. #Israel #Palestine Take action and let's come #TogetherAgainstApartheid.  
#Palestine is burning in #Ramadan and all Muslim Ummah is just watching..... When will the time come to stand united against the oppression of #Israel and #India   #PakistanPoliticalCrisis #ElonMusk #MarchAgaintImportedGovt #ReleaseBebargImdad

Disturbing: A poll by Darkenu has found that as #Israel marks Yom Hashoah, 56% of young Israelis don't know who the leader of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising was and 28% don't know what the Final Solution or Auschwitz was.
Today we usually say never again but right now I am saying no more! #HolocaustRemembranceDay #Israel #NeverAgain #NoMore #ElonMusk 
It would be nice if the supposed strong Catholic pope and Catholic president Biden started putting #israel🇮🇱 in their place like Russia. Until kingdom come #ourladyoffátima pray for us. 
"Past experience has shown, however, that economic pressure does not influence the behavior of Hamas and has not proven itself as a formula that can stop Hamas’s hostility and aggression, he cautioned."   #Israel #Palestinians #Abbas #Hamas

Because #Israel were the only ones who had conceived a different conduct, and for some of the time even carried it out, they were commanded to spread the information about their way to the rest of the world. #Jews
