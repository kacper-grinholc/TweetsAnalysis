#Russia &amp; # Putin have showed they are not a civilized nation and should NEVER be allowed in the global economy again. To target and want to lever Maripoul to the ground is evil, sickening. All countries should bomb the hell out of that Russian line. All of them not just the US

I don‚Äôt know why people even discuss the reasons #Russia invaded #Ukraine. It‚Äôs all lies. The world knows it. No need for a discussion. Violence, death, disgusting brutality. 45 million Ukrainians will hate Russians for generations. There is no need to understand it - just stop!
