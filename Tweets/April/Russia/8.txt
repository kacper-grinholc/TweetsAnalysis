#Russia has demanded the following:  - Don't expand NATO. - Ukraine agree to abide by the Minsk agreements.   America decided to intervene, after supporting a coup in #Ukraine, and start a proxy way with Russia.   This war could have been prevented, and ended already.
Good on #Belarus citizens. They aren't vandals, they are decent people trying to prevent further #WarCrimes against #Ukraine by ballistic missiles. Shame #Russia's people don't so the same. #FckPutin 
Nope my argument is that #Russia clearly isn't getting the results it expected from it's invasion of #Ukraine. 
#russia begs for aplause and an humanitarin award for killing children 👍🏽🙁
If #Russia were to be believed, then they aren't even fighting in #Ukraine.  Every time a missile strikes, the Russian government denies that it was fired by them.  #RussiaUkraineWar
#India says focus is on stabilising #economic ties with #Russia 
Boy I really rattled the hornets nest. So many #Russia'n trolls. 😂 
Secret police not so smart but that’s not surprising #Russia no to smart 
I love how these #democrat media sheeple keep ignoring me and they don't respond to me when I call them out for their lies and half truths. That speaks volume. @ReallyAmerican1 @JDCocchiarella @AaronParnas @RayReedMO @NikkiFried #politics #war #wars #republicans #russia #foxnews

The modern purpose of wars is no longer to win but to prolong them as long as possible. This allows military manufacturers &amp; contractors to keep extracting money from governments. The Russians could be trying to do the same now  #Ukraine #Russia #UkraineRussianWar #WarCrime #war
