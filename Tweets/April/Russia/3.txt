#Russia has requested a meeting of the #UN Security Council on Monday in connection with the "blatant provocation of Ukrainian radicals" in #Bucha, - Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN
“In the past, the Biden administration has taken pains to call the weapons it is providing to Ukraine defensive, and has focused on smaller, easily portable arms. But as the war has progressed, the definition of defensive has become more elastic.”   #Russia

Another shocking pro- #Russia parade in #Germany on Sunday. This time around 900 participants in #Berlin (who'd seen the photos from #Bucha but turned out regardless). 
#Russia #China #Ukraine #Propaganda China is allegedly ruled by dictatorship and lacks freedoms but our speech and press is censored like we live under a totalitarian country. Chinese are happier with their dictatorship than Americans are with its Oligarchy.
#Russia🇷🇺 is the 2nd largest crude oil producer in the world, behind the U.S.🇺🇸 and ahead of Saudi Arabia, but sometimes that order shifts. Russia earned over US$110 billion in 2021 from oil exports, twice as much as its earnings from natural gas exports.

#Russia’s penchant for brutality &amp; criminality continues — what a powerful, heartbreaking story from @BowenBBC, focused on just one victim of #Putin’s war on #Ukraine.  Watch here: 
@TuckerCarlson needs to emigrate to #Russia - he belongs to #Putin 
#ctdinl #ukraine #russia The #mayor of #Bucha, a liberated town 37 km (23 miles) northwest of the capital, said that 300 of its residents had been killed by the #Russian army. 
#Russia will wear the shame of this war for generations. 
#Russia denies Ukrainian allegations that it killed civilians in #Ukraine's town of Bucha, describing footage and photographs of dead bodies as a “provocation” and a “staged performance” by Kyiv. 
Just two days of a weekend Dozens of ships sailed from Russia with oil. Hundreds of millions of dollars for Russian budget and war effort. In just two days  #RussianOil #HelpUkraine #StopRussianInvasion #OSINT #Russia 
#RussianWarCrimes #Russia #UkraineRussiaWar #UkraineWar #Ukraine #Putin #Zelensky #Biden  Russian soldiers executed civilians in the town of Bucha in Ukraine, before they fled as Ukrainian forces retook the town.
#Russia just reset the #Ruble, it is now pegged to gold/commodities and by proxy, the USD.  The Ruble is now back to pre war levels.  China and India are buying all the Russian oil and commodities they can.  The BRICS have their own interbank settlement system.  Sanctions failed!

"Putin's Orders". Hopefully IC's have these orders intercepted, verified through his troops captured by #Ukraine 🇺🇦! Gather the evidence, and #Zelensky can press his case at the Hague. The #UN is proving it was founded in one instance by a criminal state, Make #Russia his prison!

They have full access to the information, benefitting from all the goods of #EU, not planning going back to #Russia and still prefer to support the #Genocide of #Ukrainian people and if it was possible, genocide of other #European nations as well, step by step #RussianWarCrimes

@Russia @KremlinRussia_E @GovernmentRF  #Orcs that’s what you are. You have shown yourselves to be so morally corrupt and inhumane, that how can the world view you as human? You have no humanity, no souls. Nothing. You are blackholes. @UN @NATO @potus treat #Russia accordingly.

Update: Canadian Prime Minister: Russia must be held accountable for the killing of civilians in Ukraine's Bucha.    #ukraine #ukrainewar #russia
Gold backed Russian #Ruble not only changed the current course of the war, will change future geopolitical map of world. Current sanctions to #Russia is backfiring to Western nations, especially to American #dollar.
"You mustn't kill people"  by "Solnzceva"  from #Russia.  #Ukraine #Mariupol #Bucha 
Although it's clear that Russia itself is becoming an ailing yesteryear power, the support from emerging Super Powers China &amp; India is hugely significant, especially India. For both it signals expansionist ambitions &amp; a closer alliance than perhaps the West gave credit.   #russia
NEW #UK's Ministry of Defence issues intel update re: #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine:  "#Mariupol is almost certainly a key objective of the Russian invasion as it will secure a land corridor from Russia to the occupied territory of #Crimea."  #Putin #Zelensky 
#Russia murdered the DOGS and PUPPIES in #Bucha! 
#Ukraine will try to highlight the option of international intervention in #Russia over the genocide/massacre narrative, similar to the campaigns made for #Syria at the time.
#Turkiye is significant regional power: Kremlin  Turkiye became most dominant state among #NATO members, says Dmitriy Peskov.  #Diplomacy #USA #Europe #Russia #Ukraine #RussiaUkraineWar #geopolitics #geostrategy  
The head of the Sumy VGA, Dmitry Zhivitsky, published a photo of the blown up bridge across the Seim River. It connected Sumy and Putivl.  #Ukraine #Russia 
YESSSSSS!  #Lithuania says it has cut itself off entirely of gas imports from #Russia, apparently becoming the first of the European Union’s  27 nations using #Russian gas to break its energy dependence upon Moscow.  via @HuffPost
Congresswoman @virginiafoxx:”There are needs to be more sanctions on #Russia.The sanctions are tough enough. We know they're working, and we need to tighten them up. And we need the Russian people to understand that their pain is being caused by the actions of Putin.” #THECAPITOL 
If the 🌏 refuses to stop #Putin now, what point is there in holding investigations?  We need to enforce consequences now and continuously until all perpetrators are held accountable.  Cleary #Russia wants to be hated by the 🌏, so this is no longer an effective consequence.
How did the war of #Ukraine and #Russia get overlooked over #slapgate between #ChrisRock and #WillSmith? We’ve GOT to do better.
