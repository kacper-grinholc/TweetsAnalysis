@DefensorFideiPL @KyivIndependent Lol. So #Poland refused to pay for the gas and vows to boycott all #Russian oil and gas imports but "#Russia is weaponizing energy exports"? Where did people like you grow up and go to school?🤦😂😂
The first video for using the French-German Milan anti-tanks missiles by the #Ukrainian_Forces  #France already has provided #Ukraine with dozens from this kind of weaponry #Russia #Russia_Ukraine #Ukraine 
I spent nearly every day of my military career staring down the USSR from close range. Those days may be in the distant past….but the contempt remains.  We need to stand up to #Russia right now. Russia must be neutered.  #UkraineRussiaWar
@GazetaRu Wow, so many goals.  So is #Russia funding Nazis this week or starting wars to find them in other countries? Sorry I lose track you guys flip so quick.
#Poltava (central #Ukraine) explosions. No details now. #Russia is a terrorist  @MIuliiaMendel

@blackintheempir People fighting in #Ukraine are not Nazis. Do you know any of them personally? Because I do! There are my family, my teachers, my students, my friends! And some of them have been killed by #Russia and their lies already. Give respect to your readers. Stop misinformation 
So, @RandPaul would be ok with #Putin invading Alaska because it was part of #Russia? Who voted for this #blitheringidiot?

@RandPaul encourages his #Russia daddy #PutinWarCriminal to attack #Alaska since it was once part of #USSR   #Republican logic 101 Sorry Alaska! Buckle up! 
After several days of back and forth #Russia captured #Zavodye. After the village to the N, Spivakivka was captured, 🇷🇺 forces were able to attack from 2 directions. A bridge S from Spivakivka over the Donets River was likely used to attack #Ukraine forces defending the village. 
Ukraine's President Zelenskiy: Since 1986, the year of #Chornobyl disaster, no other country in the world has posed such a large-scale threat to nuclear security as #Russia has with its aggression against #Ukraine. #StandWithUkraine
#Ukraine war: #Russia to halt gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria - BBC News 
@ivan_8848 Senator Paul should have pointed out to Blinken it was #Georgia who attacked #Russia in 2008 thinking #NATO would intervene and in Moldova #Russian troops are posted to a small autonomous ethnically Russian area Transnistria as Peacekeepers maintaining safe divide from Romanians
#russia needs #MakeInRussia #modernization plan. Its social dynamics where regional power struggles and fiefdoms can't curtail evolution of the nation. The directive needs to come from the top and  anyone violating the goals for development needs further 'council'.
#Siberia #Siberianwildfires #Russia #Russianwildfires  Rt Fires burn in Siberia, but Russian firefighting assets are in Ukraine 
#Russia has bombed the only road connection, a bridge, between Odesa and southwest #Ukraine. There is however a road within #Moldova that belongs to Ukraine. This was determined after Ukraine gave up a small territory to Moldova for their only port of Giurgiulești. #Transnistria 
#Russia's Su-34 RF-95858 How it started, how it's going: 
Putin, UN chief meet to discuss Ukraine  #AntonioGuterres #Moscow #Putin #Russia #Turkish Read Full  👇
5/ #Russia cut #gas supplies to #Poland. Poland national gas co. said the reserve stocks were almost full &amp; no immed disruption to customers  #RussiaUkraineWar #StopRussianAggression #RussiaInvadedUkraine #PrayForUkraine
4/ UK defence minister said #Ukraine could strike targets within #Russia with UK donated military eqpt. Later UK clarified it was not involved in the targeting process   #RussiaUkraineWar #StopRussianAggression #RussiaInvadedUkraine #PrayForUkraine
1/ Guterres met Putin in #Russia. Guterres said UN considered this an #invasion and said he stood ready to deploy resources to evacuate civilians in #Mariupol   #RussiaUkraineWar #StopRussianAggression #RussiaInvadedUkraine #PrayForUkraine
Just a reminder, we have no reason to fight a #WorldWar3 with #Russia over #Ukraine. It’s just to keep the establishment’s money laundering, human trafficking, and bio weapons scheme going.  
@Levi_godman And #ZelenskyWarCriminal said no peace treaty with #Russia while Russian troops are on #Ukrainian soil!🤦 I am still undecided whether this 🤡 really believes that #Ukraine can drive out Russia from #Donbass and #crimea or if he's just saying whatever his masters demand from him.
#British Prime Minister Johnson was asked whether #Russia's military failures in #Ukraine might lead Putin to use tactical nuclear weapons there, and he answered, "No, I don't think so."

@Nervana_1 I believe #Putin watched the film 300 and now has a new strategy that he will leave so many dead #Russia'n soldiers on the fields of #Ukraine that they will "blot out the sun" so nothing will grow... #Belarus #NATO
