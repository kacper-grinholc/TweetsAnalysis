Another thing to observe. The UN resolution calling for condemning #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine had only 4 or 5 countries voting against it. Now 24 countries voted against this resolution. (And 58 countries did not vote, 58+24=82 against 93, although 58 doesn't matter). 
Resolution to suspend #Russia from #UN HRC was not drafted in an open &amp; transparent manner. The hasty move has forced countries to take sides aggravating division among members &amp; intensifying conflicts between parties concerned: Chinese envoy to UN
