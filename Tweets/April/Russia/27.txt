There is something very twisted in the mind of #VladimirPutin, the #SupremeLeader of #Russia.  He expresses outrage  that countries are providing support for #Ukraine, when it is #Russia that has invaded a sovereign nation, creating the need for support from other countries.
RM: funny video. A naive fool with an American flag on his chest in the city of Kharkov is outraged that "majors in expensive cars" are returning to kyiv  #UkraineWar #RussianUkrainianWar #UkraineRussianWar #Russia #Ukraine #Kyiv #Azovstal #Azov #Russian #RussiaUkraineConflict 
You are a good leader Mr. President @ZelenskyyUa @Ukraine, come to our country sir, the struggle of your people against the occupation of #Russia is a right and an obligation that should be done. 🙏🇲🇨🇺🇦 #StandWithUkraine #StopPutin @VHamianin @ukrainamerdeka @jokowi @Menlu_RI  
@EmineDzheppar @lapatina_ The permanent members of the security council of the United Bations should Vote to expel Russia from having a seat #Russia is a pryer state - #marilynAlbright would approve

Very peculiar! Could #SudanCoup junta have made a deal with the #Ukrainians behind #Russia’s back? I agree that those flights weren’t for evacuation. The generals is in dire need for cash &amp; they’ll sell their mothers for it. That explains how they stayed afloat-ish so far. #Sudan 
US provided Ukraine with real-time info that allowed it to shoot down Russian troop transporter #Ukraine #Time #Russia

#Ukraine #Russia  The ongoing conflict has put us on a spot... * Prices of soy based products increasing * Prices of wheat based products increasing * Prices of sunflower oil reaching new high... * Steel &amp; construction industry would see an increase in demand.
The world is dealing with the #russia appeasement of 8 years ago  It is more difficult to deal with now  It will be impossible to deal with later  #ArmUkraineNow  #ukraine is fighting for the free world and they must win   #UkraineRussiaWar

🇷🇺🇺🇦⚡️Ukrainian Armed Forces wanted to attack "Tochka-U" in central Kherson, according to Izvestia correspondent Ivan Litomin. The rocket was shot down. Most likely, the target was the administration building, which is under the control of the RF Armed Forces.  #Ukraine  #Russia

I’m waiting until a few missiles head towards mother #Russia and hit some targets. Then we will have a party…

🇺🇸🇺🇦 The United States is ready to provide kyiv with the necessary means for self-defense, but the transfer of hostilities out of Ukraine is "another question", said Secretary of State Anthony Blinken  #UkraineWar #UkraineRussianWar #Russia #Ukraine #Ukrainian #Azovstal #Russian 
@FlipTheScr1pt Impossible scenario. But #russia doesn’t need to be invaded to choose nukes. #Ukraine has zero interest in Russia or Belarus. It would not be in Ukraine’s interest. When Russia is gone, Russia is safe.
Jeezus F Christ.  #Biden is counting on his war w #Russia to rescue his failed presidency.  What a vicious senile old putz.  @LockheedMartin rules. 
Management treated them like dogs. They were not even allowed to go to a store and were constantly held at gunpoint. They immediately warned that those who wanted to leave would be killed on the spot.  #Russia #Ukraine
How about all the leftists who think college should be free are the ones who should get taxed more to pay for people's "free" colleges? I like that idea. @briantylercohen @cnn @msnbc @elonmusk #politics #war #wars #russia #russian #russians #putin #resist #theresistance #maga
@Stephan06901389 @UnofficialZnet @GreenLeftOnline I asked questions &amp; included #Peace petitions.   Peace &amp; conflict studies show that lasting #Peace requires us to address the concerns of all parties in a conflict. You don't believe that #Russia's #peace terms are "worthwhile" to mention?  You prefer that the killing continues? 
Europe braces for #gas crisis as #Russia makes first move - CNN 
Isn't that called an oxymoron? #Russia #Ukraine #Putin #oxymoronau
