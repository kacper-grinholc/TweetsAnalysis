"the war against #Russia unfolded immediately after the annexation of Crimea and after the American special services organized a coup d’état in #Ukraine. It can be said that they tricked Russia into agreeing to the American occupation of Ukraine, considering it as temporary"
A “more kinetic response” to “atrocities” in #Ukraine? A #media question to @jrpsaki @WhiteHouse . Her response (for @JoeBiden ) essentially focuses on “interests of #USA &amp; its people”. #Russia #dictatorship #war 
Ukraine urged civilians to leave the eastern Donetsk, Luhansk and parts of the Kharkiv regions as it braced for a major new Russian offensive following Moscow’s withdrawal from the north of the country.    #War #Ukriane #UkraineRussianWar #Russia

President @sandumaiamd gave long presser on Monday. Sandu said #Moldova had joined some sanctions against #Russia after all; difficult to say how war will affect #Transnistria, but «5+2» negotiation format—w/Russia &amp; Ukraine—likely to be reconsidered.

Those worried about nuclear war, ask yourself this:  Do you REALLY want to live in a world where a deluded monster attacks others, takes what he wants, when he wants it, and threatens to destroy the planet if you don’t let him?  I sure as fuck don’t.  @mtaibbi @caitoz #russia

#Russia is expanding its global security operations, but these are typically to help defend independent states from the threats of #Washington and its proxies, e.g. in #Syria, #Venezuela and now also #Algeria. Saharawi sources:

EU is financing #Russia’s invasion of #Ukraine. EU is financing its own destruction. It is pointless to talk about NATO alliance when they are building a stronger Russia. Why NATO members are not asked to stop financing #Russia instead of asking US to finance NATO to defend them?
