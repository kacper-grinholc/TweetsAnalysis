Here's the daily thread for Day 41 of #Russia's full scale war, massacres, rapes + myriad other crimes and war crimes against #Ukraine  Ukraine, a nation which has never been at war in its short recent history until Russia's illegal invasions in 2014 and February 2022  Read on‚¨áÔ∏è
The same imperialist powers that are now crying ‚Äúshock‚Äù and ‚Äúhorror‚Äù at unproven allegations over killings by the Russian army have reduced large parts of the Middle East and North Africa to ruins. #Russia  #Ukraine #USA #PerpetualWar

Punishing war criminals is long drawn battle. It is to score political rhetoric. USA üá∫üá∏, #Russia üá∑üá∫, #Ukraine üá∫üá¶ are not parties to Rome Statute, so no jurisdiction @ International Criminal Court. @ruswarcrimes #StandWithUkrain #Ukraine   # via @HuffPostPol

@AmieMcWayne @NoLieWithBTC @nytimes Well, you can ask what ever question you @TuckerCarlson, but all of your questions are contextual to the main idea of, 'What if #Russia never invaded #Ukraine in the first place'? üëΩüëΩüëΩ
#RussianWarCrimes #Russia must not be allowed to win. Putin will get worse if they win.

@IvanKuhn8 @havesovharout @slav_zashov @nexta_tv Maybe they deny, but it‚Äôs proved with satellite images. People know that #armenia is always with #russia. They used to fight against #georgia in #osetiya, and against #Azerbaijan in 1st #Karabakh war. They did the same in #khojaly, as #putin did in #bucha.
@franakviacorka Belarusian military should open fire on the retreating Russian war criminals trying to cross the border into Belarus. If they surrender, detain for investigation into war crimes. #Putin #warcrimes #Russia #Ukraine #Belarus @lesiavasylenko @KyivIndependent @KyivPost @paulmasonnews
The irony. In attempting to make #Russia great and vast, #Putin, in his megalomania, has done the complete opposite and destroyed it on the world stage into the distant future. Wait until the Russians find out. If they‚Äôll love him then, they‚Äôll deserve every last bit of it. ‚úäüá∫üá¶

I really expected Tulsi's followers to Twitmo me today.  Then I remembered all her followers are from #Russia   ha!
I hear that some people who live in #Donbas want to be governed by #Russia. You know what's a good way to be governed by Russia? Live in frickin' Russia.
They pretend their own destroyed planes and tanks are Russian, they murder civilians and claim #Russia killed them, so why not this? (Yes, this is from an #Azov torture site in #Mariupol, and the Ukranazis who said it was "Putin propaganda" then know it.)
