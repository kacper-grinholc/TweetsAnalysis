#Leaders ✅#Russia is estimated to have lost up to 15,000 soldiers in #Ukraine since the war began roughly two months ago, but #Putin's #propaganda machine has obscured the true death toll and vied to keep it hidden from the public. 
Because they’re barbaric, they slaughter the innocent whom they accuse as NaZis, pregnant women, the disabled and the elderly, animals, even children who had no idea what/who the NaZis are. #Russia #Rissua #StopRussia #StopPutin #Ukraine️ #ArmUkraineNow #RussiaIsATerroristState 
Russian Strela-10 Air Defense System and command posts deployed on the Snake Island were destroyed by Ukrainian Armed UAVs  #UkraineWar #Ucrania #breaking #Russia #UkraineRussiaWar #Ukraine 
#Russia hit #Ukraine 1900 times in 64 days. 1900 missiles launched against Ukraine.  @lesiavasylenko
It is about #Russia ( attempting to restore the #multipolar ( global order that was lost.  WAR AND FAMINE ARE PARTNERS IN CRIME
This Russian/Ukraine situation isn't looking too good. Are people paying attention? #russia #Ukraine️ #WW3

@RussianEmbassy @mfa_russia @Wimbledon @tennisrussia @BelarusMFA @RusEmbassyMinsk @belarus_emb_UK @SkySportsTennis @bbctennis @RTUKnews @the_LTA We don’t care and believe in nixing Russians unless they are willing to publicly disavow #Putin and the #RussianWarCrimesInUkraine - bye bye #Russia
DIPLOMACY: #Energy #Economics #EuropeanUnion #Russia #USA The US is obliged to provide Energy to the EU if sanctions are retaliated by Russia  
It is important to realize that the US position (total absence of effort to find a diplomatic solution &amp; full support for #Ukraine️ to wage war against #Russia to harm her, knowing that it will leave Ukr wrecked) is just continuation of anti-Russian policy.  Only that matters.
Something going on over #Belgorod in #Russia tonight. Anti-air missiles fired and flashes in the sky  
Millions of people, both soldiers and civilians were killed. From Korea in 1950 to Afghanistan recently via Vietnam. #Russia #Ukraine #UkraineRussiaWar #Kyiv #Maruipol #Moscow 
THEY ARE TRULY EVIL, THE WHOLE WORLD IS AFRAID TO SAY SO  #russia #ukraine #NATO 
Listening to @HannahMacIn-nes on @TimesRadio talking 👏 about #Russian &amp; other interference in #Brexit Referendum. She was shouted down by Anne Mcelvoy editor at #TheEconomist ~ "You're wrong, you need to go &amp; look that up"  Links to #Russia &amp; #CambridgeAnalytica is well-covered 
We will be joined by Dr. Lee Artz, for tonight's episode of The Roundtable Perspective. This episode explores the media portrayal of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and our perception of the news we consume regarding the war. Tonight on @lakeshorepbs! #Ukraine #Russia #Media

Scott Ritter: Russia Already Won Ukraine War  via @YouTube #Ukraine️ #Russia  The US surely does not expect Ukraine to win. The aim of the US was and is, to drive a wedge between Russia and Europe in order to keep Europe dependent on America.

Ridiculous claim that 500,000 have been deported from #Ukraine to #Russia. Majority ran from war activities into Russia, many had friends and relatives living in Russia. For #Zelensky it's hard to explain foreign media why and how #Ukrainians would go to Russia to be as refugees 
Manuela Schwesig! Blindness is NOT a contractual obligation. #Russland #Schwesig #Ukraine #Gazprom #Massacre #Survivor #armukrainenow #saveukraine #Russia #Genocide #StandWithUkraine 
But even in the days of glorious triumphs, Russian armies sometimes found themselves in evil straits. One example is the Siege of #Sevastopol, which resulted in one of the most heroic acts of resistance in Russian history. #Ukraine️ #Russia
@StratcomCentre How strange the Russians now want what I assume they call ‘Nazi’ bloody!?  There is NO limit to Russian barbarism and crimes.  #Russia #Russian #RussianWarCrimes #UkraineRussiaWar

In the 19th century, #Russia was involved in many wars that were not always successful. The Crimean War (1853–1856) ended with the defeat of Russian troops and the loss of #Crimea to the British and French allies. #Ukraine️ #war #StandWithUkraine️

(If there is 1 country that truly deserves to be wiped off the map, it is not #Russia. It's #Switzerland.  RU got duped by a cunning tyrant.  Switzerland tho - since the start, it aids and abets, funds and finances war, theft, tyranny, and terrorism. Its entire wealth is stolen.)

Another day goes by and Russia continues to supply gas to the West. Why? Because it is desperate and dependent on Western money. It has no real trade partners that can sustain it. Russia will NEVER shut off gas West. They need our money BAD! #Russia
