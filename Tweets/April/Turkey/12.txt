I wish I could say the same for the UK... we could do with encouraging and investing in culture for all the good it does.  Ataturk had the right idea!   #heritageonholiday #ataturk #culture #ProjectManager #Turkey 
@RTErdogan desperate to cover up his ineptitude has unleashed sadists to torture dogs &amp; cats. They pretend they are acting under religious zealotry, that animals are "dirty". Dog rapists, cat torturers, THIS is who supports dictator #Erdogan. #Turkey has devolved into brutality.

What were you saying about "strong #AnimalRights" existing in #Turkey @TurkishEmbassy @TurkEmbLondon? You have sadists working for your brutal dictator @RTErdogan &amp; #Turkey exists in the Dark Ages. No religion calls for torture of #Animals. #Turkey isn't even a 3rd world nation.

#Turkey is in the midst of brutal sadism against animals. @RTErdogan imploded the economy &amp; to distract, unleashed #AnimalAbusers, dog rapists, all hiding behind religious zealotry.  Turkey is spiraling the drain &amp; everyone is too scared to call out the inept, tiny, egomaniac.
