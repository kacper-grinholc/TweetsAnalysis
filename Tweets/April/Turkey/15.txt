The balance of power still favors #Russia over #Turkey in the Black Sea for now, but that advantage has been chipped away at noticeably in the last 24 hours.
Recall in 2014, Russian admirals bragged about their supremacy over #Turkey after taking #Crimea. Two years later, #Erdogan called the Black Sea a "Russian lake".   That lake is now missing its biggest piranha, news that may be welcome in some corners of the TR military.
Strategically, it works for #Turkey too though no one will openly celebrate the ship's demise.   #Moskva was at best an important element of the A2AD-like system that provided for Russian supremacy over the Black Sea; losing her chips away at that-
Suddenly #Turkey closing the Black Sea may yet reap some dividends for #Ukraine after the #Moskva was destroyed yesterday.  With Montreux now invoked, #Russia has no means of replacing her and RU Navy is more vulnerable from the air.
