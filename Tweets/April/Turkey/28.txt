@NATO should consider helping your partner #Turkey as their inflation is at 70%, or just leave them be as that's how NATO works.  If you are unable to help then stop expanding, the alliance image is on the line for world to see, on what happens if joined NATO.
Worth following whether #Erdogan's rapprochement with #SaudiArabia will have an effect on #Turkey's policy towards #Libya.  Riyadh - alongside Cairo - had publicly welcomed Agila Saleh's endorsement of a new executive under Bashagha last month.  
@Strandjunker @elonmusk This applies a lot to #Turkey constantly harassing Greece with violating its airspace and not recognising its maritime jurisdiction in the #Aegean. #NATO keeps silent constantly helping the oppressor continue its violations.
41 overflights and 168 airspace violations in 1 day. #Greece faces a real and present threat from #Turkey. Turkey risks a confrontation with a well-armed and exceptionally trained NATO member-state that it cannot afford at the moment. #NoJetsForTurkey
