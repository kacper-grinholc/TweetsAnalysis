@yanni_karalis @GoGoGokkhan @hermes_z @Eleni_Co In 1920, #Turkey-#Armenia signed the Gyumri Agreement.  According to the agreement, "Armenians who did not participate in the massacres and migrated are allowed to return to Turkey".  With this agreement, the #Armenians accepted the #massacres they committed. 📌

#Turkey,philanthropist and #HumanRights defender #OsmanKavala sentenced   to life in prison with the accusation of financing the 2013Gezi Park protests. Really absurd,terrible,unjust.. no words except the ones I will continue to repeat: #FreeOsmanKavala!
#Breaking: Germany emphasised Turkish activist Osman Kavala must be "released immediately" after a court sentenced the critic of Turkey's President Erdogan to life in prison. #Germany #Turkey
#Turkey, surely!   #FreeOsmanKavala

@KremlinWumao Why should the #EU and #USA reap the economic benefits of #Turkey sanctions on #Russia, when the EU &amp; USA don't want Turks sharing the economic benefits of the EU as a Member?

#Turkey:  Turkish philanthropist Osman Kavala has been found guilty of attempting to overthrow the government by an Istanbul court. The rights activist was sentenced to life without possibility of parole. 
#Turkey has become a dark place, and you know what is more scary than the injustice against #OsmanKavala, Cigdem Mater, is #Erdogan is likely to win the next election!! 
@Meekeelee011 @ConnyMor @sparrowos32 @TheHirmen @aaronjmate You didn’t understand the question: I didn’t ask the name of countries purchasing your dirty oil or gas, I asked which countries support your war? Even #Turkey is opposed to this war &amp; doesn’t allow #Russian planes to pass over its territory any longer.
The Russian can now only use the airspace of Iran then the Iraqi, in order to get to #Khmeimim Air Base in #Syria, because of the decision from both #Turkey and #Bulgaria to prevent any Russian plane civilians/military from using the Turkish and the Bulgarian airspace 
The grave of the late founder of #SaudiArabia his Majesty King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Alsaud may god have mercy on his soul. Compared to the grave of Khomeini of #Iran 🇮🇷 &amp; the Ottoman sultan Suleiman of #Turkey🇹🇷. He fought heresies even in the smallest things.🤲🏽🕋🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦 
@SadhguruJV rode for 18 hours in stretch from #Bulgaria to #Turkey. My heart aches by learning this fact. There will be many unknown challenges he must be facing. Let’s do our part in the best way possible so he won’t need to do this. #savesoil #100DaysForSoil #JourneyForSoil 🙏🏽
