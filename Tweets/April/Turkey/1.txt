#TurkeyIsATerrorState, they are guilty of #Genocide. Whatever #Russia did to #Ukraine, Turkey has done worst in #Tigray &amp; #Oromia ! They need to be accountable for making #Tigray an experimental zone for their newest #Drones! #EU stop supporting #Genocider #Turkey! #KnowMore @EU

@MajinasGR @StefKarametos @ptolemy_soter @kurt_eye @fragoua @NikosDendias What is ratified is 1932.01 TR-ITA agreement, NOT the 1932.12 TR-ITA DRAFT agreement.  If the 1932.12 TR-ITA DRAFT agreement had been ratified, #Turkey could NOT have killed #Greece's armed men so relaxedly WITH FULL IMPUNITY, and Greece would go to int'l courts DEFINITELY!

@MajinasGR @StefKarametos @ptolemy_soter @kurt_eye @fragoua @NikosDendias 6) Hence, #Turkey HAS the right to kill as many  #Greece's armed terrorists as TR wishes that will try to invade Turkey's islands in the Aegean like the #Kardak one with FULL IMPUNITY!  Of course, after killing, #Turkey MUST not torture the corpses of #Greece's terrorists! 
Is #Saudi buying its way out of justice for #Khashoggi murder?  #Turkey, economically squeezed and looking to mend ties, suddenly turns the case over to Riyadh. 
She is desperately struggling with the progress of humanity and civilization: with the US and EU decisions on reducing oil and gas dependences... And still she is "defending democracies" at the @FDD with immense love of dictatorships in #Azerbaijan and #Turkey. She's a proffesor. 
#Turkey still wants the mediator role, and it also discusses hosting Presidents #Putin and #Zelensky in #Ankara, though it does acknowledge that it is still too early for that.

Turkey NEVER responded to the Italian demarche, and it took NO such action!
@MajinasGR @StefKarametos @ptolemy_soter @kurt_eye @fragoua @NikosDendias 2b) ...NO such Treaty or International Engagement shall be BINDING UNTIL SO REGISTERED".  So, 28.12.1932 #Turkey-#Italy DRAFT note is NOT a legally binding document in this respect.
