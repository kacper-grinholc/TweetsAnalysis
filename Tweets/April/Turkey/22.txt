In #Iraq, strengthening the state, enhancing the country's sovereignty, and preventing #Sinjar from becoming a bigger battleground is important. Resolving the #PKK issue politically in #Turkey will be a better and more sustainable outcome.
The trend of war/military operations (instead of non-violent means) to resolve problems that are political in essence  is worrisome: #Turkey in #Iraq &amp; Syria, Iran in Iraq &amp; #Syria, #Saudi &amp; #UAE in #Yemen, #Russia in #Ukraine, etc.
#Turkey has been trying to resolve the #PKK issue militarily for decades and expanded its operations beyond its borders, but without a resolution. Dialogue in recent past progressed with positive results, but stopped due internal and regional factors.
