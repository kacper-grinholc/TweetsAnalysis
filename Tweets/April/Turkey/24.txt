In official statements, how correct is it to point only the Ottoman Empire as the perpetrator of the #ArmenianGenocide?  Even in 1918, mass massacres of surviving Armenians continued in the eastern provinces. At that time, there was #Kemalist #Turkey, not the Ottoman Empire.

#Genocide continues to be a tool for Turkic nation-state building in #Turkey, #Azerbaijan at expense of #indigenous.  These #settler states lack democratic foundations; therefore recognition/compensation/end of genocide seems  unlikely  Instead, genocide is still at full throttle
#Turkey refusing to acknowledge their role in the #ArmenianGenocide, is the same as #Japan refusing to take responsibility for their war crimes in #WWIII!

Recognition of the #ArmenianGenocide is foundational for meaningful reconciliation process not only between #Armenia and #Turkey but also within the #NagornoKarabakh conflict context as well
#Turkey refrained from activities that could cause tensions with #Greece &amp; #Cyprus (…) NAVTEX was not promulgated in the sea area between the 26th &amp; 28th meridians, which Turkey claims as part of its EEZ, to avoid causing tensions with Greece and #Egypt.
#Turkey is Guilty of #Genocide  #ArmenianGenocide #ChristianGenocide

April 24th is #ArmenianGenocide Remembrance Day. Today marks the 107th anniversary of 1.5 million Armenians murdered by the Ottoman Empire. #Turkey is still denying it and shamelessly repeating it. We will never forget &amp; we will persevere 🇦🇲❤️

@elonmusk @BillGates birthday at #Turkey the birthday boy got the present of some severe backlash for patrolling as a climate warrior and then partying on superyachts which release 7,020 tons of carbon dioxide per year. Jeff Bezos wasn’t spared either.
