In official statements, how correct is it to point only the Ottoman Empire as the perpetrator of the #ArmenianGenocide?  Even in 1918, mass massacres of surviving Armenians continued in the eastern provinces. At that time, there was #Kemalist #Turkey, not the Ottoman Empire.

#Genocide continues to be a tool for Turkic nation-state building in #Turkey, #Azerbaijan at expense of #indigenous.  These #settler states lack democratic foundations; therefore recognition/compensation/end of genocide seems  unlikely  Instead, genocide is still at full throttle
#Turkey refusing to acknowledge their role in the #ArmenianGenocide, is the same as #Japan refusing to take responsibility for their war crimes in #WWIII!

#ArmenianGenocide done by #Turkey with support of #Nazi #Germany and after #ColdWar denied and supported by #USA by founding #NATO. HOW CAN WE EXPECT #USA üá∫üá∏  "THE MOTHER OF GENOCIDES OF THE WORLD" RECOGNIZE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE??!!

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he has discussed with #Turkey‚Äôs Recep Tayyip Erdogan the need for the immediate evacuation of civilians from the mostly Russian-occupied port city of #Mariupol. 
@Raupe3 The Idea of Europe was based on UK - France - Germany Achse.  France "last man standing" on the continent with Macron will have to convince the UK, not Germany for the future.   Argument will be new perspectives like #ukraine or #turkey not old problems like #austria or #Germany
@channelstv I need a Yoruba person in #Istanbul #Turkey for a small gig. Kindly recommend anyone.
@g_mastropavlos Exactly, but @ZelenskyyUa unfortunately has a different opinion. He trusts #Turkey terror state for some reason. He even considers turkey as one of the saviours of  #Ukraine.  At least that's the vibes I get through his tweets.
Recognition of the #ArmenianGenocide is foundational for meaningful reconciliation process not only between #Armenia and #Turkey but also within the #NagornoKarabakh conflict context as well
#Turkey refrained from activities that could cause tensions with #Greece &amp; #Cyprus (‚Ä¶) NAVTEX was not promulgated in the sea area between the 26th &amp; 28th meridians, which Turkey claims as part of its EEZ, to avoid causing tensions with Greece and #Egypt.
