An Istanbul court has sentenced Turkish-Dutch rapper Murda to four years and two months in prison for "inciting people to use drugs” in his songs. #Turkey 
And the odds of the perpetrators of the crime having to pay any kind of price is what? Let’s be honest. We know who #Turkey is and we know how they operate. There is a reason they went back to their roots of #Turkiye cause in 100 years not much has changed. #BoycottTurkey 
/  Phosphorus burns caused by prohibited chemical weapons containing chemical elements, particularly  “white Phosphorus”,  used against innocent civilians by #azerbaijan during 44 day #Artsakh war  “WAR CRIME”  These chemical weapons came from #Turkey, #Israel or #Ukraine  / 
received from Boris Johnson in London. It seems that the #KRG version of "Kurdishness" or "Kurdistan" is preferred in the West and by #Turkey as well. They do business with the West and oppose the PKK and its offsprings - which are designated as terrorist organizations. &gt;&gt;
This could have implications for the #Turkey's presence in #Syria (against the #YPG) and security/stability at home.  2. I already touched upon the ideological aspect of TR's interventions/presence in #Iraq. There are multiple statements from #Erdogan and #AKP officials &gt;&gt;
#PKK (or the #YGP in #Syria, for that matter) and has developed very close economic and political relations with #Turkey. So, against this brief background, what are the drivers of TR's intervention in northern #Iraq (including the most recent operation #clawlock)?  &gt;&gt; 
In this context, #Turkey seeks influence through perceived/real kin communities in that area, particularly the Sunnis and #Turkmens. In the last 10-15 years these communities include the #Kurds that identify with the #KDP of the Barzanis. This party does not support the &gt;&gt;
should belong to #Turkey, because it was included in the Misak-ı Millî (the 1920 National Pact of the nationalist movement) that "defined" the territorial objectives of Kemal's war. The Mosul objective remained open with the #Lausanne Treaty &amp; was settled separately in 1926. &gt;&gt; 
I won't cover it here. The story of how #Turkey-#KRG (Kurdish Regional Government, #Iraq) improved in the late 2000s is also interesting and relevant, but maybe for another time.  What's probably important to note is that #Turkey under the #AKP (since 2002), has a more complex &gt;&gt;
#Iraq was not less of a security concern for #Turkey. The 2003 American+ invasion of the country and the 2005 constitution that gave substance to Iraqi #Kurdistan as a federated/state were highly problematic for Ankara. The related 2003 US-Turkey crisis was important but &gt;&gt;
🧵#Turkey invaded northern #Iraq - again.  Turkish operations in northern Iraq are not a new phenomenon, they've been happening for decades.  In 1984 Turkey and Iraq signed a Border Security Cooperation Agreement that allowed them to enter each other’s territory for up to 5 km &gt;&gt;

#Turkey invades #Iraq. No noise, no sanctions, NOTHING. You know why? Because Iraqis are not blond enough and they are #uncivilized. Hypocrisy level “God” aka “international community”.
The airport in Istanbul just still amazes me. It’s just massive! #travel #İstanbul #Turkey
[1/2] #Turkey: The Directorate of Prisons denigrated publicly the #Germany based @dw_turkce in Turkish, after the release of an article on torture allegations in prisons. In stead of replying DW questions before this release, it argued DW creates “negative perception”. 
18th century logic. What would #Turkey gain by taking the Balkans? They don’t have gas, oil or natural resources. Their inhabitants will guerrilla fight against Turkish troops for decades. If you put all these on a weight scale you realize you lose much more than what you gain
