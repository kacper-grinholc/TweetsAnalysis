Ferhan Yilmaz died in Silivri Prison of #Turkey, reason for his death told to be heart stroke. Yet this footage revealed that he was subject to torture in jail. Recently, allegations about killings or instigating inmates to commit suicide have been prevalent about Turkey’s jails.

Why are #UAE &amp; #Turkey allowed to kill millions using drones made of western technology? Ppl in #Tigray &amp; #Oromiya are being bombed daily by drones supplied by Turkey &amp; UAE. @SecBlinken @WHNSC @Jakejsullivan @USAinUAE @USEmbassyTurkey #StopDroneAttacks
When will the international community hold #Turkey &amp; #UAE responsible for the mass killings around the world by supplying drones? @POTUS @SecBlinken @LindaT_G @jakejsullivan @HouseForeign @SenateForeign @StateDept #StopDroneAttacks
#Turkey &amp; #UAE supplied drones are used to commit crimes against humanity in #Tigray. As the world watches silently, millions are being killed by man-made famine  drones from the air! @UN @FilippoGrandi @UNHumanRights @UN_HRC @hrw  #StopDroneAttacks
