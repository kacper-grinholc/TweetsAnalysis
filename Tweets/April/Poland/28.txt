#Poland buying #Russian gas through reverse pipeline from #Germany. So Germany is in a tough place, by buying more gas from Russia is the only way for them to sustain their economy.
#Poland and #Bulgaria have reached the payment deadline and refuse to pay using the new system, that implies creating a bank account in #Russia, purchasing Rubles and then transferring the funds in Rubles to Gazprom. These countries do not get any gas now.   #RussiaUkraineWar

#Poland is still buying #Russian gas in #Germany, and that reverse supplies to Poland via the Yamal pipeline amount to around 30 million cubic meters per day. The price is 30% higher than in the case the gas was purchased directly from #Russia.

Poland's dirty game. "After the suspension of direct supplies, Poland bought Russian gas. But now it comes from Germany, from where it flows back to Poland via the Yamal-Europe pipeline in the opposite direction. #svpol #Eupol #Poland #Gasprom
DPR troops in #Mariupol seized the #OSCE archive thus revealing irrefutable EVIDENCE of how this organization covered up the crimes of Kiev regime by omitting them in its official reports as early as 2014. This made people very angry #Donbass #France #Germany #Poland #Bulgaria

#Top11: #Ochman – River (#Poland) Probably the best male voice of this @Eurovision comes from Poland. The song is good, but Krystian Ochman's performance makes it even better. And the video clip reminds me of René Magritte; a plus for me. Nearly top10.
Also, he thanks ambassadors of #Ukraine to #poland and Washington DC but not @MelnykAndrij in Berlin … 
So I heard a rumour #Poland wants to have a go at a part of #Ukraine too??

Aliaxis #Poland really shows what gender diversity can achieve! I had the pleasure of visiting a plant where women play a huge role at every level, including management, and the results showed in terms of safety and #sustainability. It will soon run on 100% renewable electricity! 
Is this some sort of "who is the most stupid" competition? #Gazprom says #Poland is still buying #Russian gas in Germany 
...and now a report (delivered with a straight face) on  #Россия24 on this ridiculous invention of the #SVR - that #Poland's going to invade #Ukraine 'to establish tight military-political control of Poland over “their historical possessions” in Ukraine'. 
In face of the #humanitariancrisis in #Ukraine #Poland is experiencing a huge housing challenge. Mobilisation of Poles, local governments and NGOs is unprecedented. What else is beneficial for cities today? On @Miasto_Lublin and @warszawa best practices in crisis. Friday 2PM 1/2

Checkout #European hypocricy. #Poland refused to buy #Russian gas for Rubles, but Poland is buying the same Russian gas from a #German company. By the way as soon as Poland and Bulgaria were refused the supply of gas, all the European countries found courage to pay in Rubles.
Table with a view! Old town, Warsaw and #wuzetka, traditional #Warsaw dessert. Its name is probably derived from the Warsaw W-Z Route, on which the confectionery that first began to sell the dessert in late 1940s was located. #poland @CentralEasternE
