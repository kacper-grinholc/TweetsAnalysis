#Poland’s double standards: I’m at the #Belarus border forests for @humanrights1st, where Polish authorities are attacking refugees from the Middle East &amp; Africa &amp; those defending them. So different from Poland’s great welcome of refugees at the #Ukraine border @GrupaGranica 
#Poland Is Doing A Great Job On Providing Humanitarian Aids And Hospitality For Ukrainian War Victims. STAY STRONG #Ukraine    Slava 🇺🇦

❗️Yesterday 23,000 people entered #Ukraine from the territory of #Poland.  This is the highest number since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.  #StopRussianAgression #StopWarInUkraine 
A humanitarian crisis has been playing out at #Poland’s border with #Belarus, exposing the #EU's two-faced refugee policy. Here, refugees are not met with cups of hot tea and free transport, but with volleys of tear gas, barbed wire and #pushbacks.

President @ZelenskyyUa honors memory of Smolensk air disaster victims and expressed solidarity with Polish partners, who are standing with Ukraine against the Russian aggression. #smolenskpamietamy #stoprussia #StopRussianAggression  #Ukraine #Poland
@SamRamani2 (N.B. In the 14th century, The Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the largest country in Europe; present-day #Lithuania, #Belarus, #Ukraine, and parts of #Poland and #Russia were all lands of The Grand Duchy.)
@JoyAnnReid Yes, it is. But what I find much more frightening is the attitude of supposed democrats who remain silent or even try to silence those who are not. #Poland and #Hungary have #fascist dictatorships what is largely ignored because they are useful in the fight against #Putin .
💢Thank you, people of #Poland, for your support! Krakiv, April 9, 2022.

Powerful “March of Mothers” in Kraków right now against Russia’s war. Over 1,000 Ukrainian and Polish women united: “Bucha, Irpin, Mariupol! Putin, stop killing our babies!” Speaker holding doll covered in blood.  #marchofmothers #poland #marszmatek

@KateNWF Any update on the 150 shelter dogs that were turned away at the Poland boarder? It just breaks my heart thinking about them. Is there anyway to help them get to a safe place? #StandUpForUkraine  #donate #Poland #SupportUkraine #dogsofukraine #DogsofTwittter #Refugees
