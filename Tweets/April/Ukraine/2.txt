🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦😪 #StandWithUkraine #WarCrimes #StopPutinNOW #RussianArmedForces #Ukraine #StopWarInUkraine #OpRussia #Anonymous  I'm sobbing my heart out having seen the tweet below.  The world needs to see this. Please Retweet &amp; share everywhere you can.  😪😪😪 
#Ukraine can bring war to an end in 5 minutes, including withdrawal of #Russian troops, by agreeing: (i) no entry of Ukraine into #NATO, (ii) respect of rights of Russian speaking population in East Ukraine. It refuses. Anyone wanting peace should demand Ukraine carries these out
There are millions of people like me in #Ukraine: without a past, without a home land, without traditions. All this was destroyed by the russian empire, by the soviet regime. #russians tried to destroy Ukraine for centuries, but they didn't succeed, in spite of everything.
@POTUS we never ask #Americans to sacrifice; could #Americans carpool 1day/ wk, instead of driving 80mi/hr do 70! show Putin his oil means nothing to us! show support for #Ukraine
