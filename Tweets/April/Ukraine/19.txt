#TheReidOut #inners #maddoe #thelastword# #Ukraine #MalcolmNance #MSNBC  We saw the interview w/⁦@JoyAnnReid⁩ yesterday &amp; #CNN is covering him today!!   ‘I am done talking': Former MSNBC analyst now fighting in Ukraine
@AdamKinzinger @MalcolmNance @TuckerCarlson @GOPLeader @Liz_Cheney #Putin STOP KILLING! You have the power, weapons, infrastructure &amp; manpower! You are supporting the brutal deaths &amp; brutal rapes of thousands of men, women &amp; children! WHY? What have these #Ukraine people ever done to you?   @KremlinRussia_E @ZelenskyyUa @JustinTrudeau #cdnpoli 
EU countries must stop using lack of consensus on oil and gas embargo as excuse and simply impose those measures unilaterally. You can‘t blame it all on Orban and then just do nothing in the meantime. #Ukraine deserves better.
@TheStudyofWar Things are not looking good for #Ukraine, Mr ISW.
#Ukraine #Ukraine #WeaponsforUkraine Holland 🇳🇱  will send heavy weapons, including armor, to 🇺🇦. 🇳🇱 decided in February to send 200 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to 🇺🇦, 2 battlefield surveillance radars and 5 artillery detection radars, and 100 sniper rifles. 
New surrender deadline in #Mariupol as West promises #Ukraine more arms #RussiaYouWillNotPrevail  
#Ukraine's BMP-1 in action. 
@MFA_Ukraine @We_are_Ukraine_ Thank you to all the Doctors around the World 🌍 who are volunteering to help the wounded in Ukraine. You're the angels that will help Ukrainians heal both physically and emotionally. #Ukraine #Doctors #Healers 🇺🇦 🏥 😇 🙏❤️
Pictures from a home that was set ablaze by Russians shelling in the town of Orekhove in the Zaporizhya region  #Ukraine #Russia 
In #Ukraine and the world over, people are losing everything they have because of violent conflict. Urge Home Secretary Priti Patel to take compassionate action for the world’s refugees, and rethink the harmful Nationality and Borders Bill 
Hey @ChampionPetfood - has your acquisition by @nestle closed??   My 🐶🐶🐶 love @ORIJENPetfood but considering, @Nestle’s continued support of #RussianAggression in #ukraine, I do not want to be their customer. Thanks!

I got this picture taken at #Hamburg #Hauptbahnhof, central station, in #Germany on April 19, 2022. The people are nice &amp; try to help #refugees from #Ukraine. But that sign leads to just an open &amp; dirty space... @DB_Bahn @Senat_Hamburg #Гамбург #Німеччина #Fluechtlinge @DB_Presse 
#Ukraine 70-year-old Nadiya Trubchninova hitchhiked daily to Bucha seeking her son's body. It took her more than a week to find him.   The people's tragedy is incomprehensible 
War....the biggest profiteer of all!  But but #Ukraine  Yeah, keep feeding the narrative. 
@alanfryermedia it's tough for Trudeau liberals pretending to be a friend to #Ukraine when the team they desperately want to play on is China/Russia. @JustinTrudeau @cafreeland @melaniejoly @AnitaAnandMP  #cdnpoli
Morgues in #Ukraine struggle to cope with the number of victims of war.  #RussiaWarCrimes #allrussiansareresponsible  
@TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @kylieatwood @KatieBoLillis @cnnbrk @CNNPolitics The biggest difference with the war in #Ukraine versus the war in Syria is the coverage. Cellphones and social media, enable us to SEE the violence in REAL TIME. Bombings almost as they happen on the ground. Syria was NOT SHOWN like this. @Ukraine WILL NOT ALLOW us to look away.
@jana_puglierin in @ForeignAffairs: "The eastward expansion of #NATO (and the #EU) has stabilized and democratized central and eastern Europe...." #Russia #Ukraine 
In the South, the Armed Forces of Ukraine destroyed 19 Russians, armored vehicles and an Orlan drone in a day --- #war #ukraine 
We cannot allow Obama’s 2.0 White House lead us to WWIII in #Ukraine. @SecBlinken, @JakeSullivan46, @UnderSecStateP, Susan Rice. NO MORE WEAPONS. NEGOTIATE FOR PEACE
@dwnews  Except for #Germany. #OlafScholz prefers to indirectly help #Putin, buying #Russia's oil &amp; gas to fund #PutinsArmy. Blocking contracts for heavy weapons to #Ukraine allowing for more #RussianWarCrimes. He probably loves this video of #Kremlin #NeoNazis too
#Ukraine: Russian IFV (Infantry Fighting Vehicle) burning in Luhansk region.

People of Mariupol have to live.  They have to get out.  #savemariupol #armukrainenow #mariupol #stoprussianaggression #stoprussia #russianwarinukraine #russianwaragainstukraine #ukraine #україна #маріуполь #helpukraine 
#ToryHypocrisy over #Refugees from #Ukraine 
@blackintheempir And that they want young people to enlist &amp; go on a #Civilian #killing spree in #Ukraine, go back to their countries with #PTSD (as heroes lol) and kill themselves off as a certain people profit! #Resistthelies &amp; fight for your national interest first.
