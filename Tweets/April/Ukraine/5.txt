In the face of the horrific atrocities in #Ukraine, it is now abundantly clear that there is no place for Russia on the @UN Human Rights Council. The UN credibility is at stake. So let us vote with our conscience and suspend #Russia from the @UN_HRC. The whole world is watching. 
#Ukraine is 'still' be disgracefully cheated and betrayed!  During in the #IraqWar we were spending '$9 billion' a "month!"  "Every" General of note, speaks of the West being far too passive @JoeBiden @VP @SecDef @NATO @ArmyChiefStaff @jensstoltenberg? 
Biden calls Putin a "war criminal" for the invasion of #Ukraine and intentionally targeting civilians.  03
Food is a human right, everyone deserves enough to eat,  and targeting food infrastructure or blocking food aid is a warcrime.  #Yemen #Tigray #Ukraine 
Is there a reason @Steam is still live in Russia?  What kind of scumbag company are you? #boycottsteam #Ukraine #UkraineRussiaWar #Genocide #GenocideOfUkrainians
@vonderleyen Sanction the Russians completely, except for humanitarian items. Deliver the required weapons and defense equipment, which Ukraine has repeatedly made clear. #Ukraine #StandWithUkraine #StopRussia #Bucha

Has anyone found Putin's bunker yet? Asking for the entire world.  #PutinIsaWarCriminal #Ukraine
Please, #Ukraine. If you keep this up, my table is going to flip over from my hard sausage. It cannot get any harder. 
🇨🇿 The Parliament of the #Czech Republic recognized the killings in Bucha and other cities of Ukraine as a war crime and voted to convene an international tribunal.       #StopPutin      #Ukraine #EU #European #US #CINA #INDIA
Innocent Ukrainian people are being genocide as part of a Russian military plan. Evidence of the genocide will come to light one after another. Russia has become a mere terrorist state. The nations that support terrorist nations will also become terrorist nations. #Ukraine
Russia state news demands ‘liquidation’ of Ukrainians as evidence mounts of war crimes against civilians #SmartNews #Ukraine

RUSSIAN TANKS AND #UKRAINE RESISTANCE  01
@SlavenVeteran @mfa_russia @RussiaUN @Dpol_un @RusEmbUSA @RussianEmbassy @RussianEmbassyC @mission_russian @RF_OSCE @EmbassyofRussia @RusEmbIndia @Amb_Ulyanov The solution in that video has nothing to do with outside powers intervening. #Ukraine's goals of not losing any land to the invasion, being unified and militarily in control and #Russia's objectives with the #Donbas and #NATO can both be achieved with the same solution
Romania and Bulgaria have yet to send weapons to #Ukraine, although Cold War Era-material is certainly available in both countries. The latter is adjusting to seeing Russia as a threat, the former is careful because it directly borders the war.
Expert opinion on what #ukraine needs to force #Putin to retreat, and hold honest peace talks.  Ask your politicians why this is not being provided, and why it is not happening now.
You can't urge #russia to stop using land mines in #Ukraine without doing the same for #USA use of landmines in #Korea
Compelling, forensic rebuttal of Russian lies about the massacre in #Bucha by @malachybrowne on @cnn just now. Powerful. @nytimes #Ukraine
Pls forgive me .This illustration might be sensitive to some. I wanted to express in #Perspective. How Russia is enjoying the "Armor of Fear" to conquer the West. This led to genocide of innocent civilians in #Ukraine  #NATO 
WATCH LIVE: Here's the stories that you DON'T HEAR in the corporate/mainstream media  #Ukraine, #Russia #BuchaMassacre
“What is more opposite to music? …The silence of ruined cities and killed people.”- V. Zelensky. What is more opposite to dance? … The innocent dead and dying. #dancequotes #tututuesday #peace #ukraine 
⚡️⚡️ 📢 NOW: Russian troops are preparing to surrender #Kherson –Arestovich  #Ukraine 
Satellite images and videos are showing real time atrocities being committed in #Ukraine   I don't think it'll be easy for #Putin to cover this like he's done in the past, in Chechnya and other places...
@richardquest Well said sir! Genocide is far more important than recession. Ukraine must come first. #ProfitableMoment #Ukraine
Is this true? Looks like #WaPo nugs are saying  this informant believes #Ukraine  has a Nazi problem, they'd like to see em killed off..not at the cost of Kyiv infrastructure though. Embarrassed for US leadership, years of fubar foreign policy coming to haunt. 80 years, honestly. 
#Ukraine is home to a sizable #Greek minority, &amp; this is one of the reasons why #Greece has adopted a forward-leaning diplomatic presence in Ukraine. @Kitro1908 joins @ThanosDavelis to discuss the historic Greek presence in cities like Odessa &amp; Mariupol:
