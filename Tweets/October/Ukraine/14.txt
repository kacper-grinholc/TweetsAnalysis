🇺🇦Today Ukrainians celebrate the Defender of Ukraine Day – the country pays tribute to all those who have fought and continue to fight for the sovereignty of #Ukraine. We would like to acknowledge the diversity of the Armed Forces of Ukraine by sharing this infographic: 
#Ukraine commemorating 4 holidays in 1. One current as the Day of Defenders amid Europe’s only ongoing #war taking place in the easternmost part of the country. 1 religious held dear to Kozak heritage. And 2 historical as well 
#Ukraine daily confirmed #COVID19 cases approaching 20,000. Containment is a huge question as less than 20% of population is vaccinated.  
Today #Ukraine celebrates Defenders and Defendresses Day. We express our profound gratitude and honour the courage of all Ukrainian men and women who are protecting our freedom and independence. Thank you! 💙💛 #ЗавдякиТобі
