@matthi_williams @ChristopherJM As much as the Western world "love" to beat up #Russia on various topics, Russia has done nothing wrong. #Hungary signed 15 years gas deal with Russia without #Ukraine being involved. It's a free market. Ukraine will lose big $$$, but this is capitalism. #Zelensky must know that
@ChristopherJM #Saakashvili knew he was a wanted man in his native #Georgia and yet he did. I think he is counting on #protests, unrest and even a coup. In the meantime, #Saakaschwili is on #hunger strike. #Zelensky is concerned. I wonder if #Ukraine will have a "diplomatic war" with Georgia
@VeraVanHorne #Saakashvili certainly consulted with #Washington about his plans and option of being arrested. I wouldn't be surprised that over this weekend we'll see #protests in #Georgia or even an attempt of a coup. He knew about a warrant for his arrest. Let's see how #Ukraine will behave
#Ukraine 🇺🇦 is now the 17th country I have visited. Way back when I attended @BCIT, my professor told me, “17 is your destiny.” He was right!

Saakashvili demanded a meeting with the 🇺🇦 consul. Did not understand! So he came to Georgia as a citizen of #Ukraine? Then why is he campaigning for the elections as a citizen of #Georgia? And if he considers himself a citizen of 🇬🇪 , then why does he need a consul of 🇺🇦?🤔
