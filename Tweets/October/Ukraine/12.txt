@ChristopherJM It's tough to judge about real covid19 situation in rebel held areas of #Donbass. However, we know for sure that cases of #covid19 in #Ukraine is under reported &amp; vaccination rate is very low. If we trust Ukrainian official data only today 352 have died due to #coronavirus.
@ChristopherJM Those charges are clearly made up against the leader of #Ukrainian #opposition party #Medvedchuk in #Ukraine. It's the part of the same campaign to #censor #FreedomOfSpeech, oppress #media outlets on TV and online in Ukraine by #Zelensky administration.
