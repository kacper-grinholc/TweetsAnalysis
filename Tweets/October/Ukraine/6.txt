@steven_pifer Yes, &amp; in addition to the continuing #Russian aggression against #Ukraine in the Donbas, Russia is illegally occupying a portion of that region.
@RutheniaRus You can tell when they are working for #Moscow when they simply say #Russia “annexed #Crimea” rather than “Russia invaded &amp; now illegally occupies #Ukraine ‘s Crimean peninsula”. The other giveaway is use of the word “conflict” as it connotes “aggression from both sides” (a lie).

The more Ukraine can depart from its previous #Yanukovych style leadership the better it shall be.

Agree with @antonioguterres and that is what we don’t do locally @ZelenskyyUa. We can’t handle eastern conflicts immediately but we can improve our future now by taking care about teachers in #Ukraine in order to grow up new #generation of doers and thinkers, instead of bribers.
