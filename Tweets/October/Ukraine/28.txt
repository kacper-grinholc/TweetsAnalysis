77 years ago today #Ukraine was liberated from #Nazis. Its Prime Minister stated on this occasion- you will not believe it!- that his country was liberated by anti-Hitler coalition ( I.e. not by the Red Army). Politically motivated amnesia. They don’t hesitate to be ridiculous!
“#KYIV, #Ukraine (AP) — Truck driver Andriy Melnik never took the #coronavirus seriously. With a friend, he bought a #fake #vaccination certificate so his travel documents would appear in order when he hauled cargo to other parts of #Europe.”

Accretion of #NATO by incorporation of Georgia and #Ukraine is pure folly of the #Antichrist. By such intent, the Antichrist affirms that it is bent on mutually assured destruction. “MAD” aptly describes policy regarding more than just nuclear weapons. 
Goodnight #Ukraine. Stay safe on the frontline people and keep a sharp look out for Russia's orcs. Still need some views &amp; comments for my recent video, so lend a hand if able &gt;  
#France also disturbed by #Ukraine ‘s use of battle drone in #war zone of #Donbas. I’m beginning 2 think that Germany &amp; France r worried 4 Ukraine. #Russia will hit harder and UA still can’t go toe to toe in the ring. Yet, what else? Gotta defend ur turf.

Having seen #Azerbaijan brazen take back of territory from #Armenia in 2020, #Ukraine might be tempted to test out a similar scenario in #Donbas. However, #Georgia failure against #Russia in 2008 should warn Kyiv against it. How would #Turkey play this out?

#Ukraine must be honest when dealing with Germany and France for its own national interest.  Germany and France are working with Russia to capitulate Ukraine to some tiny oblast.    Be honest. Please stop sugar coating this façade of Western unity. When Ukraine is being destroyed
