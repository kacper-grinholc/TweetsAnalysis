President Zelenskyy has met with the president of Israel Isaac Herzog.  The pair will later visit the Babyn Yar memorial.  #ukraine #zelenskiy_official #isreal #diplomacy #ukilifeabroad

@StandWithUs @Isaac_Herzog President of #Israel is visiting #Ukraine for a memorial service due to 80th anniversary of #BabiYar. It's extremely important to tell #Zelensky, lawmakers, Ukrainian public that it's unacceptable to glorify Ukrainians who took a part along with #Nazi to murder #Jews in #WWII.
#Ukraine is unlikely to change its strategic course and even form anything close to a multi-vector approach. 
@DefendingHistor @kaunas2022 @ADL @LithuanianJews @Europarl_EN @USEmbVilnius @TimesofIsrael I have the same question for #Zelensky of #Ukraine. When cities and towns will remove public glorification of Ukrainian Nazi collaborators. So far, nothing has been done. Total shame.
@Isaac_Herzog I hope you had an opportunity to tell president #Zelensky of #Ukraine that it's  unacceptable for Ukraine to continue to glorify #Ukrainian #Nazi collaborators during #Holocaust. Ukraine continues to glorify those who were directly implicated in #WWII crimes against the #Jews.
Meanwhile in #Ukraine   Note from the resource "#Ukrainian format".  "Powerful Ukrainian cop) How did he pass Physical tests ??))".

@Isaac_Herzog It's important to tell the truth even if it's tough. Your speech at Ukrainian parliament Rada has been cancelled by #Ukraine's officials. Former president Rivlin told the truth to lawmakers about dark pages in Ukrainian history when Ukrainians collaborated with #Nazi during #WWII
