Military reclamation of #Ukraine underway, it creates threat for Russia, - #Putin
#Putin tells Valdai Discussion Club #Ukraine's military development (with Western backing) "really poses a threat to #Russia."  Someone should explain to him what Kyiv spent on defense in 2013. There's reason why it has gone up and is getting Western support since then.
