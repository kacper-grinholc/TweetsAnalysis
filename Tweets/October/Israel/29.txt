Last wk, the @Jerusalem_Post ⬇️ connected Halabi’s case to the recent declaration by #Israel that 6 #Palestinian human rights organisations are “terrorist” groups – in effect suggesting that skepticism about the charges is reasonable...  @POTUS @SecBlinken  
“claiming rights before a UN or other international body is not an act of terrorism, advocating for the rights of women in the occupied #Palestinian territory is not terrorism, and providing legal aid to detained #Palestinians is not terrorism”. #Israel  
The @UN_HRC has held #Israel to a double standard. The council’s Agenda Item 7 requires an assessment of Israel’s human rights record at every session — a burden no other country bears — violating the #UNHRC’s commitment to non-selectivity:

@KenRoth The real question is why you continue to pretend the designated NGOs do not have ties to the PFLP, despite ample publicly available evidence to the contrary? Then, again, anyone who has witnessed your compulsive anti-#Israel obsession already knows the answer to that question.

The term “#NGO” is one of those difficult-to-decipher acronyms that frequently. Yet, given the current climate of worldwide antisemitism and increased anti-#Israel sentiments, the term is quite significant and bears explanation.
