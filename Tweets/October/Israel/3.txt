@haivri @AmitAmitbarak1 Glad to see #Israel beginning to open up but it's too little. Israel needs to open to vaccinated individual tourists for there to be a meaningful positive impact on the economy and public relations. Hope that will happen soon now that the #Covid rate is dropping rapidly
This is very odd‼️ Reason being; to field such a system realistically would mean #Hizbollah, an irregular #terrorist group, finding people to operate it with many years of training⁉️  It’s got no chance of stopping #Israel’s F35s, so why the effort? What do they even want it for?

@ForeignPolicy As a peace processor, Dennis Ross has a perfect record of never having been right about anything in the #MiddleEast. This article hasn't changed that. The #Iraqi notables who endorsed peace with #Israel have already backed down following death threats.
#Palestinian president says to go for other choices if #Israel rejects two-state solution  #Palestine
🇺🇸 #US Military to Withdraw Hundreds of Troops, Aircraft, #THAAD and #patriot From #Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦   ⚠️These are withdrawn to #Israel🇮🇱   ⚠️In the case of an #Azerbaijan 🇦🇿 -#Iran 🇮🇷conflict, Israel taking into account its ties with Baku, will enter war 
When #UNGA isn't aware of rules and #Israel oppressor State crosses the limit; I appreciate #Cuba for doing the right thing. World stands with #Palestine against oppressive Israel. How come Israel claims to be only representative of Jews? A religious branding?

@michaeltanchum The last sentence of the article is  one of the reasons #Iran 🇮🇷 showed its muscles + the factor of #Israel 🇮🇱!  Only after this we can speak abt drills leading Az 🇦🇿 &amp; Turkey 🇹🇷 to do the drills (already the 4th or 5th if not mistaken)
The epitome of hypocrisy for all to see #Israel 
Palestinian President #MahmoudAbbas said that #Israel’s rejection of the two-state solution will oblige the #Palestinians to go for other political choices
VP @KamalaHarris wrongly accuses #Israel of #ethnic #Genocide, yet has nothing to say about the MASS genocide of #Christians by #Muslim #Terrorists in #Nigeria.
@swilkinsonbc @RobinSadieh How despicable and depraved can some humans be …in #israel settlers are above the law, they’re criminals who walk free committing one crime after the next while being sheltered by the 4th strongest army in the world.
