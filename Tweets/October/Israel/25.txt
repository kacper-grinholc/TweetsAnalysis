It goes against the norms of our society to be unwelcoming whether to the people of #Israel or to others. The only road to understanding &amp; setting our differences aside is through communicating and keeping our doors open  #Bahrain #البحرين #Manama
What Bahrainis reject are the voices of destruction, the supporters of foreign agendas and those with a negative attitude towards a promising future  #Bahrain #Israel #Manama #البحرين #AbrahamAccords
Israel’s Defense Ministry said the groups have ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a left-wing faction with an armed wing that has carried out deadly attacks against Israelis.  #israel #defense #ngo

*11*   The other thing to be aware of is that #WannaBe 'greater' #Israel is in progress!  They seek #WorldDomination across every nation which is why, more than ever, we #Need2Unite &amp; give them #TheMiddleFinger!   #HowDareThey!  #iAmPalestine  #iAmStandingRock  #MniWiconi  #IDWP 
A beauty queen inside and out, former Miss Iraq @RealSarahIdan tells @MissUniverse contestants to stay confident in the face of bigoted calls to boycott #Israel. 
We welcome the Israeli cabinet's approval of a plan to invest $9.4 billion in #Israel's Arab communities.  From education to infrastructure to jobs, this historic investment is a key step toward improving life for all Israelis. 
A pause: Though secret visits were reported (between #Sudan and #Israel) since the #AbrahamAccords deal, this seemed the weakest and least sincere of the 4 deals. Shall we just "forget about it"? For Israel there were strategic advantages in Sudan's geography, but many headaches.
@SenatorDurbin it’s time to defend civil society human rights orgs “Failure to reverse the course in #Israel will surely undermine efforts to prevent a similar lurch toward closing off dissent &amp; human rights monitors in other countries.” #StandWithThe6 
#Israel's National Security Council on Monday canceled a travel warning that had been in effect for more than a decade. 
What a time to be alive!  The head of the #UAE Air Force touched down in #Israel for a visit during the country’s massive #BlueFlag military exercise.  #IsraelUAE #Peace #Jewish #Muslim #RealPeace #MiddleEast #IDF #F35 #AirForce 
. @RepRashida The problem, as any honest person will admit, is the co-opting of such groups from time to time (possibly by coercion) by organizations like #Hamas.  If #Israel has evidence, it should share it. If it won't, then the world should reject guilt by association.
Amen to that! #Peace #Israel #AbrahamAccords 
After today's coup by the military in #Sudan, it is only logical that the #US decided to rescind $700M of help. The whole aid package was conditional on the peace accord with #Israel. What will the new junta in power in #Khartoum do now?
This is not ok @IsraeliPM when you yourself are an occupation regime committing #CrimesAgainstHumanity at a daily basis in #Palestine?  SHAME ON YOU #Israel  @Utenriksdept @Stortinget  UD overrasket over Israels terrorstempling av menneskerettsgrupper 
Who in the world support such brutality? #USA #Israel 
#Iraqis will overwhelmingly continue to reject normalizing relations with #Israel.
"The inaugural meeting between the foreign ministers of #India, #Israel, the [#UAE], and the [#US] is a significant development...Interestingly,...three members of this quad had met together the previous week in Washington..." @KaramDana @nerminallam 
#Aotearoa #NewZealand's response to the pandemic does not constitute "apartheid." Read @hrw for a factual account of where authorities are committing the crimes against humanity of apartheid &amp; persecution today:  TLDR? #Israel #nzpol 
@kaas_couscous A like is inappropriate but that's social media. This ethnic cleansing makes the 🇮🇱 a modern day #swastika Speaking about "les mains sales": #Israel is waging a dirty, an extremely dirty war. And so does everyone who defends it. @MinPres

US State Department says #SUDAN's normalisation deal with #ISRAEL will be re-evaluated following today's events - military coup.   Sudan &amp; Israel agreed to normalise relations in Oct last year, in a deal sealed with now ousted PM Abdalla Hamdok &amp; Transitional Council Head Burhan.
“Eliezer” means “God is my help” in Hebrew and the letters/numbers add up to 318—which is the same number mentioned in Genesis 14:14. Without God, Abraham wouldn’t have defeated the four kings nor been able to offer a tenth of the spoils of war to Melchizedek. 👑 #Israel #Hebrew 
Within the framework of cooperation and joint coordination between #UAE and #Israel to move forward towards recovery from the repercussions of #COVID19, they signed a memorandum of understanding to facilitate the movement of travelers. 👍👍👍
#Israel has no good choices in #Sudan's conflict, except to wait and see and not be viewed as partisan to what is taking place.  What do you think? 
#UAE and #Israel signed a memorandum of understanding on mutual recognition of vaccination certificates issued by health authorities in both countries 🤝🤝🤝
