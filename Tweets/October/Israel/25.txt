It goes against the norms of our society to be unwelcoming whether to the people of #Israel or to others. The only road to understanding &amp; setting our differences aside is through communicating and keeping our doors open  #Bahrain #ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ≠ÿ±ŸäŸÜ #Manama
What Bahrainis reject are the voices of destruction, the supporters of foreign agendas and those with a negative attitude towards a promising future  #Bahrain #Israel #Manama #ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿ≠ÿ±ŸäŸÜ #AbrahamAccords
Israel‚Äôs Defense Ministry said the groups have ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a left-wing faction with an armed wing that has carried out deadly attacks against Israelis.  #israel #defense #ngo

A beauty queen inside and out, former Miss Iraq @RealSarahIdan tells @MissUniverse contestants to stay confident in the face of bigoted calls to boycott #Israel. 
We welcome the Israeli cabinet's approval of a plan to invest $9.4 billion in #Israel's Arab communities.  From education to infrastructure to jobs, this historic investment is a key step toward improving life for all Israelis. 
A pause: Though secret visits were reported (between #Sudan and #Israel) since the #AbrahamAccords deal, this seemed the weakest and least sincere of the 4 deals. Shall we just "forget about it"? For Israel there were strategic advantages in Sudan's geography, but many headaches.
@SenatorDurbin it‚Äôs time to defend civil society human rights orgs ‚ÄúFailure to reverse the course in #Israel will surely undermine efforts to prevent a similar lurch toward closing off dissent &amp; human rights monitors in other countries.‚Äù #StandWithThe6 
#Israel's National Security Council on Monday canceled a travel warning that had been in effect for more than a decade. 
What a time to be alive!  The head of the #UAE Air Force touched down in #Israel for a visit during the country‚Äôs massive #BlueFlag military exercise.  #IsraelUAE #Peace #Jewish #Muslim #RealPeace #MiddleEast #IDF #F35 #AirForce 
. @RepRashida The problem, as any honest person will admit, is the co-opting of such groups from time to time (possibly by coercion) by organizations like #Hamas.  If #Israel has evidence, it should share it. If it won't, then the world should reject guilt by association.
Amen to that! #Peace #Israel #AbrahamAccords 
After today's coup by the military in #Sudan, it is only logical that the #US decided to rescind $700M of help. The whole aid package was conditional on the peace accord with #Israel. What will the new junta in power in #Khartoum do now?

‚ÄúEliezer‚Äù means ‚ÄúGod is my help‚Äù in Hebrew and the letters/numbers add up to 318‚Äîwhich is the same number mentioned in Genesis 14:14. Without God, Abraham wouldn‚Äôt have defeated the four kings nor been able to offer a tenth of the spoils of war to Melchizedek. üëë #Israel #Hebrew
