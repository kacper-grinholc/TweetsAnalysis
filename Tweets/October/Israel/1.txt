#Israel and the regime are two comrades, they never attack each other. You know this well, but you are hiding it. In fact, both arms are there. Destroy the whole of Iran.  It has made us miserable😏
When #Iran was run by the dictarorial king, #Israel had no problem. When #Iranians toppled him, #Israelis conspiracy about Iran started from that day to today, which it itself is created on &amp; has hijacked the #Jewish faith under #Zionism. Shabbat Shalom D 
You have won a battle @_EdwardIsaacs not a war. David will appeal and the fight to show the world what an #Apartheid regime #israel is will continue. Appeal and #employmenttribrunal coming #Freepalestine #BDS

VP Harris reassuring Jews that #Israel isn’t guilty of ethnic cleansing is one thing, validating an Arab student’s belief that a lie is true is outrageous and dangerous. @VP should tell the Palestinians the truth.  via @politico

The botched pro-#Israel #Erbil conference is as promising in contributing to #MidEast peace as were the #Palestinian #Village_Leagues in 1978. At least #Dudin lasted few weeks more than #Hardan who has already recanted his statements claiming to have been tricked by organizers. 
Happy #InternationalCoffeeDay!    Pictured is a Druze man pounding coffee beans and then serving coffee from a traditional pot in his restaurant in the Galilee region of #Israel.   #ShabbatShalom!   Photo: Itamar Grinberg for the Israeli Ministry of Tourism 
@ClintWarren6 @YousefMunayyer Several tweets with personal insults rather than evidence of #Apartheid in #Israel. This is what losing the argument looks like.

@IntlCrimCourt @ICCBA_ABCPI When starts the prosecution of #Israel?
ALERT: "The [#Iran's] war with #Israel has already started," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman #SaeedKhatibzadeh told #Maariv
@Crepuscuphile @OANN Which is why 50% of the hospitalizations in #Israel are from those taking the ever failing gene therapy.
Solidarity w/ @Tracking_Power a respected professor fired from @BristolUni under #Israel lobby pressure for criticising a vile apartheid regime ideology. Spineless. Then again our corrupt politicians allow this foreign interference. #IStandWithDavidMiller 
Summary: an 18-year-old wanted to go viral by getting into a fight with @VP, and @KamalaHarris didn't take the bait.  Besides for the show of how misinformed &amp; radicalized young people are about #Israel, this is a non-story. 
This is brilliant! #Israel #Palestine #Peace 
After death threats, #Iraqis who attended pro-#Israel normalization summit recant

Article angry #Israel uses antisemitism to shut criticism, thinks describing Israel as "occupation state" is criticism. Such label delegitimizes existence of Israel, not attack policies of its governments. Article thinks its fallacy is a slam dunk case.
Yet another UK entity caves in to the apartheid #Israel lobby out to destroy anyone who criticises that racist illegal occupying state &amp; its racist ideology. Shame on @BristolUni mind you they did that to Corbyn too w/the help of treacherous politicians who support apartheid!

On Sunday over a million of people in #Israel will lose their #vaccinepassport due to rejecting the #thirddose.  Domenica oltre un milione di persone in #Israele perderanno il #greenpass per non aver fatto il #booster.   #NoGreenPass #NoVaccinePassports 
Dear #Bahrain you are better off with this friend #Israel than without. 
@grange_hillel Just hold the tongue of the aggressive #Zionist  You're an outpost there in #Israel ... even many of the Jewish Diaspora disagree with those of you espousing &amp; acting against the #Human decency WE #love and hold dear. No matter religion or culture  You're fighting a losing battle
ICYMI Short essay clearly and concisely captures the reality for #Jewish-#Zionist students on far too many 🇺🇸 campuses, where they’re being vilified, ostracized and demoralized even as #Israel 🇮🇱 is increasingly becoming normalized, accepted &amp; welcomed in the Middle East. ☹️😞☹️
