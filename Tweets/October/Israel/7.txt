@mishtal @huwaidaarraf If #fakenews, wouldn't @Nike push back on this *false* narrative that'll surely put them in the sights of an #Antisemitism smear campaign? Instead they said doing business in #Israel “no longer match[es] the company’s policy &amp; goals.” Sounds pro-#BDS  🤷

@trtworld “Nike has decided to end the sale of its products in Israeli stores.”  It is neither a politically motivated decision nor does it relate to any religious aspect.   Nike has simply mentioned business reasons for this decision.  #Nike @Nike #Israel #USA #Sportswear #Joggers #Shoes

The citizens of the State of Israel have been shaken by the war of Yom Kippur in which we lost many sons. We bow our heads in memory of those dear sons who fought for the country and fell in battle.  #VisionForIsrael #yomkippur #Israel #victimsofterror #israelunderfire

@AsaWinstanley If #US anti #BDS laws bans companies from refusing to do business in #Israel controlled territories, as they do in #Illinois, then wouldn't this make #paypal refusal to provide services to the #Palestinians in those territories illegal?
Everything is always last minute in #Israel and the final confirmation of the new Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) Director “R” will be no different. 
@Ilhan One correction, we pay child care in #Israel 🥸
Just the latest e.g. of how delusional those who profess to speak for the #Palestinians continue to be.  @daoudkuttab's post is full of empty threats;  no recognition that the needed leverage has long been MIA:   #MiddleEast #Israel #KeepDigging
