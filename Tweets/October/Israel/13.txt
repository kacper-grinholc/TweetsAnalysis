The #occupation will end the very moment Israelis feel safe ending it. Nobody (other than the far right) wants it to continue. Pressuring #Israel while doing nothing to make it more confident in its security is a doomed strategy. 10/10
The #occupation is a bad thing, but you won't end it by beating #Israel into submission. We've seen now that broad peace is possible in the ME without first resolving the #Palestinian issue: this is an opportunity for new thinking. 8/
In short, this is yet another misguided effort by the far left to punish #Israel for perceived sins without moving the area even 1 inch closer to peace. 7/
While 2SSA has teeth when it comes to enforcing #Israel's compliance, it merely "encourage[s] the  Palestinians to reform their so-called #payToSlay practice" of cash rewards to the families of #terrorists. "Encourage". "Reform". Yeah OK. 5/
2SSA would classify #Gaza, from which #Israel withdrew in 2005, as land "occupied" by Israel.  @RepAndyLevin and @jstreetdotorg infantilize Gazans and ignore stark reality on the ground by making Israel responsible for the sins of #Hamas /4
