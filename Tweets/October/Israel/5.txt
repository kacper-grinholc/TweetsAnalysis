@queeralamode @AOC This is truly sad to see from @AOC  We/I've always supported AOC, her values, her strength.  But this? To vote in favour of giving money to a country that's killing innocent men, women and children...and taking their homes and land. Unforgivable  #Apartheid #Israel

@haynesdeborah @SkyNews The way #Qatar is trying to rescue every single human being that wants/needs to flee #Afghanistan reminds me of the way #Israel takes care of its civilians. Only that Qatar is taking care of #US and #UK civilians, which makes it even more extraordinary.
Once again, the State of #Israel, born of the unimaginable devastation of the Holocaust, is patronized by the spiritually slothful Evangelical Right. These "Christians" are so busy using Israel as a holy relic that they forget it's made up of actual
