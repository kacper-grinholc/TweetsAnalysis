#Israel labels six #Palestinian civil society groups #'terrorist,' setting challenge for d - Oct 22 @ 7:48 PM ET 
#AlHaq was awarded the Human Rights Prize of the French Republic three years ago.  #Israel brands @alhaq_org a "terrorist organization" today as it's easier to smear than face up to the litany of human rights abuses and war crimes their research has exposed. 
I wonder if Candice Owens or Ted Cruz will call out the Israeli government for this? Oh wait, Palestinian’s aren’t white……ooops, I mean part of the West. #Israel #SaveAustralia
