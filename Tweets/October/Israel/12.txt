“Beautiful World” explores the life and romance of intellectual, urbane millennials.  #sallyrooney won’t let novel be published in Hebrew  Big loss for the #Israel reading public 🤡 
Many #Israeli media &amp; social media users from "#Israel" have come out full force against the #Irish novelist Sally Rooney for her #SolidarityWithPalestine but the Israeli media don't condemn the #terrorist attacks against #Palestinian people &amp; dispect for the deceased⬇️#Hypocrisy 
How much longer must we tolerate .@UKLabour support for #Israel’s ⤵️ crimes vs #Palestinians? .@AngelaRayner  .@lisanandy  .@Ed_Miliband .@JonAshworth  .@DrRosena  .@DavidLammy  .@JessPhillips .@RachelReeves .@wesstreeting  .@YvetteCooperMP #StarmerOut #LabourIsRacist #EndRacism 
Any recommendations for a #Israel trip from folks who have been there? Would love to go. 🇮🇱 
@IfNotNowOrg A day after Indigenous Peoples Day is celebrated in the US and here are the Arabs, picking on the Indigenous People of #Israel, the Jews. Makes no sense.
it is not you (#gentile #convert) who support the root but the root (#Israel) supports you. Romans 11:18 TLV #Torah 
The #Irish novelist Sally Rooney has decided not to publish her new novel "Beautiful World, Where Are You?" in #Hebrew, in solidarity with #Palestinian people &amp; in support of the cultural boycott of '#Israel'. #Palestine #PalestinianLivesMatter #BDS 
Except @SpeakerPelosi: (1) Supports the appeasing and disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which threatens #Israel. (2) In the last Congress, she didn't bring up anti-BDS legislation that passed the Senate. (3) Has endorsed the re-election of pro-BDS Reps. @IlhanMN and @RashidaTlaib. 
A lot of information is provided in this 17-minute video. Covering 4,000 years of #history in a really engaging way, "The Real History of #Israel" is well worth a watch. 
#israel  Anyone notice that work permits to Gaza went unreported by "THEM" media outlets. I guess any positive Israeli action deserves to be hushed up and punished.

Does anybody believe that the #FordeReport report will be published while @UKLabour and many MPs are owned by #Israel and the Jewish lobby, and it has a pro-#Zionist leader who has a Jewish wife?
Israel formally agreed to double the amount of freshwater it provides to its neighbor Jordan.  Foreign Minister Yair Lapid: "This is what good neighbors do. It's another step in the cooperation between #Israel and #Jordan in tackling our joint challenges" 
“The two will discuss a series of diplomatic, security and economic issues involving both countries, as well as important regional matters, primarily Iran’s nuclear program,” the Prime Minister’s Office said.  #russia #israel #syria #iran

@DocMartinDub @NaomiOhReally #Hamas gets billions from other countries and yet the #Palestinian people in #Gaza suffer terribly. Where is the money? Did their leaders build themselves palaces? Do the dig tunnels to terrorize #Israel? Yes they do.

Halftime: 🇮🇱 #Israel 1, 🇲🇩 #Moldova 0. It’s been a pretty even game to be honest but Israel has been much sharper near the box. It shows with Zahavi’s record-setting goal.

How is the former Ambassador to #Israel involved in this #moneylaundering enterprise?  Was there an #RCMP cover-up? Who's interfered with the administration of justice?  @ABEnterprise #banking #insurance  #lawtwitter #PandoraPapers #PandoraLeaks

If this is not clear evidence on the main British Jewish representative body @BoardofDeputies doing the bidding and exerting influence on British gov foreign policy ( with ref to foreign state #Israel's racist Jewish supremacy led Zionism, then what is it? 
Reminder that the US gov allows this to happen by giving its unconditional support &amp; finances to #Israel: #Gaza’s undrinkable water ‘slowly poisoning’ #Palestinians  #FreePalestine
Another #BDS controversy: is @sallyRooney being hypocritical? Some people think so. If you’re going to publish in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia, why won’t you publish in #Israel? #boycott

29’ GOOOOOAAAAALLL #ISRAEL 🇮🇱  Israel goes in a classic counter attack, Solomon cuts in from the left, finds Zahavi at the top of the box and he perfectly placed a low shot into the far corner. Who else but Zahavi who continues to be on fire.  🇮🇱1-0🇲🇩
A message to Israel, United States, every fake democratic government and all capitalist companies. People that own most of the power and influence the world for good or bad.  This is a thread... #Israel #IsraeliApartheid #freepalastine #FarmerProtest #FJBiden #BrexitIsntWorking
