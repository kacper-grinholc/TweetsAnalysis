Israel to build 1,300 new West Bank settler homes  "About 475,000 Israeli Jews live in settlements in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law."  via @AJEnglish  #Israel #Bennett #Zionism

"#Israel is planning to build more than 1,300 more homes in the occupied #WestBank. The number adds to some 2,000 approved in August and increases fears for an already elusive peace process" 
I think the USG's call for "clarification" about #Israel's designation of 6 #humanrights group as #terrorist organizations (or #terrorist adjacent to PFLP) is prudent; I also think the immediate and unrestrained condemnation of #Israel by the #progressive community is telling.
