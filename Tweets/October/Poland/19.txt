@WojtekJanicki @ManfredWeber @EU_Commission If the people in Poland define sovereignty in not honering their contractual obligations and the standards they agreed to in joining the #EU, #Poland is free to do the #Polexit. Nobody forced #Poland in the #EU and like the UK Poland is free to leave.

Folks, I try to be fair. I am always asking myself if it can happen in Europe what happens in the U.S. Are there evil players as well. And I spotted something. #Poland is currently an outlaw to the E.U.  They will fold, once they get their contributions docked. Had their moment.
This was what was prevented in UK by our leaving - the EU can't dictate the law to member states like #Poland because they're sovereign countries. 
The people of #Poland need to stand and be counted in opposition to their anti EU government.   They should not look at the British, who sold them to the Russians after WWII, as an example for the future.  #Newsnight #Brexit

#Poland #EU,Ursula von der Leyen: "I deeply regret that we find ourselves in this situation.I have always been a proponent of dialogue and I will always be.This is a situation that can and must be resolved.And we want a strong Poland in a united Europe".
At the same time, there needs to be a clear criticism of Poland's anti-human policy and solidarity with the broad protests against sealing off and pushbacks in many places in #Poland! Whether in Greece, #Libya, Poland or Germany - human rights are #nonnegotiable everywhere.
In order to guarantee a safe way for people seeking protection, Germany must accept people from #Poland through direct relocation quotas and contribute to easing the situation. #Belarus
There, they are defencelessly exposed to the cold, rain and hunger, held down by soldiers and fenced in with Nato wire. At least six people have already died there, some directly after violent pushbacks. #Belarus #Poland
For weeks, the situation in the Belarusian-Polish border area has been catastrophic. People trying to flee to the EU via #Belarus are systematically forced back from #Poland into a militarily sealed-off buffer zone.
