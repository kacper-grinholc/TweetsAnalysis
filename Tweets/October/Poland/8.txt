Court ruling puts Poland on a collision course with the EU’s legal order   #Poland leaders do not belong to the democratic world.
"Concerns" over the independence of the Constitutional Tribunal of #Poland is an understatement. A great read from a couple years ago is this paper by @WojSadurski, showing how #PiS has actively undermined the tribunal since coming to power: 
Don't be fooled: the #RuleOfLaw crisis in #Poland is not  about the legal question whether the constitution has supremacy over #EU law; the point is that the unlawfully constituted "Constitutional Tribunal" is used to provide a legitimation to destroy the separation of powers.

'The EU economy commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, last month said the case could have “possible consequences” for Poland’s recovery funds, remarks Warsaw called “blackmail' #ausbiz #Poland #EU
