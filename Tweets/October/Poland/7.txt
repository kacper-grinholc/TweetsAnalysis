The biggest fear of the #EU is that #Poland does not leave and simply vetos changes it does not like.  That would be far more destructive than #Brexit.

What the actual fuck is happening in Poland? The Constitutional Tribunal has considered polish state law as greater than European Union's one. We're getting closer and closer to the Polexit. Please, stop this shit and don't let it happen! #Polexit  #Poland

As we all start to discuss what powers the EU has now on #Poland, the question arises about whether Article 50 can used to kick a country out.   That’s not possible as per below.   “Commencing the process is up to the member state that intends to leave.” 
When #poland does not believe that the European Court of Justice is above their local court, the #EU should consider that Poland has broken the agreement and close its borders.  Unfortunately, the EU is slow.

#Poland's Constitutional Court Tribunal rules per majority that Article 1 &amp; Article 19 of the Treaty of the European Union are incompatible with the country's Constitution. ↨ How's Pandora's Box in Polish?
These are key provisions for the following reasons: 1. Art 1 TEU establishes the EU &amp; outlines its founding documents. Rejecting this article as unconstitutional, means leaving the EU legal order, i.e. EU because #Poland joined the EU by committing in law to respect the Treaties 
Enjoy all things #Poland related? Here's something I just learned: James Bond's connection to Poland!
