#Poland's Constitutional Court Tribunal rules per majority that Article 1 &amp; Article 19 of the Treaty of the European Union are incompatible with the country's Constitution. ‚Ü® How's Pandora's Box in Polish?
These are key provisions for the following reasons: 1. Art 1 TEU establishes the EU &amp; outlines its founding documents. Rejecting this article as unconstitutional, means leaving the EU legal order, i.e. EU because #Poland joined the EU by committing in law to respect the Treaties

the red-robed people at Germany's @BVerfG are not lonely anymore in their fight against the EU's basic legal order. #Poland's constitutional tribunal just placed the country's basic law above the EU treaties. 
Time for #Poland to leave the EU if it doesn't want to abide by EU laws. 
The Polish Constitutional Court. A summary. #Poland #Polexit

@tom_nuttall @ConStelz They should have thought about it when they joined #EU. How many Euros of European taxpayers have been spent in #Poland in the mean time? And do the Poles really want #Polexit ? A kind of judicial coup ordered by the #Pis-governement?
