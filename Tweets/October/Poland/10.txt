Yes, it *could* well be a simple solution. Already in place in #CzechRepublic, #Denmark, and #Poland (plus #Norway in #EFTA).  It would seem in economic interest of #Spain to follow these examples and grant  #LimitedTerritorialValidity visas. 
In addition to #Schengen 90/180-day rule, nationals of FOURTEEN named states are permitted to spend EXTRA 3 months per 6-month period visa-free in #Poland - regardless of time spent in other Schengen countries. If Poles can do it, why not #Spain too??

Opponents of #Polexit:  #Poland #EuropeanUnion #EU #Europe #populism?
You can bet your bottom dollar, an EU-funded group paid for that huge EU flag for this pro-EU march in #Poland  The EU always has its grubby tentacles deep within "grassroots" activism.  Poland - don't let yourselves be manipulated by the EU. You can achieve #Polexit and prosper.

In the conclusion, I pointed to the possible political use (and abuse) of sovereignty, and protection of the country, as roots of Euroscepticism, contributing to this volume  yet, it is not likely to lead to decreasing levels of popular opposition #Poland

Pro #EU rally was held in #Warsaw #Poland to defend the membership and demonstrate against the anti European Union policies of the current far right Polish government.
While I still don't think that #PiS wants to take us out, we should show that many of us do respect the primacy of #EU law, and understand that if Members pick which laws apply to them, the 🇪🇺 can no longer be united.  Some pics from today's protests. No. 1 - #Warsaw   #Poland 
#Poland did not suffer German &amp; Soviet occupation plus 40+ years under communist dictatorship, gain its freedom, only to be controlled by another bureaucracy under the #EU. If the Constitutional Courts are not supreme than no EU-member nation is free.

@RidgeOnSunday @KwasiKwarteng if the EU can put sanctions against Belarus for the migratory pressure on #Lithuania #Latvia &amp; #Poland why can't we do it against the EU and France for the same reasons. as its the same rule  @BorisJohnson   @pritipatel   @EmmanuelMacron   @vonderleyen
After Brexit comes Pexit? Poland ‘takes back control’ by placing national law first   Polexit fears are stoked by a court ruling that decisions by the EU’s highest court are incompatible with #Poland’s constitution --&gt;   #Polexit #Pexit #Poland #Brexit 
@EurovisionJr Can't wait! #Poland 🇵🇱  #SaraJames ❤️
Please help save #Poland pleads @donaldtusk 
#Polexit a clear and present danger for belligerent #EU. #Poland largely pro-EU but even #France and @donaldtusk aware of dangers of anti-EU sentiment. Tusk failed to stop #Brexit. @BorisJohnson #UK can offer Poland mutually beneficial trade deal options.
We are no longer in the #EU @simoncoveney and @vonderleyen cannot dictate to us! .. not even to #Poland it seems… the EU is a trading bloc not a country that has conquered its members…@MartinSelmayr may disagree…. 
#Poland says it will continue to respect #EU law, but it cannot accept interpretations that violate its constitution. On Thursday, Poland's top court ruled some EU laws are incompatible with the country's constitution - a major challenge to the legal framework of EU.

Thinking of my lovely mama today, on what would have been her 90th birthday. Deported to Siberia aged 9, she rarely spoke about her childhood. #WWII #Poland #warchild #siberianexile 
The constitutional court of the Republic of #Poland ruled that the #Polish constitution trumped #EU law.  Foreign Ministry of Poland:  #Poland will continue to respect #EuropeanUnion law. 
#Poland will continue to respect #European Union law, its foreign ministry said on Saturday, after the country’s Constitutional Tribunal ruled that parts of EU law were incompatible with Poland’s #constitution. 
@MaZaborowski #Poland has pretty much triggered Article 50.  Not sure it really matters what they think
#NordStream2 can still be stoped if #Poland takes the matter to the European Court of justice (on the grounds that #NS2 is not economic) It’s a pity though that Poland has recently undermined the EU court by ruling that its verdicts do not supersede national laws
#WorthReading #Poland #Polen #Democracy #migrationcrisis #polexit   If you want to know what Polish democrats feel and think about the actual situation in Poland 
@Mariush1515 And #Poland had the veto liberum, the essential prerequisite of the Polish partitions.  But there will be no fourth Polish partition.  No, this time #Russia will have it all.  Thanks to Jarosław #Kaczyński.  #Polexit
