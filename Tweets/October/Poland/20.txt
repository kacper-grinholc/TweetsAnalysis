The #Baltics, #Poland, #Norway are concerned about what they see as  Russian threat, follow the US. Poland wants to contain #Iran. #Germany, #UK, #Holland support the #IranDeal with Washington. #France also support the #JCPOA but confronts the #Jihadists even without the US.
Quite Right, @pisorgpl ! #Poland will stay Free. 
In order to prevent rising illegal #immigration, the cooperation between #Poland and #Germany on the border of the two countries should be strengthened and joint patrols should be carried out, #German Interior Minister #HorstSeehofer has said.

Opinion💭by Gabriël Moens  A major constitutional crisis is currently brewing in the #EuropeanUnion.  The Polish Constitutional Court recently decided some European laws and decisions of the EU's high court conflict with #Poland’s constitution. 
You need to understand none is never a slave, never owned by anyone etc etc   It is violating human rights... All rules that violate human rights are illegal in #EU and #poland and any country, they all lose at all times, when they violater that... So thats the point here.
its extortion etc   #EU can only be against #poland if it #violates #humanrights and many EU countries do and #EU did nothing... thus we must have #tribunals against #EU anyway... It already lost sovereignty many times, thus is not existing, nor legal, it tries as rebellions
@BrugesGroup Hope that is not the case. With the anti-abortion, anti-gay and racist sentiment in #Poland I hope we're moving as far away from them as possible.

"I want to talk about women. Fighters, Polish women. I want to send a message: We won't abandon you. We have seen with pride and admiration your defense of your rights, bodies and freedoms." says @DianaRibaGiner. #Poland #DefendTheDefenders 
The link between women’s rights and the rule of law is a direct one. Women in #Poland are not only defending the right to decide over their bodies. They're freedom fighters, they're democracy fighters. It is our job to walk with them, to step up our game - you are not alone!

"The European Court of Human Rights has recognized the lack of access to abortion services as a violation of the right to family &amp; private life. All women across the EU should have equal access to good quality healthcare" says Commissioner @helenadalli in #EPlenary on #Poland. 
#Poland strengthened its border with neighboring #Belarus by adding nearly 3,000 soldiers as the country recently reported record-high migration levels, prompting stepped-up security measures, the defense minister said on Tuesday.

#VonderLeyen and EU Parliament mob came across as ‘small’, no match for leader of #Poland, who came well-prepared and delivered an excellent speech. Seemed like VDL speech written by EU clerks. This was not a debate but an EU show trial where judgement was known beforehand. #V4

Good news.  @MinPres @AlexanderDeCroo @SwedishPM: Response shouldn't be limited to ruling on EU law, but address how #Poland Govt used flawed courts to erode rights, incldg women's rights.  Time to move #Article7 to next steps.  Our take w/ 14 groups 👇👇   
🇵🇱 Detentions, smear campaigns, death threats. For the past year, the safety of women human rights defenders in #Poland has been put at great risk.  ❗@EU_Commission and member states must urgently address Poland's rule of law breaches and #DefendtheDefenders of women's rights.
📢 Since the ruling that virtually banned legal abortion in #Poland, women human rights defenders have faced an increasingly hostile environment in the country.  ⚠️ We join @fidh_en in calling on EU decision-makers to take urgent action and protect them 👉  
@RandomTroll_PL @Proudtobeeurop1 @MorawieckiM @PolandMFA You're wrong. Poland and Hungary are troublemakers just like the UK. They no longer belong in the EU and should leave just like the UK. #Poland  #Morawiecki

Mr Morawiecki have you seen who you have with you in ECR &amp; ID? The ones that have made politics against Polish plumbers &amp; truck drivers. 20 years ago they rejected #Poland's EU membership. I voted in favour. I want a strong Poland 🇵🇱 in the EU 🇪🇺. #RuleOfLaw

#Poland doubles troop contingent on border with #Belarus. #Germany has also offered to assist Poland with guarding operations. 🇵🇱also adopted legislation to make #pushbacks legal &amp; allow the arbitrary rejection of migrants' #asylum applications. 
Frankly, being preached by two tax heavens about ’undermining foundations of EU’, accounts for biggest absurd ever fostered by EU. Particularly when we’re talking about hitting someone in the purse.   #Poland #EU #Polska
