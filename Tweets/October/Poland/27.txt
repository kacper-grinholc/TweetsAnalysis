#NonUnited #Europe Court of Justice of the #EuropeanUnion has decided to fine #Poland by 1 million euros per day.  The decision was made because Warsaw failed to comply with a previous ruling by the Court, which called for the annulment of the Disciplinary Commission for Judges. 
Poland financially punished for its political control of judges and attorneys. The EU forces its member country to pay EUR 1 million a day for every day that the judicial court - which is under direct control of cons. govt party PiS - continues. #Poland #justice
Guys, are the @EUCourtPress decisions  still 'valid' in #Poland after 14th of October ?
President of #Poland Andrzej Duda has received the credentials of HE Dr Iman Ahmed Al Salami – the new Ambassador of the #UAE to Poland. Welcome to Poland, we look forward to having you at the Poland Pavilion at #Expo2020Dubai. @MoFAICUAE @prezydentpl 
#Poland fined 1 000 000 Euros a day by #EU for every day it decides to pretend that #democracy is just another name for majority's #autocracy  A pity it had to come to this. One would imagine Polish have a few chapters of history dealing with governments who have absolute power
From #diplomat to #solider to #scholar From #Poland to #America #JanKarski Karski presented his report...but without result, as most people could not comprehend the scale of extermination that he recounted #WIDA #DIplomaticDiary @PolandMFA @PolishEmbassyUS #Holocaust #NeverForget 
➡ The #EU's top #court on Wednesday ordered #Poland to pay a daily #fine of EUR 1 million for not suspending a contested disciplinary chamber for judges, adding to pressure on Warsaw over the rule of law. 
Macron’s silence on #RuleofLaw crisis did nothing passed unobserved during the last #EUCO  Some read it as ‘inevitable’ ahead  of the French Presidency (and required facilitator/mediator role), others as worrisome.  By now, it’s clear who got that right. #Poland 
As it has not suspended the application of its law relating to the areas of jurisdiction of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court, #Poland is ordered to pay the @EU_Commission a *daily* penalty payment in an amount of €1,000,000 …
