Mass protests in #Poland amid EU exit fears  #ruleoflaw 
The Permanent Representation of #Poland to the EU pointed to @GazpromEN and its market manipulations as one of the reasons for rising energy prices and appealed to the #EU for action. 
Hello #Gdansk! Looking forward to work again with @polska_filharmonia_baltycka and my great friend @maltesetenor! #poland #italy #malta #opera #concert #tenor #conductor #orchestra @ Hilton Gdańsk 
Yesterday, pro-EU rallies were held across #Poland. The protests came after the Constitutional Court ruled against the primacy of #EU law, raising fears of a “Polexit”. 
Although, as expected, #bbcnews very biased and selective in its reporting, it at least now acknowledges that EU law does indeed supercede national law and infringes on sovereignty.  #Poland #Polexit 
For those who still wonder whether Poles are still pro-Europeans.   Anyone who still doubts that EU action to preserve the Union’s common acquis could fuel anti-EU sentiment in #Poland?   Time to act is NOW.   #RuleOfLaw #article7 @CBeaune @RPFranceUE @fidh_en @fidh_eu

@snb19692 Be like #Poland out in their masses day after day after day. One day isn't enough because the Tories go into hiding that day acting like it's not happening. How could they ignore this 🔽 
On October 7, #Poland's Constitutional Court ruled that the country's legislation takes precedence over EU law. But thousands of Poles disagreed &amp; took to the streets: in Warsaw alone, ~100,000 people gathered for the rally, @tvn24 reports. People gathered in other 🇵🇱 cities too. 
The overall awareness of the #EU co-funded projects is increasing (41%), with the highest awareness being in #Poland 🇵🇱 (82%), #Slovakia 🇸🇰 (73%) &amp; #Czechia 🇨🇿 (70%), shows the latest #EURegionalBarometer   #CohesionPolicy   More ⬇️  
Good to see people standing up for their rights. Whether it works or not...   #BBCNews | Mass protests in #Poland amid #EU exit fears. #Polexit

Excellent piece on the state of affairs in #Hungary and #Poland   #Klubradio @mariusdrag @eldiarioes
@photoofthemond1 @Bart_Wielinski Yes. Absolutely. Please enlighten me to #Poland's real problem. Apathy is our biggest enemy. Just look at the mess the #UK is in.
@visegrad24 Discrediting a judicial system for irresponsible homosexuals should not be part of the EU's values ​​as far as I am concerned.  #Poland #eu #polen
 The Poles took to the streets of Warsaw supporting European Union, after a Polish Court recently challenged the supremacy of E.U #Polexit #Poland #EuropeanUnion #PolexitStop

The people of #Poland have spoken by their sheer numbers in the 100000 large rally. Enough with the BS, nation states are a thing of the past. Unify Europe ffs
