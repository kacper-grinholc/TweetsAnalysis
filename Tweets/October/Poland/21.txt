#Poland's rescuers find body of #Syria citizen in Buh river. #Belarus services pushed them into river, fellow migrant claims  #EU 
actually, the situation is superbly ironic. "Supporting" #Poland in #Seehofer sense is implementing border controls so refugees have to stay in Poland rather than moving on to #Germany. 1/3 
@DaveKeating The only and logical conclusion @MinPres makes about #Poland which also applies to others who are travelling on this road towards illiberalism. There can be no compromise within the EU on Democratic norms, the independency of the judiciary and freedom of the press.
#Poland strengthened its border with neighboring #Belarus by adding nearly 3,000 soldiers as the country recently reported record-high migration levels, prompting stepped-up security measures, the defense minister said on Tuesday. 
While she tried to dampen tension over the #Poland rule of law issue, #Merkel was keen to stress the seriousness of #Belarus's "state-backed human trafficking" - and the continued failure of the EU to come to any agreement on migrant settlement generally.

#EU #POLAND #HUNGARY #TURKEY  '...critics from the EU view as Turkey Hungary Poland backsliding on the issue of judicial independence, an EU principle. ...'
Here's an explainer for anyone who's interested in the conflict simmering on the border between #Poland and #Belarus:  
Ephemeral Maps: Republic of #Poland n 1920 (in French), from Excelsior (#Paris), February 1920 #newspaper #map #war #territory #borders #Mitteleurope #CentralEurope #easteurope #Germany #Lithuania #Russia (A larger version here:  
Dutch PM Mark Rutte was the most vocal about the #Poland situation upon entering #EUCO.  "It's difficult to see how a big new fund of money...could be made available to Poland when this is not settled," he said.  "We have to be tough, but the question is how do you get there". 
The Polish PM is being supported by Hungarian PM Viktor #Orban, who told reporters there is "a witch hunt in Europe against #Poland".  He said he agrees with Morawiecki that their EU accession treaties didn't establish primacy of EU law. Legal experts disagree. 
The #EUCO summit of EU prime ministers and presidents has just gotten underway here in Brussels.   There are many important issues to discuss, among them soaring #energy prices and a #migration crisis at the #Belarus border.  But the #RuleOfLaw row with #Poland may dominate. 
Today 🇵🇱PL and 🇱🇹LT HoMs to 🇵🇸 Palestine paid a visit to H.E. Minister R. Malki to commemorate the Mutual Pledge of the Two Nations adopted by the Kingdom of #Poland and the Grand Duchy of #Lithuania 230 years ago. United we are stronger! @MofaPPD @LTinRamallah @PLinLithuania

We're excited to introduce our Workthere #Poland team!  Looking for a flex #office? Get in touch with our team:  
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor #Orban rejected the primacy of European law over national law on Thursday, siding with #Poland as he arrived for a European Union summit. "The fact is very clear: The primacy of #EU law is not in the (EU) treaty at all," Orban said. via @reuters
Another Dutch male feminist lecturing #Poland. This is the same #EPP fraud that claims Frontex defends EU borders.🙈   @jeroen_lenaers , Rutte, Timmermans and all these arrogant, over-rated Dutch hacks need to realize their woke, multicult values do not sell in #Poland or #V4 
#Germany's Chancellor Angela #Merkel:   Rule of law is a core aspect of the European Union. At the same time, we have to find ways of coming back together, we must find a solution with #Poland.
Arrival and doorstep by @MinPres Prime Minister of the #Netherlands, at the #EuropeanCouncil #EUCO taking place on 21 October 2021, in Brussels. On #RuleofLaw in #Poland "We can continue working on #Article7, which is our way to deal with this issue."
🇵🇱 "We wouldn't have an abortion ban if we had the #RuleOfLaw" says @martalempart from @strajkkobiet on the illegitimate ruling of the Constitutional Court in #Poland.  #GAC 
. @MinPres 🇳🇱 "I see very difficult how a new big fund of money, out of #recovery fund, could be made available to #Poland if this issue is not settled". #RuleOfLaw #EUCO @eunewsit

Biggest problem (majority party) in EU 👉self-absorbed, selfie-obsessed charlatans of @EPPGroup. EU opportunists designed to keep authentic national conservatives from emerging to challenge EU federalists. As majority party, it surrendered EU borders &amp; failed Europe. #V4 #Poland  
Prime Minister of #Spain, Pedro Sanchez:  #Poland must accept the #EU Commission is the guardian of the treaty. The commission, the EU's executive, is bound to protect the rights of all citizens across the bloc of 27 nations, which are bound together by a common rule of law.
We are a few days away from marking one year since the near-total ban on abortion care in #Poland. Human rights defenders from Poland, Turkey &amp; Chile have a message for us 👇🏼  #DefendTheDefenders #Poland #LegalAbortion  #LegalnaAborcja 
. @MorawieckiM 🇵🇱 " #Poland does not see an issue and we function like any other EU state. We have also presented a plan of changing the judicial system. We do respect the superiority of EU Law over National law in areas where this really should be the case. #EUCO @eunewsit 
#EPP tries to lecture #Poland (little #Tusk groupies) about ‘values’ bt PiS defends its border/citizens; Germany sacrifices own citizens at altar of Multicult. Germany is cooked, identity gone. @EPPGroup majority party but failed EU/Germany. Keep woke EPP values out of #CEE #V4 
Angela #Merkel 🇩🇪 "We have to discuss the question how the MS envisage the EU. Is this the ever closer Union, or nationhood/ more national competencies? This will also be discussed in other MS. In fact, the #CoFoE is a good place to discuss this". #EUCO #Poland @eunewsit 
#Ireland's PM Michael Martin:  We have good relations with #Poland, but we are extremely disappointed. We believe the situation needs to be resolved in favor of the rule of law. The primacy of EU law &amp; the Court of Justice is critical for the protection of all #EU citizens.
Angela #Merkel 🇩🇪 #RuleOfLaw is a key part of the EU, but on the other hand we need to find possibilities to come together again, as a cascade of legal disputes before the ECJ is not the solution" #EUCO #Poland @eunewsit

#Germany, currently led by @EPPGroup fake right CDU/CSU), overwhelmed at border w #Poland.   Then Germany should build wall, reduce benefits &amp; deport illegals out of Europe. Under leadership of #EPP, Germany a problem for all &amp; magnet for aggressive males from alien cultures. #V4
