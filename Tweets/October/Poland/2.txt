#Poland says 11,500 people have tried to cross the #border illegally so far this year, including 6,000 in September, compared with about 100 for the whole of last year
Concerns over #Poland’s treatment of migrants stranded on its #border with #Belarus are mounting after Warsaw this week ignored domestic and international criticism to extend a state of #emergency and sought to portray them as dangerous deviants
#Poland has sent thousands of troops to the #border, built a razor-wire fence along part of its length, and on Thursday extended its state of #emergency, which bars journalists and aid workers from accessing the 3km-deep strip, by a further 60 days. 
Lest we forget... #OTD On October 2, 1944, #WarsawUprising 🇵🇱 ended. 63 days of fighting with the Nazi invader. The cost of the battle was the destruction of the city and the death of about 180,000 people. #WARSAWUPRISING #Poland

Based on past, German meddling into #Poland’s affairs will not go over well w-Poles. Germany lured illegals worldwide without input from others. If Merkel wants to help, can arrange to directly transfer illegals to Germany; better yet, return illegals back to countries of origin. 
#Poland record daily illegal attempts to cross border; 10,000 attempts August, 7,535 Sept. 50 illegals posed potential security threat to country since they are involved in terrorist organizations/criminal gangs. Despite EU whining, Poland must pushback or it will be flooded. #V4
