#BBC in support of human trafficking by #Lukashenka  regime: New project aims to help migrants crossing border illegally into #Poland 
This country!!  ...#Poland  Just took the bins out,  and there are fireworks going off like mad in the north of the village,  god knows why  ...it just happens.

This is not like Brexit. It's about the ability of the ruling party to go on breaking the rule of law inside #Poland - sumup by @anneapplebaum 
I DIDN’T even know #Poland exported wood floors. 
How little integrity must you have, how poor must your moral character be, to try to sneak into someone's country, knowing the people don't want you there? #Poland

🇵🇱 An protest is being held in Warsaw demanding that the Polish authorities provide asylum to migrants blocked at the border.  Participants came out with slogans "Shame" and "No torture at the border". #Poland #Warsaw

This is horrific. Iraqi migrants at the border between #Belarus and #Poland are trying to break the fence to enter Poland. Dictator #Lukashenko keeps sending the migrants to clash with the polish border control, escalating the conflict, but only punishing Belarussians and Iraqis 
@CaroRackete @abolishfrontex "Under the motto "Stop torture at the border", thousands of people demonstrated in #Poland against the #pushbacks of migrants at the border with #Belarus. Parliament approved pushbacks, and a fortified border system is also planned.": 
Could Poland leave the EU?  Talk of #Poland leaving EU in manner similar to Brexit is misguided. Polish voters will not vote to leave (esp with UK example before them!). Use of #Article7 will fail; support of Hungary for Poland will prevent unanimity vote.
The #Strava leaderboards are spreading! Our first activity has been registered in Małomice, Lubusz, #Poland. Welcome aboard! 
@pj_castillo_  #Polexit is highly unlikely - certainly not similar to Brexit. #Poland wishes to stay - and support from #Hungary will prevent #Article7 eviction. There is no precedent for a member state undermining  EU from inside, without leaving. "Events" will occur!
