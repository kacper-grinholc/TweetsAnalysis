Ryszard Witkowski was a #WW2 resistance soldier in #Poland who, between fighting Nazi Germany and sheltering Jews from the Holocaust, documented the war via photography. This week he donated his camera to @WarsawRising44. Read about him @the_1st_news:

More than 20.000 highly qualified #IT specialists left #Belarus last year.Most of the programmers go to #Lithuania, #Poland and #Ukraine.  IT-specialists were among the first who defend the rights and freedoms of #Belarusians. The #dictator could not forgive them. 
The specter of ”Polexit” from the #EU rises. As with the impetus for #Brexit, #Poland desires the ability to nullify by noncompliance certain EU laws. Ethnic predilections and interests raise animosities among EU members. The #Antichrist disintegrates. 
Hello, #Sochaczew, #Poland. Thanks for listening to my tunes.
@RobertMertens16 @OliviaDurandIRL @jonhenley @guardian So the guy that was smuggling people as a profession for 10 years, is sitting in #Belarus forest trying to get to #Germany and that's #Poland problem? People do your research! Polish winter is not friendly, and study our mushrooms &amp; forest fruit.
I visited 2 ships. The 1st had an all-American crew. The 2nd had crew from #Italy, #Ukraine, #Poland, #Greece, &amp; #Romania. Several of them came into the office to get their Christmas caps. 2 of the security officers (the guys who protect the ship from piracy) wanted to go ashore.

#BorisJohnson &amp; @pritipatel could LEARN A LOT! from #Poland Right NOW!! 👏👏👏 👁️👀👁️ 
🧵 #Poland, one of Europe’s most pro-EU countries, is now haunted by a fear of an exit from the club. @donaldtusk return to the national stage has only sharpened the dividing line that will now be focused on the potential #Polexit (1/7)
My interview for @E15news - implementation of the rule of law mechanism against #Poland not imminent, #Polexit highly unlikely in spite of the conservative opposition against some #EU policies. Poles appreciate the membership in the Union too much for this to happen. 
Let's go back to the moment when Robert #Lewandowski made his debut for Poland...   ...as a right-back🤯  #BayernMunich #Poland @LaczyNasPilka 
What has got #Poland through the pandemic relatively unscathed is a combination of good fortune, making GDP a priority over health &amp; restrictions centred more on personal freedoms than economic freedoms, @pwlbukowski &amp; @wpaczos @CEP_LSE @notesfrompoland  
@ByrneBarry Good for Poland. I wish our Govt were as determined and strong v. The damn EU. #Poland 👍🏻
Read our colleague's @LydsG piece about the plight of #Afghans stuck at the Polish-Belarus border.  Rather than pushing people seeking asylum back #Poland’s government should allow them to submit claims in Poland &amp; ensure they receive food &amp; medical care.   
So, #Poland is a bitch just because it doesn't want to give in to #Belarusian regime blackmailing it?

Told you. New fence is coming within 2 years IMHO, where once was the Iron Curtain. EU is Socialism on steroids and while Western Europe is sleeping, Eastern Europe sees what is really happening. They have seen this before. #Hungary #Slovenia #Poland #EU 
The #RuleOfLaw #conditionality mechanism has been unused by the @EU_Commission for 2⃣8⃣7⃣ days  - but the authoritarians in #Poland &amp; #Hungary didn't pause. @EP_Legal gives the EC time to act until 2/11 before starting a legal action at @EUCourtPress ⚖️⌛️

Bravo mr. #JanezJansa @JanezJansa prime Minister of Slovenia. You are completely right in what you said about #SophieintVeld #D66 mr. #MarkRutte and mr. #GeorgeSoros @GeorgeSoros. We admire you, as we admire #Poland and #Hungary!
#Poland's "parliament has passed a law allowing border guards to immediately expel #migrants who cross the border illegally. Guards will also be given power to refuse applications for international #asylum, without examination". Legalizing #pushbacks❗  
Warsaw's continuous violations of EU law could potentially lead to a "legal Polexit" and turn #Poland into a second-class Member State, says our @J_Jaraczewski in his latest op-ed for @euronews.  Read it here 👇  #RuleOfLaw #EU @reconstitutEU 
Happy that we will be visiting #Poland next week. 
“How does the left-liberal elite want to protect #European values if they can only do so by breaching the very same values and treaty rules?” Read my Op-ed on #Poland below👇🏻  
The Constitutional Court of Poland ruled that some basic EU treaty articles are incompatible with the national Polish constitution. What does this entail for the principle of primacy of EU law?  Some thoughts on Poland’s top court ruling: 📎  #EU #Poland

This made my day. @TheEconomist likened #Poland in the #EU to Rorschach from @watchmen. Remember the scene? "None of you seem to understand. I'm not locked in here with you. You're locked in here with *ME*. I hope "Dirty Remain" will not become #.
