@Penyrheolgerrig @BBCNews #Poland certainly has no wish to leave the #EU. It has opened up markets for goods and service - they know they would be mad - absolutely insane (as would any country) - to aim to leave the EU and screw up their economy.
in love with warsaw &lt;3 #Poland #Warsaw 
The German and French foreign ministers have issued a joint statement saying that #Poland has both a moral and legal obligation to respect the common rules of the European Union, which is joined in 2004.

As fa as I’m concerned #Poland and other Countries that don’t deserve must be banned by #EU. We’ve already been waiting too long getting rid of #UK. #Hungary is the next one.
@CawthornforNC #nordstream2 After all, Poles already talked about it 7 years ago, Donald 4 years ago, and Joe fell asleep last year #CentralEurope #Poland #german #russia and now #Incredible
@PeterStefanovi2 @Femi_Sorry @campbellclaret I thought you were describing #Poland - a country run by a #Catholic Government that would gaol #Christ for his love of all people. Where as the poles sanctioned the death of children on their border! However, the #UK is very similar in its outlook.
Another pathetic populist and eurosceptic is out. Good riddance. Wishing the same to #Poland’s #PiS and #Hungary’s #Orban.  #Babis #Czech elections

If #Poland does do #Polexit will we sign a mutual assistance treaty? I mean there is a precedent for this, although I can’t for the life of me remember why it lapsed from the earlier one. Anyone got any ideas? Teaming up with Poland should be OK shouldn’t it? What could go wrong?

Crazy to think this Fabianski’s final ever appearance for #Poland.
As #Poland remains legally bound by its commitments and by 100% EU Treaties it has democratically ratified, will it honour #Article20 of #TFEU - and extend #FoM (Freedom of Movement) to all UK nationals born before 1st February 2020 who had been granted citizenship of EU by then?

The European Court of Justice has found that #Poland’s Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court acted undemocratically by appointing judges who are not sufficiently neutral. George Xenophontos from @CardiffLaw writes:

75 percent of Poles favor membership in the EU. #Poland wants to change the EU if it can, not leave it. Poland is an EU member State and it remains legally bound by its commitments and EU Treaties it has  ratified. This is the legal situation now.
A useful and simple explanation of the concept of #supremacy of #EUlaw and the different challenges it has faced over the years, with this week's ruling of the 🇵🇱 Constitutional Tribunal certainly being the biggest challenge to date.   #Poland

It's plain &amp; simple: there is a written treaty. Those who signed must fulfill their obligations under that treaty. #Orbán's government resolution citing national sovereignty clearly serves communication purposes. Definitely music for nationalist ears in both #Poland &amp; #Hungary.
Time to remind the government of #Poland and Viktor #Orbán in #Hungary for the treaties of the #EuropeanUnion. Here are some relevant articles of the Treaty of Lisbon, for instance.  
@ConnyKis The #EU can not print and pump #Euros forever to sponsor #Greece #Italy etc. #Poland is an uprising country while West Europe became a big inflated bubble about to explode. #Polexit is not a bad idea, #NATO needs #Poland, the country has no terrorism, investors love #Poland.

An alarming decision!  #Poland’s constitutional court set up a head-on collision with the EU by ruling that the country’s Constitution trumps some laws set by the bloc, a decision that threatens to dissolve the glue that holds the EU's 27 members together

As always, we cannot throw out the baby with the bathwater. In #Poland, there are many people who share european values and know the differences between stay in or stay out of the European Union.  #Polexit #Polska #Polonia #eu #ue #UnionOfPeople #UnioneEuropea #EuropeanUnion
Prof.Jakab says there are three reasons for backslidingon #RuleofLaw in #Hungary &amp; #Poland:(i) Easy access to EUfunding(ii)brain drain of the liberal minded (iii)lack of EU mechanism over ensuring that MSs comply with EU values post-accession@reconnectEU @RevDem2020 @CEUDemInst
In #Poland a criminal investigation was initiated against parents of #children that painted pictures on the street in favor of #immigration and saying 'no one is illegal'.

Morning frost in #Poland. Winter is lurking. 
Dear Polish people, don't do it. Poland is stronger in the EU.  Five years on from Brexit, and the UK is in a dire state. Polarisation, poverty, food shortages, driver shortages, etc., etc.  #Polexit #Poland
After Brexit comes Pexit? Poland ‘takes back control’ by placing national law first   Polexit fears are stoked by a court ruling that decisions by the EU’s highest court are incompatible with #Poland’s constitution --&gt;    #Polexit #Pexit #Poland #Brexit

People hiding in the bushes, on the Polish-Belarusian border, the situation is getting worse.  #Belarus #poland 
Once again, Brexiteers proven correct about the way the EU views itself in relation to its member states. Always perfectly illustrated by the high-handed way it treats weaker members. Threats normally. #Hungary #Poland #Ireland
#poland  stokes fears of leaving EU in 'Polexit' 
Not that I can eat any, the vegetarian selection in my cousin's butchers is limited, but look #Poland proper pies, and proper big sausage rolls...  and what's more pickled onions in malt vinegar!  #pies #pickledonions #properpies 
This show-down between #Poland and the #EU has been a long time coming. Poland either asserts the primacy of their national constitution or it capitulates to the EU and confirms its supremacy. #Polexit  #Brexit
@XrPtruth @CNN It's #Poland who breaks conditions. #EU member states will help out every other member state for a long as their justice system is fair and within the EU's values. Poland agreed with that themselves. In return they'd get many privileges and billions 💰 support for development.
The #EU philosophy as with many of the eastern states seems to be "Keeping Poland's economy on a low flame will keep #Poland under the EU control."  The Polish government and courts seem to disagree and they have that prerogative; the EU exists only by sovereign state mandates.
@BBCNews If Poland does leave the EU then I wonder how long it would take for Boris Johnson to plead with them for a trade deal? I wonder if 'free movement' will be well &amp; truly back on the table...? #BrexitShambles  #Poland🇵🇱
