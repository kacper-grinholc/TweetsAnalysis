The problem isn't #Poland being "inhuman" with refugees, because as hard as it seems, you can't give in to obvious blackmail.    The problem is Europe being weak (over-prudent) against #Lukashenko. With some strong reaction, Lukashenko would be in exile in Russia by now. 
We have a humanitarian obligation to help people in need, and there‚Äôs no sane argument against it. That‚Äôs it. Refugees welcome ‚Äî always.  #Poland 
Do most citizens of #Poland truly want to remain in the #EU, or invoke #POLEXIT‚ùì  As per opinion polls, usually having sample sizes of only several hundred to about a thousand+ participants, the answer is "remain". How accurate is this‚ùì A referendum might be worth considering.

@VeraJourova you have a difficult situation to deal with in #Poland.  Please do not make the mistake of doing nothing.  The European Commission decided not to 'interfere' in the Brexit Referendum ; yet the people in the UK desperately needed information on what the EU does.

and still it grows. and still people can't be arsed to wear masks or take any precautions  more often than not I'm the only person wearing a mask in small shops, staff no longer bother, in larger shops it's about 30% wearing masks even though it's obligatory... #Poland #Polska

Over 60 years ago, #Poland became the first country after #Sweden, with which @IKEA tied its future. The key to success lies in the #entrepreneurial spirit of Poles &amp; Scandinavian simplicity and #innovation.     #cooperation #trust #partnership 
#Poland's Sejm approved the President's ordinance prolonging by 60 days the state of emergency in areas close to the country‚Äôs border with #Belarus. 
üáµüá± #Poland needs to step up its efforts to bring more women into positions of power in #Peace &amp; #Security! E.g. in the past 2 decades, the country never has had a female #DefenseMinister, and just one female #ForeignMinister. Peace needs women. More &amp; fast. #SHEcurity #FactFriday

Governments of #Poland &amp; #Hungary are the ones depriving their people from the EU Resilience &amp; Recovery Funds.  @EU_Commission should be clear: EU benefits come with obligation to respect rule of law.

#Poland and the #CzechRepublic have not reached agreement regarding the disputed #Turow open-cast lignite #mine. 
Here's a contrary view. There's a big danger to democracy when outside forces like the #EU use money to dictate the policies of an elected government in #Poland. As James II demonstrated when he ruled without Parliament on the basis of French subsidies.

The #EU is discussing signing off on #Hungary &amp; #Poland‚Äôs recovery proposals, which would free up billions of euros in #stimulus. But the EU may first activate a #ruleoflaw mechanism. 
#HappyFriday! A memory from 1 year ago, our #ISayEurope interview with @donaldtuskEPP, who said, "I am quite sure that if the democratic opposition in #Poland were able to unite before the next parliamentary election, they would have a chance to win."  @EPP
@EU_Commission is heating up confrontation against #Poland and #Hungary on #EU funds and planning to use the new #RuleOfLaw mechanism as soon as the @EUCourtPress has decided on the the mechanisms constitutionality in October üëáüèº#eupol #dkmedier #dkpol
