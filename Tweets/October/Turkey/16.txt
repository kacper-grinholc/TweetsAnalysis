As #Turkey prepares to eradicate the #PKK/#YPG/#SDF presence in Northern #Syria- the propaganda machine is in full swing: we will soon see Tweets claiming that Turkey is using chemical weapons, killing innocent civilians etc in Syria
News.  Saddam Hussein used chemicals against the Kurds.  Is that another line #Erdogan crosses and where he wants to take #Turkey? 
Why does the West not want #Turkey to intervene in #Syria? Why is the West supporting a #PKK/#YPG State in Syria?  Uncle Sam does not want Turkey to become neighbour's with Israel. The aim is to create buffer States around the State of Israel controlled by Washington.
