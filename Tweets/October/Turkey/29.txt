At the same time, #Turkey is engaged in fighting the SAA through both word and deed in #Idlib and northern #Syria, while the #HTS stays virtually idle. Thus, Ankara damages the reputation of the HTS, slowly approaching its goal of amalgamating Al-#Julani group. 4/4
The main beneficiary of this situation in #Idlib is #Turkey. Ankara has long been trying to force the #HTS to play by its rules and join the #SNA. The protests like in #Atarib might be key in exerting more pressure on the HTS and make it obey. 3/4
