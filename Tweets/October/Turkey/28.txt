#Turkey should give serious thought to Chinese 5th Gen Fighter Jets. It would also avoid CAATSA sactions which target Russia. This would provoke Congress to come up with new pieces of legislation trying to prevent the deal. This in turn would expose the real intention of the US.

At first sight, you would confuse them with Turkish soldiers but they are not. They are 🇹🇷s own worthless pawns.  This is what #Turkey does in #Syria &amp; #Libya. Recruit the poorest &amp; desperate citizens of the countries they invade and turn them into their own disposable soldiers.
