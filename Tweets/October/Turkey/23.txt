#TURKEY President #Erdogan said Saturday he had ordered the foreign ministry to banish 10 ambassadors - #Canada, #Denmark, #France, #Germany, the #Netherlands, #Norway, #Sweden, #Finland, #NewZealand &amp; #USA - for calling for the release of philanthropist Osman Kavala 
Yikes, more troubling behavior from Erdogan's Turkey.  #Turkey #Erdogan #Türkiye #ForeignAffairs #ForeignPolicy #UN #NATO #Russia #Military 
I hope we look back on this day as the dawn of a new era in #Turkey.
#TURKEY’s President Erdogan has moved to expel the ambassadors of 10 Western countries who appealed for the release of jailed civil society leader, #OsmanKavala. If the expulsions are carried out, it would open the deepest rift with the West in Erdogan’s 19 years in power.

Why? They supported the Euro Court of Human Rights call for #OsmanKavala's release (issued 2 years ago). Court said there was no reasonable suspicion that Kavala  had committed an offence &amp; that his detention had been intended to silence him. #Turkey 
If they succeed, #Turkey will be at a better place but #Putin won’t allow it.

"#Erdogan's [bid to resolve issues through cooperation] has been consistently ignored by the EU for years. So the question is not whether #Turkey wants to talk. Rather the question [has always been] whether the EU wants to cooperate or not" 
.@Lambsdorff: “The possible expulsion of 10 ambassadors, including the representatives of #Germany and many of #Turkey’s #NATO allies, would be unwise, undiplomatic and would weaken the cohesion of the alliance.”

" #EU President David Sassoli says #Turkey’s expulsion of the ambassadors of the US and nine other Western countries for demanding the release of philanthropist Osman Kavala is a sign of an “authoritarian drift.”   " 
Bravo #Turkey. There should be no way for their interference, as the rest of the world don't interfere in theirs. There is no less sovereign nation! 
Week-in-Review: What has potentially alarmed #Egypt further, beyond the threat of reduced water flow, has been the expansion of #Turkey’s ties with #Ethiopia 
@EP_President #JulianAssange was not involved in coups in UK or Congress riots but he is held prisoner and murder attempt was conspired on his life, EU Parliament spoke nothing on that matter!!  #Catalonia leaders are jailed in 🇪🇸 but they are not #Kavala and #Turkey is not Spain u hypocrite
Well that was needed. Half term refresh! #turkey #Libertyfabayhotel
