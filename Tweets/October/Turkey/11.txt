- Ten years ago, it was 1.8 #TurkishLira (TRY) to the USD - Today, it's 9.0 lira  That's a quite precise loss of 4/5s of #Turkey's currency in a decade.  Bravo, @RTErdogan &amp; your Canute-like war on interest rates. See you next when it's 10 to the dollar.

GOAL UPDATE: #Latvia 1:0 #Turkey 70' Demiral
The balances in #Syria have become very sensitive and complex, and any step by any party, if not calculated, may lead to an unwanted collision. Therefore, any Turkish move on the ground will be through a deal, otherwise military action is excluded.6/6 #Turkey #Russia #USA 
Turkey smoke dry run.  #fyp #goodeats #Smoker #louisianagrills #meaterplus #goya #chicfila #turkey @ Lakeshore, Houston 
#Turkey wants voice of Non-Aligned Movement to become stronger: FM  
The third option is for #Turkey not to move militarily, but rather to exploit the incident to put pressure on #Washington in the file of the Kurds of #Syria in order to obtain breakthroughs in other files, the most important of which are the S-400 and the F-16 file.5/6

What will happen if #Iran crosses the border with #Azerbaijan? Is there a ‘secret deal’ in the making? Iran does not fear #Israel’s wrath but #Turkey's. This time it’s serious!  By İbrahim Karagül @ibrahimkaragul   #geopolitics

This operation more likely will be coordinated with #Moscow in order to push the Kurdish militias in eastern #Syria to get closer to the #Assad regime and #Russia, as they are able to protect them from #Turkey.3/6 
@srdjancvijic @fbieber @NAM60Belgrade @CyprusMFA To be noted: #Cyprus is not a member of #NAM since it joined the #EU in 2004. Another possible reason why CY is not represented at Ministerial level.  So 1 #NATO member (#Turkey) &amp; 1 EU member (CY) are at @NAM60Belgrade. And they don't even like each other! Any others?
The first option, #Turkey may move towards exploiting what happened to carry out a media attack on the #YPG militia preparing for a military operation in another area less sensitive to #Russia (Ein al-Arab - Kobane city for example).2/6 
Based on the complications and the Turkish officials high tone statements, the main question will be what are #Turkey's options in responding to what happened in southern Mari'? 1/6 #Russia #USA #Syria #Biden #Erdogan #Putin #Iran  
Happy thanksgiving everyone! Here's yesterday's turkey and all the fixins 😍 . . #thanksgiving #turkey #roastturkey #mashedpotatoes #maplecarrots #beets #greenbeans #stuffing #family @ Abbotsford, British Columbia 
#Erdoğan says recent deadly attacks by the #YPG (PKK) on #Turkey's forces in northern #Syria have become intolerable. He vows a military operation will soon be launched to eliminate these terrorist threats. 
Therefore, #Moscow’s withdrawal from Tal Rifat is not an easy matter, and #Ankara knows this well. If #Turkey was ready to confront #Russia militarily in #Syria, #Assad would not have been able to advance militarily in the northern countryside of #Hama two years ago.3/3 
We are so thankful to work with and support so many amazing farmers and vendors.   Hope everyone has a restful and relaxing long weekend! Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!  #thanksgiving #thankful #fall #family #turkey #food #blessed #thanksgivingdinner #happythanksgiving #grateful 
Tal Rifaat area has its strategic importance due to its proximity to the city of #Aleppo and its location on the commercially important Aleppo-Kilis road, so any retreat from #Moscow may appear as a military defeat in front of #Ankara.2/3 #Turkey #Syria #Russia #USA 
One of these reasons is that #Russia wants to present itself to the Kurds in eastern #Syria that it is able to protect them from #Turkey, unlike America, which pulled back in front of Ankara in Operation Peace Spring.1/3 #YPG #USA #Biden #Erdogan #Putin
