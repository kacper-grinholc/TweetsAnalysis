The equivalent of 60% of #Russia’s GDP is held offshore — an incredible indictment of that country’s kleptocracy under #Putin, which enriches oligarchic elites and stashes stolen public wealth abroad. #PandoraPapers

Rakhahari Chatterji – Now that the “#WaronTerror” has concluded, India needs to define its role in the South Asian Region and attempt to engage with all possible partners, including #China and #Russia. 
#Russia is a strong advocate of #Iran's full membership of the SCO. #China should be fully onboard with this as well. Especially after the two (🇨🇳🇮🇷) signed a $400 bn economic deal.  Both 🇷🇺🇨🇳 will get a strong player in their bloc, that is oil rich &amp; has excellent bilateral...

The latest iteration of the seemingly eternal between those who claim #Russia is #gay and their opponents who refuse to accept this is true. As fought on #Prague’s Kodanska street since 2012 … every few months it is written again … and crossed through and written again … and 
@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @JoeBiden @MailOnline He also gave #Russia the list of infrastructure not to cyber attack. #FJoeBiden
@vincenzobarri71 @katlinegrey @Rogozin @NASASpaceflight It is not in Russia.  #Russia  cannot even launch their rockets to the #ISS  from Russian soil anymore!  How sad!

While visiting Paris today at a press availability with @OECD's secretary general, @SecBlinken spoke more in depth about his call with #Russia's foreign minister while #Iran's foreign minister was in Moscow. He noted the runway is "getting shorter and shorter" to revive JCPOA. 
.@ReufBajrovic: “#Russia-trained mercenaries in #Bosnia and #Montenegro are an integral part of the Serbian military strategy for the region. It is a carbon copy of #Putin’s pre-invasion actions in #Georgia and #Ukraine.” 
#NATO said on Wednesday it had stripped eight members of the #Russia'n mission to the Alliance of their accreditation, calling them "undeclared Russian intelligence officers," meaning spies. 
The government forces is besieging Jassem town in the countryside of #Daraa governorate, southern #Syria, despite the presence of a Russian-brokered settlement agreement with the notables. #Russia    
Guess AT&amp;T must be doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin #BlueAnon #Conspiracy #Russia 
IMHO, it would be better for Russia to terminate engaging with the #EU/#NATO on multilateral forums &amp; adopt the bilateral approach instead. The "bloc mentality" of EU/NATO will always stop their member states (collectively) to ever reconcile with #Russia.
Gas prices fluctuated wildly on Wednesday.  #NatGas #NaturalGas #Russia #Gazprom 
UK gas prices fall from record high after Russia steps in #Takingbackcontrol  ? Moving to a greater dependency on #Russia .
