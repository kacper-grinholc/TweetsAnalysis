The balances in #Syria have become very sensitive and complex, and any step by any party, if not calculated, may lead to an unwanted collision. Therefore, any Turkish move on the ground will be through a deal, otherwise military action is excluded.6/6 #Turkey #Russia #USA

This operation more likely will be coordinated with #Moscow in order to push the Kurdish militias in eastern #Syria to get closer to the #Assad regime and #Russia, as they are able to protect them from #Turkey.3/6 
The first option, #Turkey may move towards exploiting what happened to carry out a media attack on the #YPG militia preparing for a military operation in another area less sensitive to #Russia (Ein al-Arab - Kobane city for example).2/6

Based on the complications and the Turkish officials high tone statements, the main question will be what are #Turkey's options in responding to what happened in southern Mari'? 1/6 #Russia #USA #Syria #Biden #Erdogan #Putin #Iran  
Therefore, #Moscow’s withdrawal from Tal Rifat is not an easy matter, and #Ankara knows this well. If #Turkey was ready to confront #Russia militarily in #Syria, #Assad would not have been able to advance militarily in the northern countryside of #Hama two years ago.3/3 
8. China might intensify its overtures towards India to undermine US alliance-building. New Delhi’s non-aligned status and membership of the BRICS bloc – comprising #Brazil, #Russia, #India, #China and South Africa – and #SCO could make it a weak point in US alliance network.
#Russia seems to be aware that #Sisi’s strategy is to use their relationship to gain the attention of the US and, in turn, is using it for its own purposes.
.@MarietjeSchaake | "The fear of getting in the way of digital innovation has paralyzed Washington. As a result, our tech companies are more concerned about what is legal and illegal in #Russia and #China than what the U.S. requires." (@FinancialTimes) 
Tal Rifaat area has its strategic importance due to its proximity to the city of #Aleppo and its location on the commercially important Aleppo-Kilis road, so any retreat from #Moscow may appear as a military defeat in front of #Ankara.2/3 #Turkey #Syria #Russia #USA 
One of these reasons is that #Russia wants to present itself to the Kurds in eastern #Syria that it is able to protect them from #Turkey, unlike America, which pulled back in front of Ankara in Operation Peace Spring.1/3 #YPG #USA #Biden #Erdogan #Putin

#NordStream2 has made more Ukrainian territory ripe for deeper Russian military invasion and occupation.  We should not be surprised if an “accident” occurs in #Ukraine’s gas pipeline system soon. And this will mark a very dangerous new phase of #Russia’s war of aggression. 
As for the possibility of #Turkey moving militarily in the Tal Rifat area, the step is very complicated because #Moscow will be in the frontline this time, and will not be positive about Turkey's progress at the expense of its influence there for several reasons.7/7 #Russia #YPG
