After the announcement that #Tajikistan would not recognize the #Taliban government until they include ethnic Tajiks in the gov, #Russia is urging the improvements in Tajikistan-Afghan relations to avoid potential security crisis on the border.  
Instead of advancing, US &amp; UK are blocking better protection of HRS and climate change, by opposing recognition of #HealthyEnvironmentForAll at #HRC48   And #Brazil #Russia joining also in the Hall of Shame States still can lead with good example and get into their senses
