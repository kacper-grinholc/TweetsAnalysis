#Russia will invite representatives of the #Taliban to international talks on #Afghanistan that it plans to host in Moscow on October 20, President Vladimir Putin’s special representative on Afghanistan said.
After briefly flirting with #Russia over the possibility of buying Su-35 fighter jets, #Turkey opts for the tried and tested F-16s instead. Interesting that this comes following Erdogan's visit to #Russia and today's phone call with Putin, where he wished him happy birthday.
