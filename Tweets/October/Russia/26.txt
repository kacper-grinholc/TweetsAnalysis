#Ukraine used the #Turkish flagship drone Bayraktar against Russian allied forces. Thankfully, the drone was garbage and it missed. All 3 soldiers are alive.   Now #Russia is going to teach them a lesson.

They know Ethiopia was up against a higher power than the ragtags of #TPLF. I wish we had a similar ally like #China or #Russia in similar kind
