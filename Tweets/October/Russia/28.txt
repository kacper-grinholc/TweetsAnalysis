@alinazary Draw your own conclusions. If I were you, I would seek rapprochement with Russia. But to do this, #NRF must develop and become powerful enough for countries such as #Russia, #Iran and #China to abandon cooperation with the #Taliban and start cooperating with #NRF. 5

#Russia is expanding its military interventions in sub-Saharan &amp; Central #Africa, seeking to access #Diamond &amp; #GOLD mines &amp; challenge geopolitical opponents. The #Libya military campaign served as a springboard to other African countries, including #Mali. 
@alinazary To be honest, I don't see anything good in the fact that #NRF is getting closer to the #USA: 1) The USA sold you to the #Taliban. 2) In the eyes of #Russia, you look like pro-American forces. 3) Russia will not let the United States into this region by any means. 1/4
@visegrad24 It’s the right way to go for #Poland. Strong military is the way. #Russia will be your friend, but not #Brussels.
