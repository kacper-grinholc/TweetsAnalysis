@SenToomey If you’re making over ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS per year, pay taxes like the rest of us.  What’s the problem here Pat ?  Or is this a talking point to avoid the fact that you’re blocking aid to #ukraine #ToomeyLies #VoteFetterman @JohnFetterman
Peace ☮️ talks between #RussiaUkraineWar are progressing. No #NATO membership for #Ukraine 🇺🇦 and #Russia would limit its operations near Ukraine. Vladimir Putin @KremlinRussia_E agreed to meet @ZelenskyyUa #GivePeaceaChance

@mrpeabody @h7n33n A peace deal leaving #Putin in charge of #Russia won't last past dry ink. #Ukraine must act in its own interest for survival. Putin is buying time as this is his war against democratic ideals. The West should not use innocent Ukrainians as a buffer, while preparing to fight back.

@MarkHertling @fpleitgenCNN Russians have already begun to attack their own ammunition depot in the city of #Belgorod. Probably easier than being successful in #Ukraine.
It would have been much better if they'd started 8 years ago when Putin first invaded #Ukraine and seized Crimea. I'm just saying.  04

Another nazi torture camp in Ukraine that the MSM won't touch with a 50 foot pole.    #ukraine #doublestandards 
@Artur10388377 Sport, but its important to keep informed about the war in #Ukraine and its wider impact so we cover some of the details in relation to the #Russian invasion.
"On the table after all is #Crimea, not historically part of the #Ukraine, and therefore full of Russians." #Russia @ClarkeMicah @georgegalloway 
As #foreignfighters pour into #Ukraine to assist it, questions are raised about what would become of these volunteers as the definition of “foreign fighters” gets muddy. @maya206 writes.

#Russia have made the President of #Ukraine into a symbol of resistance against aggression. They will have to live with this in the future and i think they already regret it. He is a master of communication.
#Ukraine has to stop offering "options".  This is a Russian farce. 
Largest ongoing #refugee crises in the world, accumulated  2022:   #Syria: 6.7 million  #Venezuela: 6.1 million  #Ukraine: 3.9 million   In Syria there has been an armed conflict for more than a decade.  Ukraine is being invaded.  In #Venezuela: the legacy of #Chavismo
