On top of all the other horrible things, this is beyond disgusting. Lowest of lows. #Ukraine #russia #rape 
Putin should not be in power. #Russia
Among the 190-plus #UN member states, more than 140 countries did not follow suit to #sanction #Russia. This fact shows that the overwhelming majority of countries are handling issues related to sanctions in a prudent and responsible manner.
Get ready boys, SMQ's visit to #China &amp; #Russia is going to bring alot.  Lightning gotta be striking very soon  #کپتان_کے_سپاہی #یہ_بازی_خان_ہی_جیتے_گا #BehindYouSkipper

And yet Americans 🇺🇸 have the antics of a child going through the terrible twos at the very idea of a foreign country (only #Russia🇷🇺 in this case. #ApartheidIsrael🇮🇱 meddling is just fine) meddling in their elections! 
@Zpolishman Absolutely not. #Putin's war is the grossest example of ethnic cleansing since WW2. @JoeBiden reacted precisely how he should. #PoisonerPutin shouldn't be in charge of anybody or anywhere. So, it's over to you #Russia. Joe called it right.
Freight traffic ban will pinch in both countries.  #Ukraine #NATO #Russia #EU #Putin #Finland #Suomi 
Imagine what #europe would be like had #nato admitted #russia as a member when #VladimirPutin asked to join years ago. I point this out because USA is complicit in #UkraineRussiaWar. This was way before Bucharest conference in 2008.
The man behind #Russian poisonings is always #Putin.  #VladimirPutin needs to spend lifetimes behind bars for his war crimes and crimes to humanity.  Even #Oligarchs aren’t immune from him. Sociopaths don’t have a conscience.   #Russia should rise up.  Millions vs 1 piece of crap

@antiputler_news If it's right, #Russia would be preparing for another wave. It's a matter of time. I hope #Ukraine will be ready and could resist a second wave.  Don't expect #Russia make the same mistakes. #UkraineUnderAttaсk #UkraineRussiaWar #UkraineRussianWar
