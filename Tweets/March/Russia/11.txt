#Russia's war in #Ukraine put new stress on supply chains, which benefits shipping companies.
It's not in #Israel's interests to prop up #Putin at this time. In fact, #Israel has a good opportunity to work with #Turkey &amp; capitalize on #Russia's current weakness in #Syria. #Erdogan is not trustworthy, but minimizing #Russia's presence in #Syria is in his interests.

Public pressure forced the extremely corrupt Deutsche Bank to distance themselves from their core business, being a laundromat for corrupt #Russia money. Sanctions and public pressure are effective, even against awful companies like Deutsche Bank! #Ukraine

From a strategic comms perspective, I think the üá∫üá≤ may have been mistaken in its approach to #Russia #biolabs spin. All #US did was fuel the discussion on Bio labs and lose control over the narrative. What say you #DigitalDiplomacy tweeps‚ÅâÔ∏è 
The true is that US/EU or shortly the West doesn't give a shit about #Ukraine ukrainian sovereignty or Ukrainian people. All thay care is to damage #Russia and deal attrition to its hardware using ukrainian blood. 85% of westerner even can't show where Ukraine is on map.
