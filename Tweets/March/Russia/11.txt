@Arslon_Xudosi #Ukraine - the 2nd #Russia's tank graveyard after Afghanistan.
#russia is a cross between Croydon and medieval Viking mythology
Diplomat Sergey Lavrov #negotiation approach in Antalya: advocating listener role - getting counterpart mentally drained; declaring not being authorized to take decisions - usually meaning exactly the opposite; exploiting #Russia #propaganda as leverage. 
VERY interesting Thread about #Russia  TV show.  #SanctionRussiaNow #sanctions #Ukraine #RussiaUkraineWar #RussianUkrainianWar #RussianInvasion #RussiaInvadedUkraine 
I am done with EuroWoke A disgrace for humanity   #Russia is planning to use biological weapons in the #Ukraine and target their own civilians as well?  SURE❗️  And on for hand #Russia give ‘a presentation’ during a NATO security meeting?  SURE❗️  YOU’RE OBLIGED TO INVESTIGATE!! 
Yes, but. #Russia's air power can be mitigated other ways, like with thousands of #Stingers       ///       #Ukraine no-fly zone would end war quicker, says #Poland ambassador  via @Yahoo

From a strategic comms perspective, I think the 🇺🇲 may have been mistaken in its approach to #Russia #biolabs spin. All #US did was fuel the discussion on Bio labs and lose control over the narrative. What say you #DigitalDiplomacy tweeps⁉️ 
The true is that US/EU or shortly the West doesn't give a shit about #Ukraine ukrainian sovereignty or Ukrainian people. All thay care is to damage #Russia and deal attrition to its hardware using ukrainian blood. 85% of westerner even can't show where Ukraine is on map.
