@jimsciutto The 'US view' is as usual misguided in the extreme in regard to any posited 'failure' on #Russia's part. The bottling up of #Ukrainian troops all over #Ukraine is a tactic to hold them immobile while the Ukrainian forces in the Donbass are dealt with. #Kiev #Kyiv #Donbass #Donbas

@KCChampDon @UKRinUN @SergiyKyslytsya I heard that #Russia has supplied more tanks to #ukraine than any other country.
Moms in #Russia are concerned since the #Russian ministry of #defence is simply not answering calls or replies with #bullshit like "It's a #SpecialMilitaryOperation, therefore we can't give out any pieces of information!" ... #RussiaInvadedUkraine #fckptn

No wonder Putin thinks he is winning. His generals dont dare to tell him they are loosing. “So, the main goals of the 1st stage of the special operation have already been achieved. Now there is little needed to win the war”  #thefallofputin #Ukraine #Russia #FreedomOfRussia 
#Ukrainian President #VolodymyrZelensky has said that he saw positive signals from the #PeaceTalks between #Ukraine and #Russia. "The signals we hear from the negotiating platform can be called positive," #Zelensky said in a video address.

#Russia has used banned antipersonnel mines in  #Ukraine.   These weapons do not differentiate between combatants and civilians and leave a deadly legacy for years to come. Countries around the world should forcefully condemn their use.  New from @hrw:  
#Moscow announced it will scale back military activity in #Kyiv.  #Russia said its to create mutual trust, but it's NOT a ceasefire. US officials warn it signals a shift toward maintaining a hold over Donbas. What does it actually mean? #curiositytakescourage #standwithukraine

The message to #Russia in peace negotiations over the #RussiaUkraineWar must be to return the east and Crimea and go home. Nothing else. Return what you have taken and go home.
@jimsciutto There is no failure on Russia's part. Being able to pull back forces from around Kiev is in fact a sign of success. It shows willingness to parallel a new sense of reality by the Ukrainian negotiating team. #Russia would not withdraw unless in unbeatable position in the #Donbass.
Due to a historical loophole, the Russian state legally owns less than 10% of the natural resources currently under its control #facts #russia #legal
Israeli TG channels confirmed the death of Ukrainians during the terrorist attack in Israel Eternal memory❤️ #Ukraine #UkraineWar #Russia #UkraineInvasion 
#Russia has requested military assistance from China to maintain its invasion of #Ukraine. Thanks to #America's #BusinessRoundTable who destroyed America's middle class for profit &amp; sent technology &amp; jobs to #China, Western democracies are now attacked with own technology. 
George H. W. Bush was the director of the CIA. #Putin was the director of the FSB (aka KGB). Bush served the American people. Does #PutinHitler truly serve #Russia?
