Ukrainian authorities refused #Russia’s demand to surrender in #Mariupol, saying two-thousand civilians have lost their lives in the besieged city. Some died of stress or lack of medical help.
@br020201 #Russia should be one of the biggest democratic leaders in the world today. #Putin is the ONLY reason #Russians are suffering. Just look at the numbers. Since Putin has taken over, the Russian economy has only been degrading. You have to fight for your future. UNITE! #StopPutin
When Russian invaded Ukraine, it was believed Russia might respond to U.S. sanctions by launching cyber-attacks. These have not materialized, but the U.S. government is warning they may be on the way…  #spotlink #ukrainewar #cybersecurity #russia   
It’s no wonder #russia is, I think, losing this war. 
@antonio470011 @RWApodcast @trash_catalog #Bucha and #Gostomel are under full Russian control. Both #Russia and #Ukraine report that #Irpen is currently under partial Russian control, but at this point nobody seems to know for sure the situation there.
The US &amp; #Russia control 90% of the world’s #nuclear warheads. Both can sustain a nuclear first strike from the other and still retaliate. They maintain second strike capabilities through the “nuclear triad”: bombers, submarines with nuclear missiles, and land-based missiles.

The global #highered community's reaction to #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine is quite interesting. Here, I have compiled a list of statements indicating the suspension of collaboration with Russia:  Feel free to contact me with additions. #AcademicTwitter

#Russia has cancelled negotiations with Japan on a peace treaty and also withdrawn from the dialogue on establishing joint economic activities in the southern Kuriles following Tokyo's sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine conflict. #IndiaNarrative 
Revolting excuse for a human being blaming 🇺🇦 for picking a fight with 🇷🇺. Outrageously despicable and nauseatingly disgusting piece of shit  #marjorietaylorgreene #USA #Russia #Ukraine #UkraineInvasion #UkraineUnderAttaсk 
Compared to the biggest economies in the world, #russia's GDP of $1.7T is small &amp; #ukraine's GDP of $156B is tiny.  Will a conflict between two relatively small economies create a global supply chain tsunami?  According to Professor Chris Tang, "You bet."

What @RepAdamSchiff and his admirers do not understand is that in their resistance, they are simply mirror images of Trump’s supporters.  Read @EliLake's full review of Midnight in Washington 👉   #DonaldTrump #Russia #ImpeachmentTrial

This is quite possibly the dumbest theory I’ve seen thus far to explain #Russia’s use of #hypersonic missiles.  If that was true, then after the hypersonic missiles, they would have no missiles left.   I think they just wanted to field test their new toy.
