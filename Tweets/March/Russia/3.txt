We are all getting a pretty clear picture of what modern fascist rule is like from Putin. Mobile crematoriums, martial law and no economy. #russia #Ukraine 
Our hearts, tears, emotions, love, sadness, hope, are with good #Ukrainians.  Our anger for evil Putin is strong.   We must use our anger to act, now.  We move to defend all that we love.    #Zelensky #Ukraine  #Russia  #Kyiv¬†  #Kremlin  #Ukrainians #Putin #StandwithUkraine 
#Kasparov's idea of throwing #Russia 'back into the stone age' may not be the best, but throwing Russia forward into a true #Democracy would work for everyone, except #Putin &amp; friends of course

@AndreasSteno Maybe stick to economics? Lol. If you know the situation, Ukraine will sadly be demolished or a shadow of itself before Putin is threatened. Nah the world will be threatened before Putin is threatened #UkraineRussiaWar #UkraineWar #Russia @ZelenskyyUa
@AmbHerzog @NeriZilber @yairlapid #Putin supports all of those, too.  Just not a 'sovereign' government that's a puppet of the U.S. and #NATO.  A 'sovereign' government designed to keep #Russia on permanent war footing with the West should not be supported by #Israel.
‚Äú#Ukraine accused #Russia on Tuesday of carrying out a "barbaric" rocket attack on a #Kyiv TV tower that killed five civilians near Babyn Yar, a memorial site to one of the biggest single massacres of #Jews during the #Nazi #Holocaust during #WorldWar2.‚Äù
