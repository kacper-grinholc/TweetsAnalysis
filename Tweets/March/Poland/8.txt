@SandiDeMita So the latest is that #Poland will be supplying Ukraine with Russian #MIG ‘s which 🇺🇦 pilots know how to fly. Snag: how to get planes to 🇺🇦? FFS, get 🇺🇦 pilots to Poland ASAP so they can fly them back. U don’t have to be a brain surgeon or is this a bureaucratic #thunderfuck ?🌻

Translation: "We never planned to do it."  #Ukraine needs to understand this, they are playing games. #Biden #StateDepartment &amp; #Pentagon not in good communication over this (like with Afghanistan.) #Blinken gave GREEN LIGHT for jets, did that without talking to #Poland or #DOD. 
Poland appears to be frightened of Russian reprisals after all. Surely this plays into Kremlin’s hands?US dismisses Polish plan to provide fighter jets to be sent to Ukraine #Poland #Mig29 #NATO

Great so the US is sending two missile batteries to Poland. That’s reassuring that certainly nothing will escalate past Ukraine 😐 #poland #ukraine #russia #war
@PentagonPresSec SERIOUSLY DUDE. #Ukraine #UkraineUnderAttack #Poland #Mig29 #America 
Reason #7499470379047 that NATO are sh**ebags.  Country offers up entire fleet of jets to fight a war but not to the country that are fighting the war but to another country so they can hand them to those fighting the war but they don’t want to do that.  #Ukraine #poland
Polish officials announced they would deploy #Poland’s MiG-29 fighter jets to the @USAirForce’s Ramstein Air Base in #Germany amid the #RussiaUkraineConflict, while calling on other #NATO members to transfer their MiG-29 planes to the US. 
Huge mistake. #Poland can help. We must help. What is wrong, @PentagonPresSec?! 
That is a great move. #Poland is  moving forward and taking an increasingly better position on the international stage  Blinken with his statement in Moldova surprised us then we issued a statement surprising the U.S.

#Poland is being amazingly decisive for a #European country. The #EU countries like to talk endlessly about doing things. The #US can be almost as bad. But Poland sends the jets for #Urkraine to the #US airbase in Germany. They've come to the conclusion: ...

There's a bugaboo in that...#poland wants to give America the planes to give to #Ukraine and then give them new planes...in short, Poland wants a go-between in America...we might as well go all in with a #NoFlyZoneOverUkraineNow as #Putin will see it as a declaration of war. 
#Poland, why can't the #Ukranian pilots pick up the Mig 29's from your airbases.
Quite poor, childish execution by #Poland of a decent idea/proposal. Hopefully they can still come to terms after this screw-up. As for PL fears, will always be in #Kremlin's sights no matter what, unless #Moscow is starved and driven to submission 
We'll see.  I doubt #Russia will take kindly to this, and #NATO could well be forced to abandon its obnoxious "Strategic Deterrence" if #Poland is dragged into the war.  This is important.  
@JACEcorp @GPrime85 That's not when it started. It officially started with the invasion of Poland, which bears many similarities to #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine.   Now, just like then, nobody wanted to step in to help #Poland. All stood by and watched while issuing condemnations.

It sounds like the US govt was pressuring Poland to make the deal, but the Poles were reluctant, so they finally threw up their hands and said "We'll give the MiG-29s to you and YOU give them to the Ukrainians"; now the US has cold feet. #Mig29 #Ukraine #Poland

#Poland's decision to put all its #MiG-29 #fighterjets at the disposal of the #UnitedStates was "a surprise move" by Warsaw, the U.S. State Department's No. 3 diplomat said on Tuesday. 
#Ukraine-#Russia War. #Poland's government wants to give #MIG military jets to the US/would be flown to the US military base #Ramstein in Germany. NO: Pilots of Ukraine's military would fly the jets from Ramstein to U. - intercepted by Russian jets=R.'s focus on Germany! 
Translation.... Poland called his bluff and @SecBlinken crapped it 🤡 🇵🇱  #Ukraine #Poland 
Apparently #poland wants to give the #Mig29 for a swap of American jets. And the mig29 will be used by #ukraine However it’s now said no one mentioned it to the #USA It did seem odd because I feel it would rub #putin up the wrong way &amp; increase tension #RussianUkrainianWar #news 
Imagine if #Poland weren't in #NATO, its role on this crisis would have been less hamstrung by in-fighting in #Washington. Maybe that has saved Poland from war but #Warsaw looks humiliated now and #Ukraine's hopes dashed. Cui bono? WWIII still closer than two weeks ago. 
Update — the @StateDept says #Poland’s announcement was premature &amp; not coordinated &amp; @DeptofDefense says it should be #Poland that delivers jets to #Ukraine.  What a mess. 
#USA stop fucking around and follow #Poland with their plan to get Migs to the #Ukraine, you look like fools. 🇺🇦
@KyivIndependent Wouldn’t it be something if all those #Ukrainian refugees end up being nuked in #Poland as a result of these actions, which are designed to escalate #WW3.
Someone brought a #piano to the border crossing in Medyka, #Poland tonight.  #Ukraine 
. #Poland gives ALL its MIG-29 planes to the US so they can hand them to #Ukraine.  
@KyivIndependent Dear #Refugees in #Poland by chance among the 486,000 we have , anyone knows how's to fly a MIG? Any MIG refuge pilot from Syria or Afghanistan? #Ukraine needs you.
@KyivIndependent 🤦‍♀️ Poland is too much of a chicken &amp; wants to make sure that #Putin doesn't have a reason to invade them. But here is the thing, Putin doesn't need a reason-he will make up a reason for an invasion if he really wants to invade. Also, the pro-Russia party is in charge in #Poland.

God bless the people of  #Poland for all they are doing for the #Ukrainian population fleeing war - I am ashamed at how little the #UK government is currently doing to host refugees- including from Afghanistan
"#Poland has said it will hand over its MiG-29 fighter jets to the #US, which is then expected to donate them to #Ukraine amid intelligence agency warnings that Vladimir Putin is about to 'double down' in his invasion..."

I know it’s suppose to go to a person, this year it should go to a country.  The incredible country of #Poland deserves the #NoblePeacePrize for 2022! They define the award.   🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼#UkraineUnderAttack 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼  #UkraineWillResist #NoMoreWar #Ukrainian 
#EU just look how #Poland manages the situation with #refugees, now you understand that there's a difference between those who try to sneak into EU and who really tries to run from war. Zero camps needed, zero incidents on borders, 100% care about all refugees from #Ukraine!
I have deep respect for the #Ukraine People for their bravery in defending their Nation but I'm also grateful for countries like #Poland and other neighboring countries for supporting all the refugees 🇺🇦🇵🇱🇭🇺🇷🇴🇸🇰🇲🇩
Poland to give MiG-29 jets to US for expected donation to Ukraine  #Poland is playing a risky game that will be met with subsequent consequences &amp; repercussions from #Russia #RussianArmy #Russia &amp; #Poland #Baltic states are next to be invaded #Ukraine️

Oh noooooo how will the Russians survive without pink slime nuggets? 😭  #McDonalds #UkraineRussianWar #CocaCola #Kiev #Kharkiv #Putin #Biden #Zelenskiy #nato #Poland  
Meanwhile as the whole WESTern world argues ovrr #Ukraine...  *Poland rises up &amp; gives entire polish Air Force stock of MIG/29 fighter jets to Ukraine free of charge*   #Russia #UkraineRussianWar #UkraineUnderAttack #USA #Poland #Latvia #Estonia #Lithuania #Hungary #Moldova #GFU 
This must happen now Ukraine war: #Poland offers all its MIG-29 fighter jets to US in plan to provide aircraft to #Kyiv  
@SkyNews @afneil Wouldn't #Poland ( and by extension #EU) directly get involved in this war if it's fighter planes were passed to #Ukraine 🤔🤔
Thank you #Poland and #Biden for getting this done!!!!!! #GetThemPlanes!!! 
Poland’s Foreign Ministry Affairs claims it would not allow American MIG-29 to fly from #Poland to #Ukraine.  Polish government wants to transport the planes to Germany. 
@gavin_hewitt @Andrzejtla @mrsorokaa Americans will just chill on the other side of the Atlantic.  Have fun living next to a really pissed off neighbour that knows how to hold a grudge and feels backstabbed that one time #Poland.
1991 - Lithuanians were stopping russian tanks with bare hands. #Lithuania destroys #CCCP. 2022 - Ukrainians are stopping russian tanks with bare hands and some modern equipment. #Ukraine destroys #russia. Looks like Grand Duchy of Lithuania still exists! P.S. #Poland we ❤️ you!
.@VP, hoping your trip to Europe this week is safe and productive!  President "#Biden sends [VP Kamala] #Harris to #Poland and #Romania amid global crisis." 
@ZelenskyyUa @POTUS I’m psyched we’ve worked a deal with you and #Poland to get you more jets!
@IAPonomarenko That's impressiv. They know what time it is. Thx #Poland 🇲🇨🇺🇦
