.@DmytroKuleba: “Our visit to #Poland has three objectives. The first is to thank #Poles for everything they’ve done. We want you to know that #Ukraine is grateful for everything you’ve done so far”.  
#Poland announced steps Wednesday to end all #Russian oil imports by the end of 2022; it has already banned #coal from #Russia. #Ukraine #UkraineWar #russianinvasion @TheWeekLive 
And #NATO still not allow the sale of aircraft from #Poland to #Ukraine Nor does it authorize aerial control of the Ukrainian sky Ask yourself if #NATO peoples are free to help a nation in need that is being unjustly gunned down by murderous killers? #War make billionaires richer
