#Russia shelling a Ukrainian military base near #Poland is a probe of NATO's intentions:   "Are you coming to #WestUkraine or not?"
Fantastic work by @squad3o3, named after Polish RAF 303 Squadron, to get the truth out there. Following in the footsteps of #Poland's codebreaking giants who bested the Nazi's Enigma code and the Bolsheviks during the deceive 1920 Battle of Warsaw!

Thank you, Zbigniew Rau #Poland’s Foreign Minister &amp; Chairperson of the Organization 4 Security &amp; Cooperation in Europe @OSCE.  When asked about the MiG Jets "This kind of decision has to be made by @NATO Alliance as a whole ..."  At the 9:54 mark 
Here are my little Easter eggs from Poland: from Krakow a few years ago; I will be hanging them proudly and thinking of #Poland helping #Ukraine in these times of war. #RefugeesWelcome #Easter #Lent 
Our team of volunteers have been outstanding over in Poland ensuring hundreds of hot meals are being served a day for everyone arriving at the border.   #khalsaaid #humanitarianaid #poland #ukraine #ukrainewar 
'An avalanche of help': #International #community rallies to bring 50 #Ukrainians back to the #Axarquía  A bus left #Nerja on Sunday headed to the #Poland-#Ukraine #border and is expected to arrive back in #Malaga on Friday   @JennieR28313831 reports

#Germany tells #Poland to stop sending them trains full of refugees from #Ukraine  After all, they are already caring for a million men from around the world who identify as 17 year old Syrians. 
Fears three British ex-special forces troops killed by Russian attack in #Ukraine: Dozens died in missile strike close to Ukrainian border with #Nato member #Poland on Sunday in most westerly attack yet by Russian forces #Russia 
Today I was at refugee shelter in #Katowice #Poland The people of #Ukraine are in good hands in here 🤍❤ 🇵🇱 🇺🇦  However, I've never seen so many sad kids 😔 💙💛
Not a #NoFlyZone exactly, but #Poland reasonably could  say that any missile or aircraft aggressively approaching its border--within 100km--is subject to interception. That airspace belongs to #Ukriane, not #Russia; so who could complain? Seriously: It's no time for Polish jokes! 
2) #NATO weapons convoys are being targeted by Russia near #Poland. Matter of time NATO drags Poland into the war. If not careful, Poland may figure again in history books as the pathway to @WW3. #UkraineWar  
1) With #NATO landing weapons into #Poland destined for Ukraine, convoys carrying arms will be legitimate target for the Russian army, air force or missiles. Like WWII, Poland could again be the reason for #WW3. #UkraineWar @WW3Info 
People from #Poland 🇵🇱! Do you actually like these? Because I LOVE them!!!!! 
Iraq’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday that nearly 1,000 Iraqis have left #Ukraine for #Poland since the begging of Russia’s invasion of the country. #NRTnews #UkraineWar 
I’m not big on Nationalism but given the circumstances atm it’s worth mentioning how proud I am to be Polish. my mother’s father left his sister in Poland to come to America w/ his parents at the start of the last century. 🇵🇱❤️🇺🇦 #Poland 
Russian missile attack some 15 miles from #NATO member #Poland stirs anxiety, spurs Poles to rush to passport offices, stockpile essentials; 'Everybody is a little bit afraid.' 
The beard secret @beardstruggle #London #BeardGang #Poland #beardman 
Polish demonstrators have blocked the path of lorries with Russian and Belarusian number plates trying to cross into Belarus. The right-wing government is not reacting by supporting Putin's regime.  #Poland #Polen #Pologne #Polonia #RussiaUkraineWar
Is it possible the Putin is so determined is due to China already backing him?? … Enquiring Minds want to know? … #USA #Canada #Ukraine🇺🇦#Poland #Germany #Israel #Japan … Someone knows! 🌏🌍🌎🤔

Young Argentinians travelled from #Israel to the border of #Poland and #Ukraine to provide humanitarian aid  @argenisrael @CancilleriaARG @SantiagoCafiero @SergioUrribarri #Ukraine #Russia #UkraineRussiaWar #UkraineRussiaCrisis #UkraineUnderAttack  
Why has the #EU voted to put economic sanctions on #Poland after they have taken in so many #Refugees ? 
Reports are circulating that #Russia could use chemical or biological weapons as their military strikes move closer to #Poland's border. 
At #Poland's #Medyka border, Mornay is one of seven former members of the French Foreign Legion, an elite military force, who are voluntarily providing their own security to #refugees and are on the lookout for traffickers. - Kyiv #Kharkiv #Donetsk #Chernihiv  #Ukraine Lviv Киев 
@GBNEWS After trampling all over #Poland in WW2 #Germany should pay for infrastructure in Poland for Ukrainian refugees. They can use the Euros they saved when underfunding #NATO for years.

#EuropeanUnion may delay invoking conditionality mechanism for alleged #RuleOfLaw infringement of #Hungary and #Poland who are receiving #Refugees fleeing #war in #Ukraine   
And is #putin not seeing this, is he not seeing the #protests? Stop this madness, stop this war on #Ukraine. First #crimea then  #ukraine, next #poland #hungary #latvia and so on. @BorisJohnson @trussliz @pritipatel
#Poland in #G20 = very big YES, but not now of course... 👇 
#Polish Border Guard said that 1.77 million refugees from #Ukraine have arrived in #Poland since the beginning of the war
❗ #Poland received over 1.8mln refugees from #Ukraine since February 24 - Secretary of State  #Russian Ministry of Defence briefing:  ▪️ High-precision weapons hit several Ukrainian military objects, a large ammunition depot destroyed on the territory of the Antonov plant;
the example of #Poland  and #Romania  gave legitimacy to Russia's concerns, both countries joined the alliance and hosting aegis ashore missile defense and anti ballistic interceptor systems. 117 #UkraineWar
#Estonia and #Latvia, former republics of the Soviet Union, are already #NATO member states directly on Russia’s borders.  #Poland  another neighbor hosts NATO missile base 100 miles from the #Russian  border 111 #RussianArmy #RussiaUkraine
