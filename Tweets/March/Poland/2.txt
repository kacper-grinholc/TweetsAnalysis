@IkInvivo @Reuters Don't lie. My friends in Krosno, #Poland took home 5 #African (#Gambian) students from the border. A lot of different nationalities arriving eg. at the train station in #Przemyśl. There are of course some incidents but even some Ukrainians are blocking each other. This is panic.

@bchesky is there a way to donate for free stays for refugee #Ukrainians in your locations? I do not have an apartment or house to host them, but would be happy to donate. If possible in #Romania, #Poland, #Moldova, #Slovakia where most of them fled to.

@RikardJozwiak #Poland took equivalent to 1.3% of population and is going to take sth about 3-5%, so 2M of refugees. But I understand, that 5M euro is not enough. #Moldova can ask EU as UN for additional resources to help with humanitarian crisis.
Thank you #Poland for helping the #AnimalsOfUkraine 
@RzecznikMSZ @politico you have my respect #Poland #PolandFirstToHelp
