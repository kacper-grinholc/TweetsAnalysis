As a slav, I concur #StandWithUkraine️ #Poland #CzechRepublic #Slovenia 
#Zelensky &amp; PM's of #Poland, #Czech, &amp; Slovenia, said 'the Western states with the most power must start taking risks, or it will end like Munich 1938.'  I would expect them to take this posturing. The coolest heads will prevail during this dire dynamic...
