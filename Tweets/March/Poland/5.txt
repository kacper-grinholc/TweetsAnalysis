#BREAKING Rep @CongressmanRaja #Krishnamoorthi attended #Zoom w/ #Zelenski Sat AM, says #Ukraine pilots trained on #Russian jets, not western. Rep Raja says #NATO member #Poland could provide the jets, but if #Putin retaliates, does it start WW3 when NATO defends  member-Poland?

Who remembers the start of #WW2? PM #Chamberlain of the UK also thought it was fine after the Munich Agreement that #Hitler (after Austria) also occupied Czechoslovakia. Hitler knew enough. No military resistance, so #Poland was taken. History repeats itself. #EU 
Poland must give their  Russian made jets to Ukraine because those are the only jets that the Ukrainian Pilots know how to fly If they don't they're going to regret it because Putin will be in Poland next if they don't #Poland #StopRussiaNOW #StandWithUkraine️  #🇺🇦

@Kolotnev Like @AnitkaWal mentioned, it is not a) American, b) blogger, c) in #Poland or d) about #Russia, but an Austrian reporter in Wienna about a demonstration.  The tweet is a #fake and malicious war #propaganda for the Russian attacker. 
If *I* know they're flying into Rzeszów-Jasionka #EPRZ in #Poland, the whole Russian MoD knows. It's not a secret. Any reporter who doesn't publish that fact is not doing their job, and they're allowing themselves to be bullied by the U.S. Gov't.
