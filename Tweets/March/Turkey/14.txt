Urgent Reuters: #Turkish_President Tayyip #Erdogan said on Monday it was too early to comment on #Turkey's possible purchase of more #Russian_weapons given #Moscow's invasion of #Ukraine, and #Ankara would decide after seeing what conditions arise. 
While the courts are busy trying to make the murder of #KemalKurkut disappear, journalist Abdurrahman Gök who documented the murder is going through hellish legal harassment. Hear his story👇 #Turkey #pressfreedom #JournalismIsNotACrime

#Turkey and #Greece are neighbors, friends, #NATO members and their peoples are in contact with each other.  If other countries (#USA #FRANCE) become enemies with their provocation and games and become war, both countries will fall into the current situation of #UKRAINE  #Europe

What #hubris, what #condescension! One might think that the Western agitators are ripe for the closed psychiatric ward. Who is not participating in the sanctions so far? #India #Serbia #China #UAE #Turkey #Venezuela #Iran ? - geopolitical #colonialism

The regime in #Turkey has ever since been based on a male-dominated, patriarchal, and militaristic mindset. Recently this mindset has merged with political Islamist thought &amp; discourse which expanded the extent and form of #violence against #women.  #LetUsTalk #WomensHistoryMonth
