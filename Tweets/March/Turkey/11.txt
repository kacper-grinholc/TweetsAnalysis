@Charles_Lister @oryxspioenkop @suheilhammoud Because there is no russians in #Syria ? Or because #Turkey is not allowing him to go after those forces..? I don't understand a #syrian wanting to fight somewhere else while his country has a big job market for that same purpose!
@Ullizee @Scrumdotorg I wish the same could apply also to other countries who have also invaded .Does anybody remember #Turkey invasion in Cyprus back in 1974 ? Do politicians and global communities have selective memory?
#Istanbul #ShibaArmy #Turkey Will /is the Turkish Government adopting #shibainu ? 
There a plenty of russian troops around, also Al Qaeda, #Syria is full of hostile forces, including iran and #Turkey which doesn't allow you to attack the russians around, so why not shut the F up, and keep your turkish pay check coming... way better dude. 
@shiftingshifter @JohnDoe92915159 Yes, after two illegal invasions &amp; 46 years of illegal occupation on the island, it’s abundantly clear what  #Turkey’s intentions were.

The western countries sanction #Russia for invading #Ukraine and that’s the right thing to do.  At the same time they don’t care about the illegal invasion and the consequent occupation of half of #Cyprus by #Turkey since 1974.  Why such double standards? #DoubleStandards 
@kazastel @jensstoltenberg @RTErdogan #Turkey is not living with #EU debt money like #Greece unfortunately.
It's not in #Israel's interests to prop up #Putin at this time. In fact, #Israel has a good opportunity to work with #Turkey &amp; capitalize on #Russia's current weakness in #Syria. #Erdogan is not trustworthy, but minimizing #Russia's presence in #Syria is in his interests.
Gee, thanks for your second-guessing, Erdogan. And, just by the bye, where were you when the shit hit the fan in Crimea? Standing on the sidelines? Bravo! #Turkey #Erdogan 
@shiftingshifter @JohnDoe92915159 Yes it does sound flexible but the key words to Article IV are "three guaranteeing Powers reserve[s] the right to take action with the sole aim of re-establishing the state of affairs created by the present Treaty" #Turkey invaded #Cyprus but didn't return back to the status-quo

At least it can be considered as a preparatory stage for a possible meeting between the leaders of #Ukraine and #Russia. Only @RTErdogan  can arrange a meeting between @ZelenskyyUa and @KremlinRussia_E, which is also possible in #Turkey.
