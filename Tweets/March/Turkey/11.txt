@Charles_Lister @oryxspioenkop @suheilhammoud Because there is no russians in #Syria ? Or because #Turkey is not allowing him to go after those forces..? I don't understand a #syrian wanting to fight somewhere else while his country has a big job market for that same purpose!
@Ullizee @Scrumdotorg I wish the same could apply also to other countries who have also invaded .Does anybody remember #Turkey invasion in Cyprus back in 1974 ? Do politicians and global communities have selective memory?
#Istanbul #ShibaArmy #Turkey Will /is the Turkish Government adopting #shibainu ? 
There a plenty of russian troops around, also Al Qaeda, #Syria is full of hostile forces, including iran and #Turkey which doesn't allow you to attack the russians around, so why not shut the F up, and keep your turkish pay check coming... way better dude.

The western countries sanction #Russia for invading #Ukraine and that‚Äôs the right thing to do.  At the same time they don‚Äôt care about the illegal invasion and the consequent occupation of half of #Cyprus by #Turkey since 1974.  Why such double standards? #DoubleStandards 
@kazastel @jensstoltenberg @RTErdogan #Turkey is not living with #EU debt money like #Greece unfortunately.
It's not in #Israel's interests to prop up #Putin at this time. In fact, #Israel has a good opportunity to work with #Turkey &amp; capitalize on #Russia's current weakness in #Syria. #Erdogan is not trustworthy, but minimizing #Russia's presence in #Syria is in his interests.
Gee, thanks for your second-guessing, Erdogan. And, just by the bye, where were you when the shit hit the fan in Crimea? Standing on the sidelines? Bravo! #Turkey #Erdogan

@abhangoksu @markito0171 You are wrong. #Turkey &amp; #USA did not finalize an agreement under Obama and Turkey refused a better offer under Trump.  Turkish Air Force &amp; SSB wanted Patriot, but overruled by #Erdogan.  A loss for Turkey, #NATO, and USA.
Excellent piece by @mehmtalaca on Kurdish aspirations to export natural gas to #Turkey amid Iraqi top court's ruling that Kurds must hand over oil ops.   Turkey could help #Iraq lessen reliance on Iranian energy imports‚Äîbut only with buy-in from Baghdad. 
Hypocrisy is worst when it‚Äôs from within! Today Turkey declared that it stands apart from the Arab Muslim world while normalizing with the apartheid non-state! #Turkey

#Libya: Most foreign powers have declined to take sides so far. #Russia is the only state to recognise the #Bashagha government. #Moscow had last year supported General #Haftar's military campaign against the #Tripoli government, which #Turkey backed. 
Turkey won‚Äôt sanction Russia, despite NATO pressure ‚Äì reports - Well done #Turkey for not being a #NATO and #US vassal!. Time the NATO made their own decisions, if not scrap NATO. @Plaid_Erdogan @PresidentOfTurk
