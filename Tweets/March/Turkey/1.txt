Questions for #Kosovo Presid. @VjosaOsmaniPRKS  :  1 Did you asked President @RTErdogan to lift #Turkey 's veto on #Cyprus entry in #NATO , in exchange of recognition of independence of #Kosovo by Cyprus ? 2 Is this one of those 3 deals your FM @gervallaschwarz signed ? 👇👇 
“We appreciate the efforts to get #Ukraine into the #EU. But I say to these #EU members, why are you still worried about taking #Turkey into the #EU. Show the same sensitivity for #Turkey as you do about #Ukraine,” #Turkey’s President, #Erdogan said.”

Europe didn't act against #Turkey when they invaded #Cyprus in 1974. It's our moral obligation to prevent this from happening again. We move on, but don't forget. #StandWithUkraine 
#Turkey rules out sanctions on #Russia, says it would not want to see harm come to commercial interests and tourism revenue according to Turkish president's spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin.   #UkraineRussiaWar 
#Turkey does not plan to impose sanctions against #Russia. 
#Turkey's Black Sea warning may impact #Syria more than #Ukraine 
Did #Kosovo 's Presid. @VjosaOsmaniPRKS  at the interview with @Nafisa_Latic called #Turkey's President #RecepTayyipErdoğan to switch off #Putin 's #TurkStream #gas #pipeline, as one of the strongest solidarity measure with #Ukraine against #Russia 's aggression ???   @trtworld 
#Turkey’s Presence in Northern #Syria – Kashmir Reader
@POTUS Also Mr. President don't forget to make accountable #Turkey and #Azerbaijan for 2020 #NagornoKarabakh war they killed 5000 armenians and destroyed our cultural monuments, hospitals kindergardens and schools.
#Turkey wants a ceasefire on #Ukraine so it can send MORE #TB2 UAVs.  I believe #Russia destroyed almost if not all TB2 that were in UA officially but right before combats started, TWO Turkish Cargo Military Planes arrived on UA (&amp; still there AFAIK).  I bet they delivered TB2s.
This is why Turkey not feel very well in this case.... #UkraineRussiaWar  #UkraineRussiaCrisis  #Turkey  #Kurdistan

Turkey still haven’t closed their airspace to Russian planes.  I suggest that when you book your summer holidays you boycott Turkey. #BoycottTurkey #Turkey #jet2holidays #Cyprus #Erdogan #Europe #Tui

Revisionist &amp; expansionist #Turkey systematically attacks its neighbors. Turkey claims territory from 5 of its 8 neighbors under the pretense of "national security".  It's exactly what #Russia is doing to #Ukraine. #EU &amp; #NATO should also sanction Turkey.  (h/t @NikosMichailid4)

#Turkey’s #Erdogan Calls for Immediate #Ukraine-Russia Ceasefire, Supports #NATO Enlargement 
#Turkey has gone ahead with closing the Black Sea to foreign warships after implementing the #MontreuxConvention yesterday.   It is a universal prohibition that did not single out #Russia.  
#Turkey president Erdoğan praises antiwar protesters in Moscow but he called antiwar protesters in Turkey "terrorists, and traitors" when he occupied Northern Syria's city of #Efrîn in 2018, where Kurds live; and jailed many of them.   #Rojava #Ukraine
@ragipsoylu #Turkey is not threatened by neighbouring countries (instead Turkey has been threatening them and has even invaded a few). Also, Turkey already has a candidate status but instead of making progress it is taking steps backwards.
#Turkey supplied neo-Nazis in #Ukraine with drones and neo-Nazis are proudly showing what they've done with the Turkish drones, as they showed Russian soldiers killed by them.   Friendship between Nazis and Islamist is not new, it goes back to Hitler and Mufti of Jerusalem.
@ragipsoylu No it will not.  #Turkey invaded #Cyprus The same way #Russia is invading #Ukraine
