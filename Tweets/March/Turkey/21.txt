#Turkey has followed the same failed racist policy of labeling the Kurds who ‘refuse to be Turks’ as ‘terrorists’ for 100 years! It has made Kurds stronger! If I was the Turkish state I’d be thinking how can we make peace with the Kurds &amp; make amends for our crimes! #Newroz2022 
@JosepBorrellF Europe was in danger when #Turkey invaded to #Cyprus . Europe was in danger since February 2020 when #Turkey used immigrants against Greece to blackmail Europe.  Europe was and still is in danger when #Turkey questioned a European's country sovereignty (Greece's).
