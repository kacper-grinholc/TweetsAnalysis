Russian FM #Lavrov arrives in Turkey for a trilateral summit with #Ukraine's FM #Kuleba and Turkish FM #Çavuşoğlu. #Russia #Turkey
What is certain, is that the #EastMed security architecture is undergoing another important change akin - though reverse - to that of the early 2010s. And it was expected as analysed here:   Maybe the #Turkey-#Egypt relationship is next.   End of #thread.
#Turkey-#Israel might get there, but they're not there yet.   It's however true that many actors might want to support such a project, such as the US &amp; EU. It serves Western interests, it'd be relatively cheap - cheaper, more feasible &amp; more competitive than #EastMed pipeline.&gt;
#Israel is pursuing similar objective and also, importantly, the change of #Turkey's stance vis-a-vis #Hamas. Whether that will materialize remains to be seen.  Now, with all the chaos around the #UkraineRussiaWar, what about this pipeline?
(including the #EastMed pipeline) or within the #EMFG (w the exception of course of #Egypt), #Turkey seemed to offer at least theoretically another option to reach #Europe. Thus a the idea of a #Turkey-#Israel - that was floating around early/mid-2010s - is back on the table.  &gt;
ISR also understands, as it always has, that #Turkey is a regional power that cannot be ignored. Be it because of its role in #Syria, its power projection in the #EastMed, its leverage with #Iran, &amp; perhaps most importantly its support of the Palestinians and specifically #Hamas.
This change included efforts for - at least tactically - improved relations with #Israel, #Egypt, #Greece, #UAE, #KSA, #Armenia etc.  The new government in #Israel did not carry the baggage of the breakdown with #Turkey and therefore wasn't as invested in prolonging the stalemate
See this on #Turkey's strategy in the #EastMed in Foreign Policy:   and this book: 
🧵On #Turkey-#Israel and talk of a #gas pipeline  After a tour in #Greece and #Cyprus, that aimed at appeasing their concerns, Israeli president was today visiting Turkey in the context of improving bilateral relations. Its the first visit by an Israeli president since 2008. &gt;

Carlos: Somewhere of #Ukraine will be destroyed and many Russian soldier will be killed. #Turkey has very interesting role in the war. They seem like supporting Ukraine. And they have good tactical relations with #Russians.
As FMs #Lavrov and Kuleba are headed to #Antalya for #Russia - #Ukraine talks tomorrow, what role for #Turkey (and #Israel) in mediating &amp; messaging in #UkraineWar? 👇 
It will be an order where Russia will demand greater acquiescence. #Iran and to a certain extent #Turkey will be critical. Hierarchy will be a dominating feature in the new system.
