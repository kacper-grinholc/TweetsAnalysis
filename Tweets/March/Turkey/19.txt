@hbarkey What is more giving s400 to #Ukriane will be considered a direct hostile move by #Russia and I don't think #turkey wants to find itself into such a position
Turkey is one of the actors mediating b/ 🇺🇦 &amp; 🇷🇺.Erdogan is also eyeing #Turkey becoming the route for the flow of cash&amp; assets #Putin’s oligarchs are tying to smuggle from Western countries sanctioning 🇷🇺. Long story short, Erdogan wants to be prime beneficiary of the conflict.
@storcek @BioRecTech @olex_scherba Folks, I dont think he's automatically a bad person or bad character. Stop it!  He was educated to work for #Russia navy and attack whatever enemy they are ordered to attack.  Could have been #Turkey #Erdogan that RU went to war. Could have been Japan.   He can NOT say no!
#S400 #Τουρκια  #Turkey  #Ukriane  Well, I think I have a better idea of Turkey’s government providing USA with the sophisticated S-400 antiaircraft system to eliminate them, so it could open the way to resume shipments of its F-35's GTI Supersonic.  Isn't that brilliant?
