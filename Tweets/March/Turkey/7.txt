My two cents is that #Erdoğan is making some in-roads that other interlocutors like @naftalibennett and @EmmanuelMacron have been unable to make, likely because of the sway he carries with @ZelenskyyUa (who is insistent on #Turkey's role in negotiations) and
given that they managed to convince #Ukraine and #Russia to come to #Turkey for talks this week.   Does this mean they are likely to be particularly successful at this? Not yet.   Does it mean they can't be? Not necessarily either.
Is this a good thing? Depending who you ask and their view on #Turkey's balancing attempts between #Russia/#NATO, its proof of Ankara being unrealiable.   But alternative take is that it could help position them diplomatically as an interlocutor-
So #Russia has published its naughty list of unfriendly states and none of the entries are at all surprising.   But unsurprisingly #Turkey was excluded. A quick🧵

NEW: Amid struggle over #Iraq's next government, @amwajmedia has learned that Parliament Speaker Halbousi has received a "threat" from #Iran.  This comes amid controversy over photo op with Erdogan &amp; #Turkey's spy chief  Superb deep dive by @SaadoonMustafa
Maybe this whole charade ⬇️ would carry actual weight if the EU didn't close its eyes to countless other #HumanRights abusers. First &amp; foremost, #Erdoğan 's #Turkey who receives 🇪🇺 funding while he weaponises immigration. Unless the below reminisces about #MuslimBrotherhood 🙄

@Wyn50 @TheRickWilson I agree with the former. But the latter... #GOP supported his un-patriotic policies in #Syria both with regards to #Russia and #Turkey.  They fear his social networking capabilities - thinking they'd lose their next election.  Yes, they would have backed him up.
