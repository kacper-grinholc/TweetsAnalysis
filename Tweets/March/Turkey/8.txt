they better keep minding their words. #turkey #pressfreedom 
#Turkey has traditionally been a great resource in the transference of weaponry between States and factions the world over in many conflicts.  #UkraineWar  #Ukraine    #Mig29
The world no longer revolves around the West's axis. The American, British plan to launch wars spanning the ‘middle corridor’ has materialized. A trap will also be set for #Turkey!  #USA #UK #Europe #Russia #Ukraine #RussiaUkraineWar #NATO #geopolitics  
President Erdogan is trying to prevent war in #Ukraine. Pay very close attention to the #BlackSea! What’s behind Herzog’s planned visit to #Turkey? Encirclement fronts are collapsing one after the other!  21/01/2022  #USA #Israel #Russia #RussiaUkraineWar 
Good Night 💤  #Turkey 🇹🇷❤️ 
Will war break out in #Ukraine, or will the West stoke a #Turkey-#Russia conflict? What sort of game is being played in the #BlackSea?  #USA #UK #RussiaUkraineWar #NATO #geopolitics #geostrategy 
The crisis in #Ukraine will only be exacerbated. The West will settle into the #BlackSea. Breaking out a #Turkey-#Russia war is the West’s primary goal. Erdoğan and Putin must put a stop to this!  #USA #UK #RussiaUkraineWar #NATO #geopolitics #geostrategy 
The #Ukraine conflict: Wars are shifting from the #MiddleEast to #Europe for the first time since WWII. A ‘Western Defense Line’ is being built from the Baltic to the Aegean region  #USA #UK #Turkey #Russia #RussiaUkraineWar #NATO #geopolitics #geostrategy

Putin has launched an 'Age of Madness'! Will there be a #Turkey-#Russia war?  #USA #UK #Europe #Ukraine #RussiaUkraineWar #NATO #geopolitics  
A European war is raging in #Ukraine—and it isn’t likely to end soon. Why is the West trying to drag #Turkey into a war with #Russia?  #USA #UK #Europe #RussiaUkraineWar #NATO #geopolitics  
A missile may ‘mistakenly’ hit a Turkish ship in the #BlackSea, leading to a possible war between #Turkey and #Russia! They’re going to attempt this ploy, but we will not shed blood for #Europe’s welfare!  #USA #UK #RussiaUkraineWar #NATO #geopolitics
