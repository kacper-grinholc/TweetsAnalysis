Turkey and Greece strengthen ties in exceptional meeting - #istanbul #meeting #greece #turkey #athens #ankara 
#Shenzhen lock down. 4th in volume world wide.  #Ukraine️ #Russia #Poland #Turkey #Germany #DavosAgenda 
with talk about a #Turkey-#Israel pipeline or even the idea that #Cyprus could somehow be part of this equation as well (this is a big &amp; hypothetical discussion, partly covered in the previous thread I did on TR-ISR).  Overall, the outcome of this meeting sldn't be exaggerated &gt;
w West for a while (especially under #Biden). [More on #Turkey's balancing between #Russia &amp; West in future thread.]  The big picture includes scenarios of #energy cooperation as well; both countries would be interested in something like that. This should be seen in conjunction &gt;
#Turkey wants stability as well: domestic economic concerns, historic upcoming elections. It also wants to enhance its image as an actor of stability and mediation even as it sends the message that it remains committed to #NATO. Ankara's been trying to reconfigure its relations&gt;
The main priority of this meeting was to make sure that the next few months at least will be uneventful between the two countries. The #UkraineRussiaWar made this even more necessary for #NATO, the #US, the #EU but also #Greece and #Turkey individually. &gt;
It sld be noted that Western (esp. #US) efforts for a shift in the #EastMed (including #Greece-#Turkey &amp; Turkey-#Israel) became more evident with US non-paper on the EastMed pipeline. US moves converged (not coincidentally) w #Erdogan's efforts to normalise regional relations. &gt;
🧵 on the #Erdogan-#Mitsotakis meeting. #Greece #Turkey   Apparently today's meeting went well. This is another step towards the improvement of relations after the crisis of 2020 (escalation) and the resumption of exploratory talks in 2021 (de-escalation).   &gt;&gt;

Appearing on @ManotoNews, our Senior Fellow @docsozeren, w/ @le_negar, discussed #Israel President Isaac Herzog's visit to #Turkey, the prospect of Turkey-Israel relations, new energy initiatives, and their impact on the region.   #تركيا #إسرائيل #منوتوخبر 
#Turkey has condemned ballistic missile attack on #Israeli espionage center in #Erbil calling it unacceptable.  However, Turkey's attack of Kurdish villages and killing Kurds in Turkey, Syria and Iraq is acceptable.
🇹🇷Turkish #bayraktar TB2 ‘TCS1’ (hex #4B8354) out of Keşan Airport observed patrolling the 🇬🇷#Greece / #Turkey border earlier today. This hex# has traditionally been associated with Gendarmerie ‘TCJ39’ but curiously is now flying as Turkish Army ‘TCS1’. 
"Manned warplanes will no longer be developed. From now on, the most powerful elements of the battlefield will be unmanned systems," said Bayraktar. #Turkey 
Awesome!  #Turkey🇹🇷 and #Greece🇬🇷leaders are meeting to discuss the transfer of natural gas to Europe, amidst #RussiaUkraineWar   👉Both countries are geographically located at the southern gates of #Europe  Details👇  
#Turkey joining #Nato was a deal long back in 1952.   #JensStoltenberg could not make it  happen with #Ukraine and #Zelensky .   Reasons best known to him. 
Following the diplomatic initiative of #Turkey to mediate between #Ukraine and #Russia, it is now #Qatar's turn. Russia's #Lavrov naturally and evidently is more than happy to meet with them. 1/2
Israel, Turkey and China must work together, with a plan and try to negotiate with Russia to end this war. The war has to stop now. The indiscriminate killing of civilians and children is unacceptable. #Turkey #Israel #China
