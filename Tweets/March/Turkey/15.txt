#Turkey's shuttle diplomacy comes after it mediated talks between the foreign ministers of #Russia and #Ukraine last week in the southern resort Antalya
#Turkey created various problems and then presented itself as the solution.  Thus, the West shld approach #Turkey's 'return' w caution, given that it might well prove opportunistic and a means of sustaining/promoting its  assertive foreign policy agenda.   End of Thread.
For the time being, it is a delicate but not unsuccessful act. And this is partly because of #Turkey's geostrategic position, national power capabilities, and foreign policy actions over the past few years. This includes the fact that &gt;&gt;
It is now more evident than ever.   It should be noted that this is a very conscious approach by #Turkey. Among other things it aims at contributing to the emergence of a post-Western &amp; non-Western international order. One in which itself &amp; "the Rest" will have a greater role. &gt;
This complex reality - made possible because of the global diffusion of power - has allowed #Turkey to emerge as a 'third pole' in the international system, and especially in the emerging international order against the background of the #UkraineUnderAttack. &gt;&gt;
#US isn't entirely satisfied but it indulges #Turkey insofar as thit foreign policy shift brings about more regional stability (for now), and has at least a principled Western stance. And, on #Ukraine, #Turkey's stance is pro-Wester, despite the non imposition of sanctions. &gt;
to be speaking on equal terms with the great powers.  To convince, #Turkey highlights that it has been able to collaborate with #Russia despite their bilateral tensions. In other words, it has compartmentalized this relationship. And it looks to do the same with the #US.
b) considered a reliable ally by #NATO/West, c) it doesn't harm its own interests (e.g. economy, political stability).  #Turkey's argument is that this is a brave new world. A post-American world. One in which it is entitled a greater role; &gt;&gt;
However he did not perceive this as a return to the previous state of affairs. #Turkey still wants to be autonomous. So now it finds itself having to adopt anti-Russian policies. And it does so but only to the extent that it is: a) not perceived hostile by #Russia, &gt;&gt;
A Quran course instructor has blamed the children he sexually abused and said he was wrongfully being accused by them as they were having difficulties memorizing the Islamic holy book. #Turkey 
In the brief I refer to some of the ways that Turkey is trying not engage both 'poles' even as it antagonizes them. New #Turkey wants to be autonomous and independent. The first side effect of this approach was its relationship with the West. In 2015-2016 it turned to #Russia. &gt;&gt;
the #UnitedStates and #Russia.  But the #UkraineWar expanded the framework of this discussion. And it created certain dynamics that point to a transition from multipolarity to a peculiar bipolarity. #Turkey seems reluctant to box itself into these 'camps' that are taking shape.
This was a result of the multipolarization of the international system and domestic politics - especially the #AKP identity/ideology. It was of course assumed that #Turkey had to deal with the two main poles of the system, the East and West. In the Middle East this meant &gt;&gt;
It is based on an idea/concept that I first published in a paper with @ForeignGR in 2016. The argument was that #Turkey was emerging as a 'third pole' in the international system. &gt;&gt; 
🧵 New policy brief: "The #UkraineWar and #Turkey as a 'Third Pole' in a New International Order"  I promised I would write something about Turkey's balancing act. This is my brief &amp; humble contribution to the discussion:  &gt;&gt;
