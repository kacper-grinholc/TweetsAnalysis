It's time for every revolutionary force in #Syria to attack every #russia military settlement. Guess who won't allow that... the #turkey occupiers.
This is true. Unfortunately many Greek as well as Turkish #Cypriots have internalised the false Turkish narrative about the reasons for the invasion and occupation. We need to address this if we ever hope to persuade the int’l community to take meaningful action against #Turkey.
