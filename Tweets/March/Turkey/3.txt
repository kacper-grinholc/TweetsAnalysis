#TurkishBayraktar TB-2s, now in Ukraine are #Erdoğan's weapon of choice against peaceful #Kurdish, #Yezidi and #Armenian communities who stood in the way of the expansionist ambitions of #NATO member #Turkey.

The Turkish gov't has previously denied its participation in systematically wiping out the Armenian people over 100 years ago. #ArmenianGenocide  Today, #Turkey is aiding the #Ethiopia|n gov in systematically wiping out the #Tigray|an people. #TigrayGenocide #TurkeyDroneSale
Genocide is nothing new for #Turkey.  The #ArmenianGenocide is real, and now the Turkish government is insistent on supporting the #TigrayGenocide at the behest of @AbiyAhmedAli. #TurkeyDroneSale
.@PowerUSAID traveled to #Ethiopia “to end attempts at collective punishment of the Tigrayans” Instead, @AbiyAhmedAli refused to meet with her and went to #Turkey to arrange the delivery of drones for #Ethiopia|n forces to use against #Tigray|ans. 
#Turkey has offered to mediate between #Ethiopia and #Sudan regarding the #TigrayGenocide while supplying #Ethiopia with drones. #TurkeyDroneSale

🇹🇷 #Turkey  Turkey's annual inflation rate increased to 54.44 percent in February, the highest level since 2002, according to the Turkish Statistical Institute. Consumer prices in the country rose 4.81 percent month over month in February, according to the data. 
Turks are enraged that the government is still keeping the ban on music past midnight in place, despite lifting many of the COVID-19-related measures. #Turkey 
Just south of events in Ukraine, #Israel's President Isaac #Herzog will be visiting #Turkey's Recep Tayyip #Erdoğan, the first such meeting in 15 years. But there is much reason to doubt significant Turkish-Israeli rapprochement. My latest for @FPRI: 
A few maps to ponder. If #Turkey helps #Turkic neighbours secede from #Russia , the #RussianUkrainianWar could get very interesting.  #Ukraine is not the end of #Putins ambitions. 
@YourAnonNews Don't lie to yourself. The only ones supporting #Ukraine with havy weapons are #Turkey Poland and England...  Where is the Flagg from Turkey?

.@SonerCagaptay: Potential opening for improving U.S.-#Turkey ties including cooperation in #Ukraine; #Ankara nixing the S-400 deal; #Washington inviting Turkey back to the F35 project; and Congress approving F-16 sales to #Ankara. #TWIPolicyForum
To, My Muslim Friends from #Turkey,

#saudi crown prince #MBS is playing with fire. He known he has a dirty page on his resume in #Turkey, that the #US can play anytime against him. The name #khashoggi rings the bell. 
.@SonerCagaptay: Anti-refugee sentiments in #Turkey are rising, mainly due to the country's economic crisis, and #Erdogan would not be able to counter the political trends triggered by a sudden and overwhelming increase in #Turkey’s refugee population. #TWIPolicyForum
#Turkey, a #NATO member:   ▫️ blames the #West for #Ukraine #Russia war  ▫️says those who trust NATO &amp; the #US should take lessons ▫️claims #Turkey stands in safety because it decided to go solo and didn't cooperate with #US &amp; #Europe.  via ⇢ @abdbozkurt 
Well done #Turkey 
In times of war, #Turkey may prohibit the transit of certain warships through the Turkish Straits. How has Turkey implemented the #MontreuxConvention in #RussiaUkraineConflict? Prof. Pete Pedrozo @StocktonCenter @NavalWarCollege explains. #UkraineSymposium
After nude models working for Hacettepe University's Faculty of Fine Arts were dismissed from the university, a group of students protested the decision at the campus. #Turkey
