There are reasons President Erdogan would do that and, yet, he seems to stay in the middle between Ukraine and Russia. Transferring S-400 to Ukraine would be only a gain for Turkey, Ukraine and NATO, but he really willing to do this? I remain skeptical. #Turkey #Ukraine

Spring 2014-Fighting Begins in Ukraine-Tension in the West  via @ElizabethSurin1  Read RT   #Ukraine #Poland #Turkey #HistoryMatters
MY SOLARIS skipped the the last "turn" towards the Bosphorus / Black Sea and now it is almost surely headed for a port in #Turkey, Fethiye and Gocek seem the most likely candidates at the moment. 
What's going to happen in the battlefield in the next 2 weeks is going to be a big factor. Hope &amp; pray the talks work 🙏🤞  #Ukraine - #Russia peace deal ‘close’, says #Turkey despite western scepticism | #UkraineWar 
@GoGoGokkhan @irinatsukerman_ I don’t think #Erdogan has the courage to do so besides the agreement does not allow #Turkey to do so!
#Turkey has condemned the #drone and #rocket attacks on multiple locations in #SaudiArabia on Sunday. 
Michael IV Autoreianos was appointed Ecumenical Patriarch of #Constantinople OTD in 1206  #travel #Turkey #history
#Russia-#Ukraine war: #Turkey says Moscow and Kyiv 'close to agreement' 
In other belated news, this is very important considering the geopolitics of #Turkey and #Armenia. The map is being redrawn and new alliances are forming:   
After snub from Poland,Uncle with XXXL diapers @JoeBiden now want #Turkey to get into confrontation with #Russia by asking it to give their S400 to #Ukraine  #USA with most modern army always bomb only helpless civilian before running away without pants as in Vietnam, Afghanistan
#SevereWeather 📹 Astronomical winter ends with heavy snowfall in northern #Turkey.  In the last few hours, snow ❄️ has fallen with intensity and persistence, even at sea level. 
Maybe I am naive, but I remember our @StateDept  friends using the word "intervention" for describing #Turkey's military invasion and continuous occupation of the Republic of #Cyprus, an EU member state.  The U.S. should do, and can do better than #China!! 
That`s just superb!  #ayvalkbadavuttabipark #turkey #dome 
Main opposition leader calls for referendum on citizenship for #refugees  #Turkey
Sorry but Turkey is far more democratic in many aspects compared to Europe. I do not think #hezbollah can do any demonstration in any european country but today #PKK a world wide accepted terrorist organisation did a seperatist demonstration in #izmir #Turkey.
Watch the brutality in #Adana #Turkey to know the reality of #Erdogan ‘s regime.  #AdanaEmniyeti

#Turkey on Sunday said #Russia and #Ukraine made progress on their #negotiations to halt the #invasion and the two warring sides were close to an #agreement. 
Interesting! I’m watching the Batman at a cinema. It runs for 90 mins and is suddenly cut off for the intermission. When was the last time you had a movie intermission. #Istanbul #Turkey
#ICYMI: On our latest podcast episode @LiselHintz explains the many reasons why a recent suggestion that #Turkey transfer its Russian-made S400 missile system to #Ukraine won't happen. Listen here ⬇️ 
Wishing you a happy, healthy, and prosperous #Nowruz! May every day of the new year glow with cheer and joy. #Iran #Afghanistan #Azerbaijan #Turkey #Uzbekistan #Tajikistan #Kyrgyzstan #Turkmenistan 
@worldonalert @_JakubJanda I assume Germany has not enough ATGM, Stingers, Panzerfaust and so on to fight Russia headon.  But I would argue it is of strategically better use to spam #Ukraine with the few they have.   They should produce/order more, like license build #BayraktarTB2  and #Akinci.  #Turkey
