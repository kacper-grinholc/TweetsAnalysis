For some analysts, #Turkey's position is clearer than it might seem. "Turkey is actually not balancing between #Russia and #Ukraine. Turkey is actively supporting Ukraine and pivoting away from Russia," @OzgurHisarcikli of the German Marshall Fund tells @AFP
The U.S. didn't provide MQ-9s to #Ukraine.  #Turkey provided its state-of-the-art Bayraktar TB2s to Ukraine without a hesitation.  Tell me which country is fighting against #Russia?
To keep #ukranian troops from defending the south ? So #putin can take #Moldavië  #odessa #marioepol and #charkov . Block ukrain from the #blacksea  next #turkey #bosporus 
#Turkey's President Recep Tayyip #Erdoğan and British Prime Minister Boris #Johnson continue to put efforts into achieving a #ceasefire in the Russian-Ukrainian war.

@Andy_Scollick yes, what's the problem with that? #Turkey (a #NATO member) downed multiple official #Russia aircrafts in #Syria, like a fighter in 2015 and there was no #WW3  Russian airstrikes destroyed #Borodyanka and other towns, few dead #Russia pilots are better than dozens dead civilians

@Erkinalp11 This is an inaccurate and incorrect quote, taken completely out of context by you and the #Turkish side. The invasion of #Cyprus was not legal, the occupation is illegal, and no country other than #Turkey recognizes the ##TRNC for these reasons. Stop the propaganda.
