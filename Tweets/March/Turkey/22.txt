“🇹🇷#Turkey is able to determine its own policy and path, it has always been like this.” Washington recommended that Ankara send the🇷🇺#Russia n S-400 air defense systems available to Turkey to 🇺🇦#Ukraine  That would have been enough to overthrow #Putin OR lead to a nuclear strike. 
#Turkey should never be allowed to join the #EU after they rejected the sanctions on #Russia essentially helping them and standing for Russia against their own @nato partners. U can’t be for both sides. They need to make clear where they stand. #StandWithUkraine
@ariel_oseran @AlsisiOfficial @IsraeliPM @MohamedBinZayed @i24NEWS_EN Not so hard to see. Assad was already in covert conversations w Israel prior to 2011 uprisings.
