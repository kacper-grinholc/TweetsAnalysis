@amnestyusa #Isra√´l people is the indiginous people of #Isra√´l and @amnesty must respect it and stop perpetuating #antis√©mitisme  discrimination and insults against it. #ShameOnYou
#Anonymous #GhostClan takes out #Israel Government websites in what was called a ‚Äòwide-scale‚Äô attack, perhaps the biggest in Israel‚Äôs history as they undermine #Ukraines offensive capabilities #UkraineÔ∏è #Russia

#Palestine: #Israel expands settlement to further isolate Jerusalem 
Another scandal coming from #Israel @USAmbIsrael @IsraelMFA. The #Ukraine war reveals the true colors of countries. Israel has miserably failed in the test. 
If this issue were reversed and #Ukraine was blocking Israel from spyware that might help in protecting the country, America politicians would be in an uproar.    --&gt;#Israel, Fearing Russian Reaction, Blocked Spyware for Ukraine and Estonia

Winner of the 2022 Prize for Bizarre Orwellian Logic goes to ‚Å¶@MESA_1966‚Å© president: ‚ÄúMESA's Board will ensure the call for an academic boycott [of #Israel] is upheld without undermining our commitment to the free exchange of ideas &amp; scholarship.‚Äù  
Add to that by the way that whenever Syria was winning against #ISIS terrorists #Israel would fly its jets over to bomb the Syrian army but leave ISIS intact. They never ever bombed ISIS terrorists who were near Israeli border 
#Israel blocked #Ukraine from buying NSO Group‚Äôs #Pegasus spyware for fear that #Russian officials would be angered by the sale of the sophisticated hacking tool #Russia @AnonOpsSE #Anonymous

Leaders of UAE, Israel and Egypt met recently. The 3 amigos, or better known as the beneficiaries of the Empire.  They are worried Big brother doesn't have their backs. #Egypt #Israel #UAE #AmericaFirst
Raef #Zreik: The same holds for the recent refugees from #Ukraine. Their tragic plight is being manipulated by the State of #Israel, which, in providing them a safe refuge, is simultaneously deploying them in the struggle over the land.  
#Israel blocked #Ukraine and #Estonia in recent years from using powerful spyware to hack #Russian phones, fearing the Kremlin‚Äôs reaction 
@vilo103 @nixknameee @ragipsoylu @oryxspioenkop @POTUS @JRubinBlogger @TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC @chrislhayes Of course, LAST THING I would ever want is the destruction of Israel.  If kowtowing to #WarCriminalPutin is #Israel‚Äôs best interest, then I‚Äôll hold my nose (&amp; tongue) bc, yes, I‚Äôm NOT there &amp; NOT an expert in warfare.  But, being hostage to/blackmailed by Putin is NOT a good look
The world is now seeing #Israel true colors.  Israel is Palestinians‚Äô Russia. The aggressor. For almost 74 years.  #BoycottIsrael  #FreePalestine  #SlavaUkrainii 
After 5 days in #dubai I don't know how I can go back living like a normal civilian, I felt like a fking queen! Everywhere I go is "hello ma'am let me carry your bag ma'am good day ma'am I open the door for you ma'am"! In #Israel the best I get is "yalla yalla ufi mipo geveret"

#Israel is number 9! For a country that was established after the tragedy of the Holocaust &amp; many wars, as an immigrant, I found Israelis to be remarkably optimistic &amp; positive. So full of life &amp; energy. Just don't ask them to say please &amp;/ tnx! üòâ
