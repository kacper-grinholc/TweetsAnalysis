So if the story about Bennett's support for #Putin is true and he tried to pressure @ZelenskyyUa into accepting conditions that would strengthen #Russia, he was acting against #Israel's own security interests.
Why that's likely to work - #Russia has already started pulling out its forces from #Syria to send to #Ukraine. The weaker #Russia is in #SYria, the less it can dictate ROE to #Israel on #Iran targets. It's the same country that's building #Iran's nuclear reactor.
It's not in #Israel's interests to prop up #Putin at this time. In fact, #Israel has a good opportunity to work with #Turkey &amp; capitalize on #Russia's current weakness in #Syria. #Erdogan is not trustworthy, but minimizing #Russia's presence in #Syria is in his interests.

Today we visited Caesarea Philippi and read from the Scriptures in Matthew Chapter 16 Verses 13-20 as we viewed the traditional location of the Gates of Hell.   We also visited the Lebanon and Syrian border near Mount Hermon and finished the day in Capernaum.   #travel #Israel 
Paul O‚ÄôBrien is a bigoted, clueless asshole. #Israel will never give in to terrorists or hateful propagandists. #Zionists outnumber and are stronger in their devotion than the ones who want to destroy us.  #IsraelLives. @amnesty @AmnestyUK @amnestyusa #WeStandWithIsrael üáÆüá±üíô‚ú°Ô∏èüáÆüá±  
If I were in charge of the Democratic Party's national platform, I'd remove support for #Israel POSTHASTE.   You might actually even win the midterms if you do.  These are terrible times, times of mourning; this time the death nail of democracy in Israel. #naftalibennett 
Or not.. It seems #NaftaliBennett has decided which side his bread is buttered on.. #Ukraine #Israel 
Wut?   "#Israel asked #Ukraine not to request more military and defense aid because such a request could harm the mediation efforts." 
@LuisMorenolg Nothing short of disgraceful. Let‚Äôs remember that the next time Israel hyperventilates over rockets fired by Hamas. #Israel #RussiaInvadedUkraine
dear Jews would you be willing to accept Hitlers peace rules in WW 2 ?  Pleas dont make the people rethinking the holocaust.  React as you would like world reacted in  39. #Israel
#Ukraine #Russia - Israel's P.M. @NaftaliBennett after meeting w/#VladimirPutin (butcher of Ukraine) &amp; partner of #Israel's worst enemy #BasharAlAssad, told Ukrainian President #VolodymyrZelensky yield before Russia's demands! Surprising the #Mossad let him be fooled by Putin! ü§î 
"The only democracy in the Middle East" is no democracy if its Prime Minister sides with #Putler. #Israel  #NaftaliBennett, you've sold your neshama. 
Fuck Israel, why do they side with tyrants now? Why are their spies the point people for global fascism? #israel 
PIA United condemns @amnestyusa ED Paul O'Brien's comments. Saying that he believes in self-determination, just not for Jews, is outrageous; calling for the end of #Israel as the world‚Äôs only Jewish state is repulsive. 
Hey @TwitterComms what‚Äôs wrong with you ? üò≥üò≥  How comes you promote with an added symbol the "boycott of #Israel"  What about your struggle against "hate policies" ? ‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è

When #Syrians went out to topple the sectarian oppressive regime, #Putin was allowed &amp; supported by the #West to fiercely put out their resistance calling it #Islamic terror that will threaten #Israel.  Putin attacks #Ukraine, now he's called Syria's #Shiite minority to his war!
It should be noted that #Israel needs #Russia (Syria, Iran, UNSC...), but doesn't really need #Ukraine.  If Bennett can help deliver a Ukrainian surrender, Putin might reward that at some point. #Zelensky 
@VeikoSpolitis @IlvesToomas @IsraeliPM @ZelenskyyUa I'm shocked and outraged. Would @IsraeliPM sacrifice his own country and ppl just to achieve peace with a genocidal enemy that has invaded one's country? #Israel #StopPutin #StopRussia #SaveUkraine
RT @senrobportman: Proud that the #Israel Relations Normalization Act I co-authored with @CoryBooker, @SenatorRisch, @SenatorCardin &amp; @SenToddYoung was included in the FY 2022 bipartisan funding agreement &amp; is now ready to become law.

@BarakRavid @axios Seems that #Israel is supporting #Genocide against #Ukraine! Or what?!
@BarakRavid @axios Isarels Prime Minister Bennett should take some history lessons on jews history. He might be surprised to find similarities with Ukraine. Or not. Shame on #Israel
Israeli prime minister 'wants us to surrender', says senior Ukrainian official.  #Ukraine #War #Russia #Israel
I mean Netanyahu stood with the American #whitesupremacists, who were funded by Putin, so it ought not come as a shock that #Israel backs Putin in #Ukraine   If WW3 does go off, you'll see civil war in Israel over this. This is unconscionable. #NaftaliBennett 
#Bloomberg you are responsible for giving a non-military an expert a platform to spread misinformation and tarnish #Israel

üõë#Israel approves 730 new housing units in Occupied Jerusalem, also approved 2 other settlement plans, including 850 units on Jaffa Street near the Mahane Yehuda market &amp; 210 housing units in Kiryat Yearim illegal settlement, And Much more 
Thanks to Putin's war in Ukraine, #Israel may be forced to absorb around 100,000 people. Putin is an ASSHOLE! 
It appears that the Israeli government is preparing to legalize and regulate the relationship between banks and virtual currency service providers (VASPs).    #NFTExpoverse #NFT #crypo #cryptocurrency #israel #cryptonews
