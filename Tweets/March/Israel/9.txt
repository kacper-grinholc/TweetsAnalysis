It would take great convincing from the #US and #EU as well as assurances (or something in exchange) from #Israel.   As #Cyprus peace talks are in a stalemate &amp; there are thoughts about introducing CBMs, there's a chance that if this project proceeds beyond being just an idea &gt;
#Turkey-#Israel might get there, but they're not there yet.   It's however true that many actors might want to support such a project, such as the US &amp; EU. It serves Western interests, it'd be relatively cheap - cheaper, more feasible &amp; more competitive than #EastMed pipeline.&gt;
#Israel is pursuing similar objective and also, importantly, the change of #Turkey's stance vis-a-vis #Hamas. Whether that will materialize remains to be seen.  Now, with all the chaos around the #UkraineRussiaWar, what about this pipeline?
(including the #EastMed pipeline) or within the #EMFG (w the exception of course of #Egypt), #Turkey seemed to offer at least theoretically another option to reach #Europe. Thus a the idea of a #Turkey-#Israel - that was floating around early/mid-2010s - is back on the table.  &gt;
This was one of the core weakness that prevented the further deepening of #Israel's partnership with #Cyprus and #Greece. More on this here:   Moreover in the absence of any tangible results in #energy cooperation w #Cyprus and #Greece on exports &gt;&gt;
This change included efforts for - at least tactically - improved relations with #Israel, #Egypt, #Greece, #UAE, #KSA, #Armenia etc.  The new government in #Israel did not carry the baggage of the breakdown with #Turkey and therefore wasn't as invested in prolonging the stalemate
🧵On #Turkey-#Israel and talk of a #gas pipeline  After a tour in #Greece and #Cyprus, that aimed at appeasing their concerns, Israeli president was today visiting Turkey in the context of improving bilateral relations. Its the first visit by an Israeli president since 2008. &gt;
The #russianinvasion and the atrocities being committed against the people of #Ukraine️ is similar to what #Israel does against the #Palestinians . These #WarCrimes associated with bombing civilians are right out of the Israeli playbook. Absolutely disgusting

@DrHananAshrawi Maybe #israel wouldn't need to do this if your course materials didn't include frothy murderous ancient antisemitism
@MiddleEastEye You IDIOT almost all #Arab #Muslim countries bought and use #Pegasus #Israel
#Ukraine️ and #Israel are both independent sovereign countries being attacked, so I am confused when the #FreePalestine  movement is trying to compare "Palestinian resistance" to the Ukranians.. What am I missing here?
Heartwarming.   Our friends at Keren Kayemeth Le’Israel welcomed 100 Jewish Ukrainian orphans &amp; their caregivers to the Nes Harim Field &amp; Forest Education Center near Jerusalem.   They were greeted with open arms &amp; a special celebration in honor of their safe arrival in #Israel. 
@SabineSterk From what I've seen Israel may or not be "saying enough" but it's going above and beyond to help alleviate the suffering of Ukraine in practical terms. I know which I'd rather have if I was Ukrainian. #Israel 🇮🇱 ❤ #UkraineRussianWar
Hebrew sources: A senior source at the US Embassy in #Israel: We want to see all partners, especially #Israel, impose sanctions on #Russia.
Meanwhile, the love between #Turkey and #Israel 
@AbdullahNuriyya @RBoydBarrett Israel's cordial relations with KSA, UAE and now turkey flashes the Hadith into my mind in which Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) mentions signs of end of time where Muslims would be large in number and wealth. But, afraid of non believers due to disunity. #Israel #Turkey

As #Putin further limits democracy and the economy collapses under sanctions, many #Russian #Jews are inquiring about starting new lives in #Israel.
This will escalate  I expect #Iranian militia retaliation against #Israel directly in coming days from #Syria 
Every day, week, month and year Israel, illegally advances into Palestine. They invade, they shoot, they murder, they bomb innocent men, women and children.  The media never says a word. #Israel #Palestine #RussiaUkraineConflict #PalestineUnderAttack #Zionist #racism #SaudiArabia 
humanity in #Israel ... while they expile  the #Palestinians from their homes, they are offering shelters for the #Ukrainians Refugees 
@ltgrusselhonore @USArmy THIS “ #UkraineRussianWar ✈️deal discussed in media😞 For the record during a Israel conflict we took M60 Tanks from @USArmy Tank Battalion &amp; shipped overnight to #Israel Lesson: DON’T DISCUSS OPTIONS IN PRESS #putin DON’T MAKE THE RULES  #NATO #US get a pair”  cc: @POTUS
#Bahrain is a natural ally to #Israel on #Iran given its very reasonable concerns about being taken over by Tehran.

#Turkey and #Israel know it's much more profitable to cooperate than confront or compete with one another, @YusufErim34 tells i24NEWS, adds President Herzog's warm relationship with Erdogan makes him unique as a figure to jumpstart this relationship and normalization process

Dear Pakistanis, Don’t fall for Islamic quotes of politicians. Look at their policies and actual ground work. And never ever stand behind a politician who is willing to shake hands with #Israel. Betrayal to our oppressed brethren is betrayal to the Islamic world, the Ummah!
Head of #Cypriot Military Makes First Visit to #Israel:   “The head of #Cyprus’s military touched down in #Israel on Monday, kicking off his first official visit to the country, the #Israel Defense Forces announced on Tuesday.”
Seems like #Islam has spread again to the boundaries of #Israel and soon we will have no more #YahoodiSazish destroying out beloved #Pakistan. #Erdogan

I never thought I'd agree with anything #Zelenskyy says, but in this case, I must agree with him.. #israel and #Ukraine do indeed share some #Nazi characteristics.. Stand by for @zelenskyyUA to start handing out Swastika and SS banners to his troops.. Any minute now.. 👍 
#Israel’s president on #Turkey trip to ‘restart’ ties    Bilateral issues may dominate following more than a decade of diplomatic rupture
