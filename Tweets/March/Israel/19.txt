Classic circular reasoning. Groundlessly label a human rights group "terrorist", then complain when others don't give credence to your label. @HonestRepCanada #Israel #Palestine #cdnpoli 
Israel is only second to Russia DIRTY MONEY LAUNDERING in London.   @Keir_Starmer who supports #Israel without condition FAILS to DEMAND to STOP Israel Dirty Money Laundering in London. Racist #Labourparty #labourdoorstep #electionUK2022 
The world will face a much bigger crisis than #Ukraine if #Israel attacks the Iranian regime's nuclear facilities. The only way to prevent this nightmare is to maintain the current sanctions against the Iranian regime, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. #JCPOA

Is Erdogan's diplomatic surge around #RussianUkrainianWar connected to economic crisis, and 2023 elections?  Riffing on great reports by @amberinzaman @BenCaspit @fehimtastekin @PinarTremblay @mustfsnmz @NazlanEr  @AlMonitor #Turkey #Israel #Libya #Erdogan
The omnibus bill includes $4.8 billion to #Israel‚Äî$3.8 billion annual #military funding, and an additional $1 billion for #IronDome weapons protection from rocks thrown by #Palestine.   #Ukraine gets a measly $2 billion to fight #russianinvasion #bombs, #tanks, soldiers. Huh?

Antizionism is the only political movement where people exclusively define themselves by hating something and wanting to see it destroyed. It is not about a specific policy change, or affirming human life, but about eliminating a country from the map. . . . #israel #zionism 
@JimDMaynard @sidali707 @jjz1600 Your profile says "humanist". Apparently your humanism doesn't apply to Palestinians. You keep spewing the revisionist Zionist talking points. If #Palestine was invented by the Arab states after creation of #Israel then why did the British call it Mandatory Palestine? So go
