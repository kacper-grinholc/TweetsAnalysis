#BREAKING #NOW  An American official confirms the attack on the American base at #Erbil airport and that there have been no casualties so far. #USA #Biden #Iraq #PMU #Iran #IRGC #Israel #IDF  
IRGC-affiliated Fars News cites Iraqi Sabereen News claiming that the targets in tonight‚Äòs missile strike in #Erbil were‚Äútwo advanved training centers belonging to #Israel‚Äôs Mossad‚Äú‚Ä¶ 
After proving the source of the missiles - Iran  .  American fighters take off - is it possible to hit a target inside Iran?  #Tehran #Erbil  #Damascus #Israel #RussianArmy #UkraineWar #Ukraine #Iran #Syria
As i reported earlier the attack in #Erbil was directed towards #Israel not #US 
#Israel Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he recommends #Ukraine to surrender to #Russia  via ‚Å¶@Jerusalem_Post‚Å©   
According to the announcement of #SabreenNews near the Revolutionary Guards, the two developed #Israel #Mossad training center in #Erbil city claimed to be shot with ballistic missiles.
@GiganteAdamast2 Nothing, just saying. Btw, Middle East's most demon-cratic and #apartheid state #Israel  is NOT a signatory of Biological Weapon Convention (BWC). So, technically they have kind of free pass.
Top government officials from #Turkey and #Israel on Saturday¬†expressed willingness to cooperate on natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean amid ongoing¬†efforts between the countries towards rapprochement.  via @ahval_en 
Note -- on Wednesday, x2 #IRGC officers were killed in an #Israel airstrike in #Syria -- their funerals were attended by senior #IRGC leadership.  #Iran has retaliated against #Israel strikes by hitting U.S. targets before, but not by launching missiles *from* #Iran.

@MullieSteven @GeromanAT Who do you think gives #Israel the weapons to attack #Syria? Who do you think allows Israel to spoof their jets?
It's pretty stunning to contemplate that #Israel might be the site of peace talks for arguably the most significant world crisis since WW2. "Russia open to Ukraine negotiations in Jerusalem" 
This is likely part of the negotiation process with #Israel. Right now #Turkey needs #Israel &amp; Western countries a lot more than #Hamas heads. However, this may change after #Erdogan's elections next year. In the past, Hamas leaders had been kicked out, then returned.

30% of the amount of US aid paid to #Israel annually. 
Another thought: during a similar incident in October 2021 when #Iran's militias attacked U.S. forces for an Israeli strike in #Syria, the calculation was the U.S. would not respond whereas #Israel would. Fast forward to tonight, that likely is a similar calculation. 2/2
As we await details on the attack in #Erbil tonight, would note this photo from the memorial for the two members of #Iran's IRGC who were killed in the strike by #Israel on #Syria days ago. Their deaths brought out top IRGC brass: Hossein Salami &amp; Amir Ali Hajizadeh. 1/2 
So #Iran attacks U.S Consulate in #Erbil #Iraq in retaliation of #Israel attack that killed 2 Iranians?! Is this an invitation for another war in #MiddleEast?!
The strikes in #Erbil are #Iranian retaliatory strikes via proxy to #Israel's killing of IRGC agents in Syria a few days ago. Iran won't hit Israel directly unless it is a response to attacks on their nuclear sites.
Few days back #Israel targeted #Iranian backed militants position in #Syria killing 2 #IRGC members .  There is high possibility that #Iran retaliated to those airstrike .  This ios known fact that #Israel's mossad is active in Erbil
@Billbrowder Are the Russian Oligarchs‚Ä¶..going home to Israel? Shameful!#israel
I highly doubt the missiles came from Iran directly but the #US and #Israel have been attacking Iranian‚Äôs in #Syria for some time now without any response, I guess they got some response now. #iraq #ERBIL 
@TerrySzuplat @SarahKSilverman @McFaul 100% agreed and why stop there what about another tyrant #Israel in the #Palestine  And #India in #kashmir or other regions of the world..
