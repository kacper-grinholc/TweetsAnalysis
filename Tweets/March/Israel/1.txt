Some NATO countries as well as #India and #Israel have conducted false flags to justify their actions against their enemies. It is very much possible that NATO conducts a false flag to justify a full attack on #Russia  #PutinWarCriminal #UkraineRussiaWar #Ukraine #Kharkiv
Yes, please, stop the war in Palestine. This is what your country can do #Israel #war 
@swepal2 And #Israel has “secret” plans to evacuate a couple hundred Thousand more Jews, frm #Ukraine to Displace more #Palestinians, steal more Palestinian land and maintain the demographic status quo. ( to maintain its apartheid)
Dear @UN, @congressdotgov &amp; @CNN, sorry this #Palestinian girl isn't blue eyed &amp; blond but many of you aren't either BUT YOU did give #israel the funds to beat her...you will always cover #israelicrimes. #CNN #UkraineRussiaWar  #UkraineUnderAttack
Aliyah is the best option for Ukraine's Jewish community.    #BH #USA #Israel #Ukraine #Aliyah #Jewish #tdot #tcot #jcot #tt
@StateDeptSpox Yes, #Russia is doing humanitarian destruction in #Ukraine. As seen in the picture, like the destruction #Israel has done in #Palestine for years. 
#Israel is one of my favorite places on Earth. Yes. I absolutely love Israel and her magnificent people. Against the chaos in #Ukraine, please remember - Israel is less than a two hour flight away. #NoWar #Peace ❤️  
The ambiguous attitude of #Israel and the #UAE (which abstained at the UNSC when asked to condemn Moscow's war) towards Russia's invasion of #Ukraine will probably have few/no consequences for both countries' relations with the US. And they know it. 
How do you know you are right?! When you have people like @IlhanMN , a US Congress member, against you. Watching and listening to her, you know #Israel as well as #Ukraine is doing the right thing!🇺🇦🇮🇱 
Hello @NATO ! Sanctions on #Israel ? 
@Israel #Israel, Ukrainians need the #IronDome to be brought to #Ukraine to #shelteroursky, cause we die here. We need help. Please, in glory of all the victims of nazi regime
@MASHAVisrael @Israel @EynatShlein @IsraelMFA @TSchwarzbard @IsraelinUkraine #Israel, Ukrainians need the #IronDome to be brought to #Ukraine to #shelteroursky, cause we die here. We need help. Please, in glory of all the victims of nazi regime
WHERE IS #ISRAEL in PUTIN’s WAR against UKRAINE ?
South Korea is an aggressor nation.  #Israel #Palestrina #SouthAfrica #Kenya #Africa
And where is #israel on all this?  Turning a blind eye. First they came for the Ukrainians, but I wasn’t Ukrainian…… 
@Israel We need #Israel to bring the #IronDome to #Ukraine to #shelteroursky, cause we die here. We need help. Please, in glory of all the victims of nazi regime
For Israel 🇮🇱 it was Saddam Hussein🇮🇶💪🏻.. And now for anti Israel aka Ukraine 🇺🇦.. it is Vladimir Putin 🇷🇺💪🏻.. #UkraineRussiaWar #UkraineUnderAttack #Israel #FreePalestine #SaddamHussein #Russian #Russia #RussianArmy #Iraq 
Three Palestinian young man was murdered by Israeli occupation forces in less than 24 hours #Israel's occupation forces executed a young man at the entrance to the town of Beit Fajar namaz in salah Bethlehem. #UkraineInvasion #FreePalestine #IsraeliCrimes #savepalestine 
@LadyVelvet_HFQ That’s is how the world is, No one sees the atrocities done on Muslims and the Muslim world but all the other issues are very heartbreaking. Astonishingly #Israel condemns war, this is like: really?
#Ukraine is not asking for the #IronDome since it won't work against the bigger missiles the Russions use says Ukraine's ambassador to #Israel 
How about a sporting boycott of #israel ...?  Sanctions are neither new nor guaranteed to be effective – just look at Cuba 
The REAL work #Israel 🇮🇱 does ... ALL in the name of Hashem ... Not for money , not for benefits , or friendships. SOLELY because it is the right thing we are meant and called to do.  ✌️🤟🖖 💖💗💖 
@proto_modecule @IsraelMFA It's incredible. Everything about this war has ominous echoes of 1939. How can #Israel not be sensitive to that on behalf of others? Caring only about their own citizens is not good enough.
HE IS CALLED THE SON OF PERDITION FOR A REASON, HE WILL DESTROY WONDERFULLY WHEN HE ASCENDS FROM THE BOTTOMLESS PIT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE UPCOMING 70TH WEEK AND ENTER THE BODY OF MBS 42 MONTHS AFTER HE CONFIRMS THE COVENANT WITH #ISRAEL TO START THE FINAL WEEK. GET YOUR SOUL RIGHT
