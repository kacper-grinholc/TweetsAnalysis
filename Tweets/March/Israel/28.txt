Some regional experts have echoed Al-Wefaq’s concerns, asserting that the ultimate objective of the normalization deals between #Israel &amp; the #Arabs is the formation of a hostile axis against #Iran.
#Bahrain’s opposition Al-Wefaq movement described the gathering of top diplomats from #Israel, the #US, &amp; four #Arab countries, as "an assault on the sovereignty of all Arab and #Islamic states." 
Needless to add by now, the "hero" #Zelenskyy's monologue to the Knesset wasn't well-received. Far from it.  And this, in spite of innumerable attempts by him &amp; other Ukrainians of various strata sucking-up to #Isrāel.  Mr @philsphizer rationalizes ‘why’:
Interesting story by Jerusalem Post: #Iran struck #Iraq target over #gas talks involving #Israel -officials    #Kurdistan 's proven gas reserves are at 25 trillion cubic feet (tcf)=707,92 bcm = the quantity of 4.5 years, that the #EU imports from #Russia

#Israel hosted, foreign ministers from the #UAE, #Egypt, #Bahrain, #Morocco and the #US at a desert retreat in the #Negev. Will the summit begin a new era in Arab-Israel relations?  Is US dominance in #WestAsia coming to an end?  #UkraineWar #Iran #GULF
@salar_seyf If the leadership of #Baku embracrs #Iran and stops following the whispers of #israel and #turkey, Armenians of #Karabakh can live in peace and harmony with their Iranian/Azeri neighbors just like in Iran we live and share and recpect each other and have done that for centuries
Witj Israel hosting foreign ministers from the UAE, Egypt, Bahrain, Morocco and the US at a desert retreat in the Negev, what do you think should dominate their discussions?  #Israel #summit #Arab

How is it that everything here is labeled -- every fruit, every food, but dates don't have labels? #Israel #bds #freepalestine #Ramadan
Trying to buy dates for Ramadan in the US is so hard -- the medjoul dates are from Israel, but not labeled. They have deceptive names like "Jordan River" and "La Palmas" but are from the Palestinian territories #Israel #bds #freepalestine #Ramadan

The Seder massacre, was a suicide bombing attack carried out by #Palestinian terrorists from the Hamas terrorist organization at the Park Hotel in #Netanya on the night of the Seder, March 27, 2002.  In the attack, 30 people were killed and 160 were injured. #israel #NeverForget 
The message of unity which comes form the #Negev_Summit is welcoming &amp; powerful but the Palestinian people thing otherwise. Is it a “free reward to Israel” as they say? Do these normalisation meetings legalise what the #Israel has done or it is still doing to the Palestinians?
