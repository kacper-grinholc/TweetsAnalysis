One of the victims murdered in today’s #Terrorist attack in #Israel 
Four people were killed on Tuesday by an alleged #Arab #assailant who was later shot dead by a passerby in #Israel's southern city of #Beersheba, Israeli police said. 
ACTS 9-12: more Acts of Peter   #History of #faith in #Jesus #Christ continues in #Acts with Peter #healing a #paralyzed man as he travels through #Israel. These powerful signs from #God accompany the true #Apostle.
Most of the #Gaza Strip's population are still deprived of access to potable water due to #Israel's control over water sources and regular bombardment of water networks and wells. Previous oral statement before #HRC:    #WorldWaterDay
heartbroken. This is Doris Yahbas (in the red dress) one of the two Israeli women that together with two other men  were murdered today in one of the worst terror attacks in #Israel in recent years with a total of 4 dead and 2 critically wounded.   . זכרונה לברכה 
In my opinion, in the coming period we will witness reciprocal visits between #UAE and Iranian officials, as #Israel may reduce its strikes within #Syria, while some financial support might be announced for #Egypt which is suffering, to ward off any popular anger. 9/9 
#Russia file: In light of the Western economic war on Russia, Abu Dhabi began to intensify its contacts with Moscow and the oligarchs there, so that Dubai would be an escape window from sanctions and money laundering. For this to happen, the #UAE will need #Israel's support. 7/9 
TW shootings⚠️ 4 humans were murdered today. 2 women were injured. 4 families lost their loved ones today because of this monster. Thanks god those civilians or should i say heroes were there to stop the monster. #terror #Israel 
The Israel National Cyber Directorate called on citizens to take greater steps to protect their privacy after revealing tens of thousands of CCTV units in the state are using a default password, leaving the cameras vulnerable to hacks.  #INCD | #Israel 
4 innocent human beings are dead murdered by a terrorist because they are Israelis and look at the replies to LTs tweet. Despite the regularity it never ceases to amaze me just how some people can be soulless and devoid of morality on here. #Israel 
@william_haggis A good question.   The UNSC needs reform, but who would have the authority to agree such such a measure?  In terms of military power #Turkey’s a big player, so are #India, #Israel, #Pakistan, #SaudiArabia, #Iran and #Canada, #EU - to mention a few.  Quite a bag of worms really.

It is not the first time that #Israel opens a political channel with #Iran. Oman used to be the mediator in the past but currently is Abu Dhabi. Therefore, Bennett through this summit might give a green light to Mohammed bin Zayed to activate this channel. 6/9 
One of the victims of today's terror attack in Be'er Sheva, southern #Israel was named as 49-year-old Doris Yahbas, a mother of 3 and a resident of Moshav Gilat. Our hearts go out to her loved ones at this tragic time. May her memory forever be a blessing. 🕯️ 
After #Biden removed the Houthis and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard from the US terrorist lists, this means a signal to the #Syrians #Saudis #Emiratis and #Israel that the season of terrorism is open to target you at any time   Biden has become the biggest supporter of terrorism 
Abu Dhabi believes that it can play the role of mediator between #Assad and his supporter, #Iran on the one hand, and #Israel on the other, and try to reduce the danger and tension on the Syrian-Israeli borders. 3/9 
If you support the #FreePalestine movement, you support terrorism. These cowards attack soft targets. It's no surprise that the Palestinian Authority, #Hamas et al support Russian terrorists who are attacking civilians in #Ukraine. Disgusting. #Israel #Beersheva 
Reconciliation moves b/w #Turkey and #Israel have boosted hopes that the flow of Israeli tourists to Turkey could be revived and increased @hazardost

@USAmbIsrael #Israel is stepping up to help #Ukraine like very few other countries are.  Imagine how this could make a much bigger difference if other countries would join these efforts. For example, #Qatar who has succeeded in helping other countries in hard times as well.
