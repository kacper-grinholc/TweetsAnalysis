#BREAKING US State Dept issues readout of Sec State #AntonyBlinken's meeting today in #Riga, #Latvia, with #Israel's foreign minister / alternate prime minister, Yair Lapid, re: multiple topics, incl. #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine as well as #Iran.  #Putin #Zelensky 
EXPLAINER: Why #Israel is #mediating between #Russia, #Ukraine. 
But I thought America was standing with #Ukraine?  How does #Israel feel about the Ukrainian nazis? 
Secretary Blinken’s Meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister and Alternate Prime Minister Lapid Washington, DC ( The US Department of State released the following statement:  Secretary of State Antony J.  #AntonyJBlinken #israel   
Pure evil for hate's sake - #Palestinians #Jerusalem #Israel #terror 👇 
H.E MR PM 🇵🇰 #ImranKhan must ask Mr @CharlesMichel about his past &amp; current role &amp; efforts in resolving decades old #Palestine &amp; #Kashmir conflicts! President European Council is required to tell us that wht action has been taken by #EU against Terror Sponsoring #israel &amp; #india. 
Compare what #Russia suffered in seven days of occupation of #Ukraine with what #Israel suffered in 70 years of occupation of #Palestine and parts of #Syria and #Lebanon. You will see that the #West is doing very badly. He has no #credibility. He is naked. #Gaza  #NATO  #Zelensky 
Note the opportunistic action during #UkraineRussianWar. #Israel continues to strike Syria, #NorthKorea continues to fire missiles, China ramp-up war prep to get back Tawain, US talking to Venezuela, US-Russia back chat on #IranNuclearDeal
State media in #Syria said #Israel-i missile strikes killed two civilians early Monday near the capital #Damascus, although a war monitor said the victims were pro-#Iran fighters
#Ukraine Prods #Israel on Aid but Grateful for #Moscow Mediation Bid 
By doing so, they will lose to #Russia the war won by the #US &amp; #UK.  #Israel, #Germany and several Russian #oligarchs are sacrificing #Ukraine. 
"#Israel could expect to see the arrival of a total of 15,000 #Ukrainians by the end of the month if it continues to allow entry to #refugees fleeing their war-torn country at the current pace, Interior Minister @Ayelet__Shaked told the Cabinet." 
2020 was cancelled. 2021 was cancelled. 2022 HERE WE GO!!!  Can’t wait to be in #Israel with this crew from @trinitychurchok !!!  🙏 
Those guys just killed last 24 hours in #Palestine #Jerusalem not for any thing other than there land occupied 70 years ago by #Israel. Why can’t we see some tear’s like what’s happening in #Ukraine️ ?? 
#Israel reports first #polio case since 1989: 
#Israel police said a #Palestinian who stabbed and wounded two officers Monday in #Jerusalem's annexed Old City was shot dead by forces. The attack and death comes a day after two Palestinians were killed in separate assaults on Israeli security personnel.
I support #Ukraine but I also wonder why we don’t support #Palestine who has been under attack for a very long time.  Same story, different skin tone I guess.  #ApartheidIsrael #Israel #FreePalestine #FreeUkraine
The Russian embassy in #Israel reportedly sent a message to the Foreign Ministry stating they were "very disappointed" with the Jewish state's condemnation of #Russia at the United Nations.  
@BernieSanders #Israel bombing #Syria #SyriaUnderAttack  #SaudiArabia bombing #Yemen #YemenUnderAttack #YemenGenocide #IsraeliApartheid #PalestineUnderAttack   Your position on these?
I was just waiting when the pro-Russia media starts to do the trolling! Of course the topic is #Israel. #Putin is fighting a nazi regime in Ukraine…who has a Jewish president!? And there are people who compare Israel with Russia and Ukraine is asking Israel for help! @guardian 
Israel hasn't committed any war crimes #duh #Israel #facts #US

@theIMEU Israel hasn't committed any war crimes #duh #Israel
#Israel-is has been a great family to be a part of since day one. Today we gathered with #Ukrainian citizens to share their stories and their feelings. Thank you Israel-is for caring about humanity in the first place! 🇮🇱 🇺🇦 @EyalBiram @malcolmgreen

SectyState #Blinken met w/ #Israel On Mon, re #Ukraine &amp; #IranNuclearDeal. Israel seeks #sanction relief for #Russia as condition to align w/ US re (1) Iran &amp; (2) Ukraine, now mindful of #USBombers “buzzing” it in ‘14 to protect Iran under Obama/Biden.
