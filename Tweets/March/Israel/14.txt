Iran Warns Iraq Against Threats From Iraqi Soil Missile strike a response to recent Israeli sabotage by Jason Ditz @jasonditz #Iran #Iraq #Israel #Tabriz   
@Israel: “We are not an #apartheid state! To say so is #AntiSemitic!”  Also #Israel: “It is now against the law to have #Palestinian spouses. They’re a threat to our national security! We must preserve our #Jewish character!”  Make it make sense.
Welcome to Israel #israel #Ukraine 
"CONFIRMED: #Israel to establish field hospital in #Ukraine.   Will contain emergency ward and focus on immediate aid to refugees.   Operation to be called ‘Kochav Meir’ (Shining Star), named for former PM Golda Meir, who was also born in Kyiv."  Feldhospital #UkraineWar 
Except at in #Canada, #israel #SaudiArabia etc. #Haiti #Egypt running out of characters. 
He’s Not the only #RussianOligarch that #Israel welcomed with open arms 
Just 100 meters away from this compound, there’s a villa owned by an Iraqi politician who declared in person inside the parliament of #Iraq that he visited #Israel. Why #Iran didn’t struck this villa?
Why would #Russia ask for #Military #aid from #China when both have the most badass militaries and weapons on the planet #USA + #Israel can't beat, let alone @NATO?   Your Perception Mgmt Strategy + #Disinfo team are really bad, @JoeBiden. Lay off @McDonalds &amp; @Starbucks, Dudes!
Why isn’t Israel 🇮🇱 under sanctions for their attacks to Palestine 🇵🇸? Why is there no media coverage of their violations of human rights and residential areas shelling? #UkraineWar #RussianArmy #USA #NATO #Kyiv #Kiev #WW3 #UkraineRussianWar #palestine #israel

@RepCarlos shares his experience from his #israel trip w/@AIPAC and says it straight forward: #israel prospers, while Iran, not only is determined to acquire nuclear weapons but also, with its proxies, Hezbollah and Hamas, is engaged in terrorist activities all across the region. 
Masjedi who was summoned by Iraq’s MOFA argues “#IRGC missiles didn’t target #Iraq sovereignty, nor insulted the Iraqi government/nation. Tehran only wants Iraqis to put an end to #Israel’s evil actions, finish these actions once and for all”. 3
A 🧵  Iran-Iraq relations look to be strained at the moment. A day after #IRGC fired missiles at “#Israel’s strategic center” in #Erbil, KR; Iran Foreign Ministry spokesman @SKhatibzadeh declared “one of neighbors (#Iraq) has turned into a center of threats against #Iran”. 1
turns out facility was indeed used by #Israel , some US official telling nytimes #erbil  
Remember this man. No 24HR TV coverage like #Ukraine, no emergency aid, no statements or condemnations against #Israel . No sanctions or boycotts, None! No #EU or #NATO weapons or #foreignfighters allowed to #Gaza.  #NATO doesn't have members but vassals and hypocrites. #StopWars 
Where do I put my money down on this being a #Russian hack, just to get back at #Israel for trying to broker an honest cease-fire in #Ukraine?  I wouldn't bet a dime on #MarchMadness, but I'd drop a hondo on this being linked back to #PutinTheMurderer.
