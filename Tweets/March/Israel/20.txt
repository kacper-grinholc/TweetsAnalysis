#Israel has too many Russian oligarchs giving their money to the politicians. 
Foolish hypocritical imbeciles in the joint Arab list are once again the most embarrassing thing to come out of the state of #Israel…openly siding with Russia and blaming NATO for Russia’s imperialist war crimes.   Appalling.

It has been obvious that #Israel has been duplicitous in relation to genocide in #Ukraine. Sad coming from a people who were the victims of genocide by other Nazis. As #Zelensky says, it’s time to choose between good and evil. 
@larrybird19701 @ZelenskyyUa Many were, others weren't. I get what he was trying to do. I think people are deliberately choosing to ignore the message. Yes, voting for #Israel at the UN would be nice... but who really cares about the UN? I think real cooperation, which is quite open, is much more important.

@KyivIndependent @UmlandAndreas Yeah, I agree that #Israel do more in weapons support. They ought to put themselves in Ukraine’s shoes. With Germany &amp; the UK showing their true colors, Ukraine could use a real ally. Russia is playing dirty &amp; Israel doesn’t need to worry about asking Putin for permission.

Translation: In a video message to #Israel , President #Selenskyj equated Russia with Nazi Germany and accused the Kremlin of plotting to wipe out Ukraine. All developments around the #Ukrainekrieg in the live blog: 
Absolutely insane level of character assassination against @ZelenskyyUa for merely reminding #Israel that there were also some righteous Ukrainians who saved Jewish lives during the #Holocaust. Nor is he spitting in #Israel's face by asking for assistance &amp; remembering the good. 
Since #Zionists are so keen on lying to make the criminal fake state of "#israel" look good. Here's an infograph based on facts.  #Israel, #USA, #NaziGermany, #Russia, and #SouthAfrica are all war criminals despicable states that tortured/tortures humanity.  #FreePalestine 
@realConnieBevan 2/2. current government, #Israel is one of the few western countries that has not even joined in on sanctions against #Russia (to Zelensky's great disappointment as he has said). Zelensky's use of his "Judaism" to bring in Israel to his side are quite irritating &amp; will not work.

In case you missed: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky compared the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the events of the Holocaust while speaking to Israel's Knesset.  #Israel | #Ukraine️ | #Russia  
@Quicktake Seriously #Israel. You're making me feel ashamed to be Jewish. Failing to condemn, as strongly as possible, the actions of a dictator, who appropriated the term "Nazi" in order to justify perpetrating crimes against humanity in Ukraine, is morally reprehensible.
"We intend to remain alive. Our neighbors want to see us dead. This is not a question that leaves much room for compromise." G. Meir #Israel  #Ukrainian President #Zelenksyy's speech to Israeli lawmakers 
#Israel  1/ Iron Dome could only intercept some of the Russian ordnance. Ukraine does have tech like this, but not enough. For cruise missiles they would need high end kit from USA, but that stuff is complex and needs specialist training.  Explained here 
Who other than the Arabs are you gunna look at at this time for genuine logical points?  For almost a century the Arab World has gone through the exact things #Ukraine is going through thanks to #Israel 
#Israel is a sorry excuse for what the #Zionists of 1948 envisioned. #ZelenskyyIsAWarHero has become #UkrainesBenGurion  #NaftaliBennett is Israel's Neville Chamberlain. I wonder how much $$ #RussianOligarchs have donated to Israeli politicians? #StandWithUkraine #DeposePutin 
Zelensky requests help from Israel - #status_of_jerusalem #capital_city #jerusalem #israel 
#WtfVideos #Watch "#Zelensky blasts #Israel for #refusing to send weapons and says Putin is planning a 'final solution'" on #YouTube 
This is the tragedy of #Israel. If one side supports something, the other side does not.  It confuses the moral compass...and I hate that the Palestinian parties in the Knesset feel that they have to take the position that they're taking. #Putin cares nothing for them. NOTHING. 
@NTarnopolsky Because #Israel is as guilty as Russia when it comes to illegal occupation and murder of its neighbours.
Is a nation's right to exist universal or is it not? You'd think #Israel would take a side on this one.  #IStandWithUkraine 
#Ukraine : This video is not related to you. But my purpose of post this is to show that patriotism is always at the Top. What maturity! Dedication! Passion to serve our country. #India is proud of you. #Ukrainian #Russia #USA #NATO #Israel 
Stop comparing Israel to Russia.   #Israel has nothing to do with Russia,   Israel has the right to *defend* itself from the terror, Russia has NO right to attack Ukraine without any reason.
Bravo!  No aid to #Israel .👊
