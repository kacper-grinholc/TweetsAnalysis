#Israel has too many Russian oligarchs giving their money to the politicians. 
Foolish hypocritical imbeciles in the joint Arab list are once again the most embarrassing thing to come out of the state of #Israel‚Ä¶openly siding with Russia and blaming NATO for Russia‚Äôs imperialist war crimes.   Appalling.

It has been obvious that #Israel has been duplicitous in relation to genocide in #Ukraine. Sad coming from a people who were the victims of genocide by other Nazis. As #Zelensky says, it‚Äôs time to choose between good and evil. 
@larrybird19701 @ZelenskyyUa Many were, others weren't. I get what he was trying to do. I think people are deliberately choosing to ignore the message. Yes, voting for #Israel at the UN would be nice... but who really cares about the UN? I think real cooperation, which is quite open, is much more important.

Translation: In a video message to #Israel , President #Selenskyj equated Russia with Nazi Germany and accused the Kremlin of plotting to wipe out Ukraine. All developments around the #Ukrainekrieg in the live blog: 
Absolutely insane level of character assassination against @ZelenskyyUa for merely reminding #Israel that there were also some righteous Ukrainians who saved Jewish lives during the #Holocaust. Nor is he spitting in #Israel's face by asking for assistance &amp; remembering the good. 
Since #Zionists are so keen on lying to make the criminal fake state of "#israel" look good. Here's an infograph based on facts.  #Israel, #USA, #NaziGermany, #Russia, and #SouthAfrica are all war criminals despicable states that tortured/tortures humanity.  #FreePalestine 
@realConnieBevan 2/2. current government, #Israel is one of the few western countries that has not even joined in on sanctions against #Russia (to Zelensky's great disappointment as he has said). Zelensky's use of his "Judaism" to bring in Israel to his side are quite irritating &amp; will not work.

Only the Jews of #UkraineÔ∏è?  What about the other 99%?  I accept he was aiming his comments at Israel, but disappointed he resorted to this.  Mind you, #Israel has not shown themselves to be 'onside' - Too many connections with #Russia? @BorisJohnson @ZelenskyyUa @MorawieckiM 
Israeli lawmakers tear into #Zelensky for Holocaust comparisons in Knesset speech #Israel #holocaust  via @timesofisrael 
Strong words and rightly so but will they have the desired effect. #Zelenskiy has been heard but has #Israel listened?  #FinalSolution #Ukraine 
Why indeed? #Ukraine's president asks for #Israel's support in address to its authorities &amp; citizens. ‚ÄúOne can keep asking why we can‚Äôt get weapons from you, or why Israel hasn‚Äôt imposed strong sanctions against #Russia. #StandWithUkraine #UkraineUnderAttack
Im insensitive towards pictures of dead children and the effects of bombings, wars and genocide. All because I have witnessed the crimes of #Israel since I was a kid. Thanks isreal!
Zelenskiy Calls Out Israel, Compares Russian Invasion to Nazi Invasion o...  via @YouTube phooey to #Israel offering   #aliyah to Jewish pilgrims BUT yet at expense of Palestinian people.  No No! #Ukraine
I think that #ukraine president #zelinsky is fed up with the hypocritical role #israel is playing to please #russia while people in his country are dying every day because of the Russian missiles he could shoot down with the Iron Dome that protects israel against missiles 
#Israel is morally obligated to #StandWithUkraine 
Thankfully this putz is not going to be in the House much longer.  #Israel is our most important ally in the Middle East if not the entire world. A veteran would know that and not try to place conditions on our friendship.   Kinzinger is an embarrassment.   @ian_mckelvey 
In case you missed: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky compared the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the events of the Holocaust while speaking to Israel's Knesset.  #Israel | #UkraineÔ∏è | #Russia  
@Quicktake Seriously #Israel. You're making me feel ashamed to be Jewish. Failing to condemn, as strongly as possible, the actions of a dictator, who appropriated the term "Nazi" in order to justify perpetrating crimes against humanity in Ukraine, is morally reprehensible.
"We intend to remain alive. Our neighbors want to see us dead. This is not a question that leaves much room for compromise." G. Meir #Israel  #Ukrainian President #Zelenksyy's speech to Israeli lawmakers 
#Israel  1/ Iron Dome could only intercept some of the Russian ordnance. Ukraine does have tech like this, but not enough. For cruise missiles they would need high end kit from USA, but that stuff is complex and needs specialist training.  Explained here 
Who other than the Arabs are you gunna look at at this time for genuine logical points?  For almost a century the Arab World has gone through the exact things #Ukraine is going through thanks to #Israel 
#Israel is a sorry excuse for what the #Zionists of 1948 envisioned. #ZelenskyyIsAWarHero has become #UkrainesBenGurion  #NaftaliBennett is Israel's Neville Chamberlain. I wonder how much $$ #RussianOligarchs have donated to Israeli politicians? #StandWithUkraine #DeposePutin 
Zelensky requests help from Israel - #status_of_jerusalem #capital_city #jerusalem #israel 
#WtfVideos #Watch "#Zelensky blasts #Israel for #refusing to send weapons and says Putin is planning a 'final solution'" on #YouTube 
This is the tragedy of #Israel. If one side supports something, the other side does not.  It confuses the moral compass...and I hate that the Palestinian parties in the Knesset feel that they have to take the position that they're taking. #Putin cares nothing for them. NOTHING. 
@NTarnopolsky Because #Israel is as guilty as Russia when it comes to illegal occupation and murder of its neighbours.
Is a nation's right to exist universal or is it not? You'd think #Israel would take a side on this one.  #IStandWithUkraine 
#Ukraine : This video is not related to you. But my purpose of post this is to show that patriotism is always at the Top. What maturity! Dedication! Passion to serve our country. #India is proud of you. #Ukrainian #Russia #USA #NATO #Israel 
Stop comparing Israel to Russia.   #Israel has nothing to do with Russia,   Israel has the right to *defend* itself from the terror, Russia has NO right to attack Ukraine without any reason.
Bravo!  No aid to #Israel .üëä
