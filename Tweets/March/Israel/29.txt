They loot their people, don’t hold elections, impoverish their neighborhoods, etc.  BUT  They distribute free food when they kill civilians from a state they claim is exercising terror over them.  This is #Palestine. They did that to #Lebanon. Now they do it to #Israel.

But sure let’s blame the victim, because it’s more convenient to do so.#Israel 
#Israel's privileged belief that it can have an endless 'safe' occupation and Apartheid over Palestinians, without suffering any casualties of its own has been failing for 55-years.  Yesterday 6 people died as a result of that belief. 
whenever something happened anywhere in the world, I would run to .@CNN to find out what was going on. So when I hear ongoing terrorist attack in #Israel I run to CNN and find out -nothing! Not a mention. No wonder people turning to social media for news. This is horrible.
Are you advocating for normalisation with #Israel too?Given the souring relationship between #Djibouti&amp;Kulmiye it’s understandable why extrapolating appeals to Bihi&amp;Co.Anyhow the US sanctioned #UAE for #Yemen&amp;as survivors of Genocide we should be cautious not to enable war crimes

My deep condolences to the people of #Israel. The horrific terror attacks will not bring any benefit.
Yet another deadly terrorist attack this time in central Israel leaving five dead. Palestinians in Jenin, Nablus, and Jerusalem celebrate the cold blooded murder of civilians and the world is silent. This is why security checkpoints… May their memories be a blessing #israel

@cnnbrk These attacks are sad beyond words. Do the Israelis believe they can stop such attacks by oppressing Palestinians even more? Something has to give. Give peace a chance, #Israel, by giving back part of their homeland. @naftalibennett P.S. Jews are dying in Ukraine ✡️🇺🇦

@EmmanuelMacron Sir one grouping is required- in my head that could be the most consequential grouping - IFI : #India, #France and #Israel
@EmmanuelMacron call your phone buddy #Putin once again - he knows much of Middle-East terrorists  and tell 🇮🇱#Israel to surrender like you constantly do aiming to force 🇺🇦 #ukraine to give up  fucking phone operator
In March 2022 so far, separate from #Ukraine 's agony, #terrorists of the #IslamicState have murdered 63 people in #Pakistan and 11 people in #Israel in three separate attacks.   That #violence should be more newsworthy than a slap or a joke.  #Terrorism #ISIS #ISIL #Terror #IS
@AIPAC what happened to you being neutral in Israeli politics? As a member you are really pushing me and other young American Jews away by your thinly veiled right-wing shift. #Israel #PoliticsLive #AIPAC 
"However, any subsea line [btw #Israel &amp; #Turkey] would need to cross waters of either #Cyprus, which #Ankara does not recognize, or #Syria, with which Ankara has no diplomatic relations and has backed rebels fighting the gov't in #Damascus." via @Reuters

SLAYINGS IN BNAI BRAK: Ambassadors from the United States and European Union condemned the latest #terror attack in #Israel, which claimed five lives in #BneiBrak and Ramat Gan. 
#Israel on high alert after a wave of terrorist attacks ahead of Ramadan:   'One attack begets another,' @NeriZilber says. 
Israeli Security: Raising the degree of security alert in Israeli areas and inside the West Bank  #Dia_Palestina  #Israel
Three terror incidents in #Israel in a week resulted in the deaths of 11 Israelis. The Palestinian resistance takes a different path. Individual actions are taking the place of primitive rockets.
Just to be fair, and while you're now crying on #Israel deaths of today, please also remember the #Palestinian children killed by Israeli occupation forces. Enough double standards as you're doing also with #Ukraine Crisis
Inshallah all your nights will be difficult Israeli media: Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz: A very difficult night, and we will restore security to the streets of "#Israel"
Palestinian youth Zia Hamarsheh martyred in Tel Aviv operation. He belongs Jenin.  #telaviv  #Israel  #Palestine  #25years 
@katia_ouarda Never takes much time for islamic terrorist apologists to spread the most inane whataboutery. #Israel
First let's sort out respecting the rights of human beings to walk around on the streets of #Israel without being shot at by Islamic #Terrorists 
It seems that Diaa Hamarsheh ended his short and insignificant life with nothing to show for it besides the murder of five human beings who never wronged him. May their blood be avenged. May his name and remembrance be obliterated. #Israel

The 10,000th #Ukrainian refugee landed in #Israel yesterday.  
32-year-old Ya’akov Shalom from Bnei Brak was one of the 5 people murdered in today's deadly terror attack in Bnei Brak, central #Israel. He was a father of five children. My heart is with Ya’akov's loved ones in the wake of this tragedy. May his memory forever be a blessing. 🕯️
