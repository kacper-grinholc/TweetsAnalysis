Direct flights from @BostonLogan to #Israel are back ! The first EL-AL flight in two years takes off this evening from #Boston. Great to see personnel from @ELALUSA &amp; @Massport at the 🎀 ✂️ ceremony. New England is just that much closer to the Holy Land - Travel well everyone! 
As the #MiddleEast strives to be a region of peace and stability, it is disheartening to hear of today’s unconscionable attack in #Israel. As a global community, we must continue to disavow hate-driven acts and work to build communities and nations where hearts only know love.
Life moves ahead. You don't always have to undo what has been done. Those who talk about resettling #KashmiriPandits should see what did Jews do who were displaced from Germany. They moved ahead made a home of their own which stands strong in the middle of mighty enemies! #Israel
@GiGiHadid @bellahadid need to go educate @justinbieber on #israel's #EthnicCleansing of Palestinians. #Palestine has become an #ApartheidIsrael. #IsraeliCrimes reported to #humanrights #organizations as America continues to fund israel to commit crimes of #humanity.

Terror attack in #Haifa #Israel. Both #Palestinian terrorists eliminated by Israeli police. 
@SecBlinken @yairlapid Why is #Israel supporting a dictator and war criminal committing #Genocide in #Ukraine️
Important message of peace and unity from an Arab Israeli MK and member of the governing coalition. #Israel #Zionism is a progressive pluralistic self determination movement. 
The attack has since been claimed by #ISIS media. Damn, #IS in #Israel.

#BREAKING #BreakingNews  #Israel: Confirmed terrorist attack in #Hadera.   5 wounded in the shooting in Hadera, MDA says. Police say two officers are hurt.  At least 2 suspects have been shot by police. Emergency crews are still arriving on the scene. 
This is what it was like in the 90s, a period where not a day past without terror attacks and deaths on the streets of #Israel.  If any would be terrorist knew that their family will be expelled to Gaza the very next day...there wouldn't be terrorism.   #IsraeliLivesMatter 
Russia Today called the Hadera attack "terrorist" from the start, a term no liberal western news outlet would use. "Militant" is preferred by BBC and The Guardian. However, now it is ISIS perhaps this will change..  @Moutet @AAhronheim  @edrormba  @sfrantzman  #Israel
The statement also confirms that #ISIS is behind the attack by Muhammad Abu Qia'an in the city of Beersheba in the Negev region a few days ago. 2/2 #Israel #IDF #USA #Biden #Syria #Iraq #Sina #Iran
