#Zelensky tells #Israel to stay out of debate about honoring #Nazi collaborators   #Ukrainian ambassador says honoring of Stepan #Bandera of #BabiYar memory is an internal issue, calls Israeli comments against it *counterproductive*   via @timesofisrael
@ozidug @revoltinghippie @Keir_Starmer He is funded by a regime condemned by Amnesty and the UN for war crimes in #Palestine.. #ISRAEL  AND he supports them.. to the point he is willing to destroy Labour to do it.. ALL the left wing members he has attacked and suspended are supporters of  #Palestine. 
@MiddleEastMnt #Israel is more cruel than #Russia. Who didn't know what is happening in #Palestine and #Syria.
@AdamMilstein You just made that shit up after killing thier scientist's #Apartheid #israel And if you forgotten it was #trump who walked away from the agreement and not #iran In regards to illegal occupation and illegal settlements loo into #ApartheidIsrael #IsraeliApartheid of #Palestine
@MichaelKugelman UN has lost its credibility as a neutral body long time ago. It never called out to real terrorists like #Israel n is letting it go on Apartheid spree to date. Syria. Iraq, Afghanistan,  Libya r living examples of its phenomenal failure. So its these designations are a joke.
#Israel...funding @keir_starmer so of course he supports them..  Their invasion; bombing, withholding water , food, electricity, medical supplies.. their evictions and destruction of Palestinians homes.. Israel wont stop until Palestine is wiped off the map. #StarmerOut  
How could #Israel talk about #RussianUkrainianWar yet they have engaged in #PalestineUnderAttack
@thetimes @naftalibennett I‚Äôm a #jew who supports #israel but I‚Äôm disappointed that you‚Äôve refused to sell #IronDome technology to #ukraine. Israel is a fearless nation yet now it is cowering to a war criminal. If u demand your allies stand w/ you, why r u now waffling? @TimesofIsrael

#Kuwait author who opposes boycotting #Israel attacks Kuwaiti academics for boycotting an event in #Bahrain because an Israeli academic was scheduled to deliver a speech. "Your (boycott) behavior does not represent Kuwaitis," writes Jasem. 
WATCH: Irish politician lays bare the hypocrisy of inaction with regard to Israel‚Äôs decades of brutal human rights abuses against Palestinians, both in occupied territories, and within Israel itself.  #Israel #apartheid #HumanRights  
#Israel is a criminal organization.  #Apartheid and fake laws to oppress the palestinians, the owners of the land. 
Attention everyone who cares about #Israel 
It is utter hypocrisy to expect #Putin to face war crimes charges at the Hague if Tony Blair hasn't?! You commentators of the MSM are utter hypocrites. And if #Israel hasn't faced the UN for proven war crimes and human rights violations daily then how do you expect Putin will?
This #Kuwait intellectual lost his column because of his views that support secularism and peace in the Middle East (with #Israel). He Tweets that he'll launch his own website where he can freely express his views.

"The #Jewish people know all too well the threat of being eradicated. Today, Ukraine is #Israel. Ukrainians are falling victim to Russia‚Äôs evil war jThe Russian invaders are motivated and instructed to commit acts of genocide against Ukrainians." 
Will #nato be avin a word with #Israel about the 70 war they‚Äôve waged on #Palestine
#Starmer supports #Israel and its war crimes in #Palestine.. Yet demands sanctions against #Russia and its war  crimes in #Ukraine ..why ? #FollowTheMoney.. He's funded by #Israel. A regime condemned by Amnesty and the UN for war crimes in #Palestine  #StarmerOut
