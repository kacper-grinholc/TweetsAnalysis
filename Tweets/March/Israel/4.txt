What was meant for evil God uses for good just like this war God used it to get more of his people ( Jews) back to their land as promised the second return of Jews to Israel ! Hallelujah praise be to God of Israel #Israel

How could #Israel talk about #RussianUkrainianWar yet they have engaged in #PalestineUnderAttack
@thetimes @naftalibennett I’m a #jew who supports #israel but I’m disappointed that you’ve refused to sell #IronDome technology to #ukraine. Israel is a fearless nation yet now it is cowering to a war criminal. If u demand your allies stand w/ you, why r u now waffling? @TimesofIsrael

#Slovakia,#Greece,#Spain,#Cyprus,#Romania continue to sabotage the security of #Europe. Even #Israel recognizes every country in the Balkans, including the country of #Kosovo. #WarCriminalPutin and #Serbia orchestrating protests in neighboring #Montenegro. 
When Americans cry for #Ukrainians but cheer for #Israel #InConfusionItHurtItself

A pair of old #Israel haters 
#Kuwait author who opposes boycotting #Israel attacks Kuwaiti academics for boycotting an event in #Bahrain because an Israeli academic was scheduled to deliver a speech. "Your (boycott) behavior does not represent Kuwaitis," writes Jasem. 
WATCH: Irish politician lays bare the hypocrisy of inaction with regard to Israel’s decades of brutal human rights abuses against Palestinians, both in occupied territories, and within Israel itself.  #Israel #apartheid #HumanRights  
#Israel is a criminal organization.  #Apartheid and fake laws to oppress the palestinians, the owners of the land. 
Attention everyone who cares about #Israel 
It is utter hypocrisy to expect #Putin to face war crimes charges at the Hague if Tony Blair hasn't?! You commentators of the MSM are utter hypocrites. And if #Israel hasn't faced the UN for proven war crimes and human rights violations daily then how do you expect Putin will?
This #Kuwait intellectual lost his column because of his views that support secularism and peace in the Middle East (with #Israel). He Tweets that he'll launch his own website where he can freely express his views.

Yet critics of #Israel and ITS invasion and bombing of #Palestine are attacked by @keir_starmer.. #FollowTheMoney.. #Israel funds #Starmer.. Seems his " outrage" depends on 🤑🤑🤑🤑 #NotFitToLead. #StarmerOut 
"The #Jewish people know all too well the threat of being eradicated. Today, Ukraine is #Israel. Ukrainians are falling victim to Russia’s evil war jThe Russian invaders are motivated and instructed to commit acts of genocide against Ukrainians." 
Will #nato be avin a word with #Israel about the 70 war they’ve waged on #Palestine
#Starmer supports #Israel and its war crimes in #Palestine.. Yet demands sanctions against #Russia and its war  crimes in #Ukraine ..why ? #FollowTheMoney.. He's funded by #Israel. A regime condemned by Amnesty and the UN for war crimes in #Palestine  #StarmerOut
