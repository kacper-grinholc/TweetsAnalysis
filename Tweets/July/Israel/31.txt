@NourMortaja May Allah Almighty protect the innocent #childrens of #Palestine &amp; Save Palestine from the brutality of #Israel. AMEEN!
All eyes on #SheikhJarrah, #Silwan, &amp; the whole of #Jerusalem. #Israel’s Supreme Court has habitually bought time for the creeping annexation of #Palestinian land &amp; homes. Stop the dispossession&amp; expulsion of the Palestinian people #SaveSheikhJarrah #SaveSilwan. #FreePalestine

#Israel is still holding Palestine under it's control. Just because Netanyahu is out does not mean Palestinians are safer and have more freedom. We remember Ghassan Kanafani's strong leadership.

The #Israeli occupation forces storm the house of Al kurd family in #SheikhJarrah neighborhood, and assault the residents and the activists. #SaveSheikhJarrah #Palestine #FreePalestine #Israel #IsraeliCrimes #IsraeliTerrorists #IsraeliTerrorism #IsraelTerrorists #BreakingNews 
#Biden has handled nothing in the context of #Gaza merely running interference for #Israel. 
Israel has provided intelligence data to UK and USA about Iran involvement in attack on Israel Ship. On other hand, Israel is preparing for retaliation.  #Iran #Israel
#UPDATE: #Israel military forces are on standby to conduct strikes against #Iran or Iranian targets in the region and are just waiting for the order. This is not a surprise considering they are usually ready for action at all times against Iran.
But #Israel? But #UK? You should go cherry-pick some more hocus pocus there prof. "IPO'Neill" petent pending...  Reddit to the best of my knowledge is not a scientific database but Science is hardly your thing?  "You Know?" 
#Murderous #Israel.  The real rogue nation in the #MiddleEast 
@IsraelRadar_com @N12News Iranian targets? If you're going to do it, hit them hard, and destroy their nuclear program. #Israel, #Iran
#UPDATE: #US, #UK and #Israel are all considering retaliation options against #Iran following the oil tanker attack that killed two 2 days ago, Israel has sent intelligence proving the attack was conducted by Iran, the damaged ship was boarded investigated and escorted by US navy
The toxic 'skunk water', which #Israel's occupation forces spray here in the occupied East #Jerusalem of #Palestine, is something that Israel is trying to export also.  #Pegasus software to target people online, #SkunkWater to target people offline. 
@Richard_palact There is no doubt that the Military Industrial Complex, and all modern War begins and ends with Israel. #America is #Israel's Poodle 🐩, not the other way around, and yes, of course it is all tied to money, campaign donations, favourable press etc #ApartheidIsrael #FreePalestine
@PressTV I am glad to be a citizen on the African continent. At least I can say that the continent, including #SouthAfrica, has been liberated from #Apartheid colonizers and we will be doing the same in all of #Palestine - liberating the blessed lands from #terrorist #israel.
#Hezbollah’s infrastructure and capabilities have grown exponentially since 2006 under @UNIFIL_’s nose. The group actually uses UNIFIL’s area of operations for cross-border attacks into #Israel, including breaches of the border fence:

So, israeli spy outfits like #NSO get free ride in the media after threats &amp; pressure. There are several govt &amp; military linked spy companies working for #israel &amp; selling their services to friendly politicians to use to blackmail democratic oppostitions. #boycott #BDS #apartheid
