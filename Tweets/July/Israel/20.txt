It’s clear that #NSO of #Israel is a commercial company and sells the spying software #pegasus only to “vetted govts”. If #IndianGovt didn’t commission the #PegasusProject that targeted govt’s ministers itself, opposition leaders, journalists &amp; activists, then who did?
As #Israel gets more and more exposed, it is becoming more difficult to side with Israel, especially for American Jews. A recent poll showed that 25% of American Jews believe Israel is an Apartheid state!

@AlisonFSchwartz Attacking Jews, Palestinians or any race or religion is always wrong. However as #Israel blames all #Jews for its abuses many unfortunately believe them. If Israel stops calling anti-Zionists❤ as being anti-semites🤮 it would help. Attacking Zionists or KKK etc is understandable

@MortChristenson I'm guessing what #Israel does in #Iran, it doesn't talk about. That is probably somewhat true of the US, as well, except that in the latter case the policy-makers are pursuing a different, and wrong-headed, approach.

@Wikipedia Has #wikipedia also targeted #Israel along with @benandjerrys decision to enter politics? Incredible that only ONE city is listed as "former markets" with 2 notable countries. Where are all the other cities? An exception of Israel for defamation, not fact reporting.

@sienekndncamer1 @BeckyFurgason @AviKaner @benandjerrys #Israel's own holy book (the #Tanakh) describes how they took the land by way of #genocide and #ethnicCleansing of the #Canaanites. Hence it is called "the land of #Canaan" in the earlier writings. The writings say they slaughtered women, child and animals too.

@benundjerrys It‘s simply #anti-Semitic to boycott Israel. Why don’t you do this with for instance China because of Tibet? Yes, just because #Israel is the Jewish state. So shame on you!
