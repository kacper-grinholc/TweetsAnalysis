#Israel may end up exposing #Modi, President @EmmanuelMacron of #France has jumped the gun by naming #Morocco on the matter of #Hacking his own phone. #PrimeMinister_Modi had most interest in hacking his phone by #Pegasus to preempt #Rafale_Aircraft_Scam. 
THREAD: 1/@RashidaTlaib, @IlhanMN think they represent Muslims in America and the world. Since July 21, they've been raising hell over #Israel, #Saudi, #Tunisia's president, accusing them of violation of human rights, international law.
‚ÄúIt may be easy to forget but #Israel &amp; #Iran were allies before the 1979 revolution in Iran. Israel has reportedly penetrated the regime‚Äôs intelligence and security apparatus at the highest levels. It has leveraged this success to inflict major damage on the Iranian nuke program
.@selinnasi: From Ankara‚Äôs side, while strategic imperatives have long been pushing Turkey to mend its ties with Israel, bashing Israel has become instrumental in mobilizing the constituency at the domestic level #Erdogan #Turkey #Israel
.@selinnasi: By offering mediation between Hamas and #Israel, #Turkey is trying to present itself as a useful ally to Israel while also trying to regain lost ground to its competitors in regional diplomacy
.@selinnasi: Erdoƒüan may have contacted his Israeli counterpart. However, Ankara has yet to congratulate Bennett. #Turkey #Israel

#Breaking  The US Is Undermining the Abraham Accords In contrast to the #Trump‚Äôs tough stance on Iran, #Biden‚Äôs wish to negotiate and reach a weak agreement with #Iran undermines the strategic rationale for the agreements between #Israel and Gulf states. 
@SenatorDurbin @AymanM @MSNBC @POTUS While you‚Äôre there, please educate him that #Israel is not the #DeathStar that he tries to paint it as.  Thanks @SenatorDurbin

#PfizerVaccine is so "effective" that in #Israel the #Covid19 cases (including serious cases, ICU) are exploding and the numbers are no different than during the summer of 2020. It should be a #scandal, but it seems that everybody involved is bribed.
#PeterBeinart hates #Israel and #Zionism 
#Israel: a society based on crime, razzia's, murder @naftalibennett @ministerBZ Let all the world boycot it, until they behave in a normal and moral way.
