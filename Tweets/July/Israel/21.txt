  #Lebanon attacks #Israel.  Little news of Israel being attacked or defending itself, just like when #Hamas attacked Israel, because they can't claim Israel is oppressing Lebanon. Israel was attacked just the same as by Hamas and responded the same way.

#May2021: #Israel #kills 67 #Palestinian #children in #Gaza.  #July2021: #RealMadrid and #Barcelona play in #TelAviv washing the face of #Zionism. #Complicity! 
#Israel: Pfizer vaccine "effectiveness in preventing serious illness is now at 80% for the general population &amp; 50% for the elderly"  @dvir_a: “The problems aren’t with the vaccine, they are with the data”

#Israel launches air strikes on Lebanon and Syria as part of US-backed shadow war 
@CAMERAorg @AP @TamarSternthal @AP payback for #Israel outing AP's cohabitation agreement with #Hamas in #gaza ? Their offices became a parking lot. 
Un grande articolo (2018) sempre maledettamente attuale. "The New #Israel|i Is Frankenstein’s Monster. We have created a new creature. We are the creature that pushed aside Frankenstein, smashed the gate and left the laboratory to wreak havoc in the neighborhood..." 
Big surprise. #Israel's obsessive desire to know every word spoken about it in the rest of the world led it to develop malicious #spyware to be sold on the #cyberarms market to other oppressive regimes that will entrench authoritarianism worldwide. Well, that and huge profits.
Very sad and worrying what these #children are #taught in #Israel.  #Hate is injected respect the #different, in particular the #Arab, from an early age and the need to #destroy them, to make them #disappear.

Let everyone pray on #Jerusalem's #TempleMount. And once again the Arab Triangle Israelis proved their loyalty is to the Palestinian state, not to #Israel. Bring back @AvigdorLiberman's swap plan.  
@ArifCRafiq As a #US ally and a “democracy”, #Israel is of course beyond reproach! After all, the country has regular elections. And it grants equal rights to women and gays, unless they happen to be #Arab #Palestinians. #ApartheidIsrael 
The Israeli Baseball Team are in the #TokyoOlympics right now!   This is the first time in history that a team from #Israel team qualifies for the Olympics in baseball.  Made up of players from different backgrounds, we can’t wait to watch this group make history. 
@tammyt1682 @DanKrasnoff1 @bethanyshondark It is not simply the focus on one state rather than others, it's applying to that one state standards not applied to any other state. THAT is the distinction made by the IHRA definition of #antisemitism and why those who apply double standards to #Israel seek to undermine #IHRA.

Ah, the delightful fruit of the #AbrahamAccords! #Israel and the #UAE spying on everyone. #AxisOfAutocracy. 
This guy just said that #Israel isn’t an #apartheid state… The zionist regime is forcing Palestinians out of their homes. They’ve taken away their rights. And countless human rights violations. But hey Canada did the same thing so it’s okay… you tool 
In 2021, one of the biggest issues dividing #Israel and the #US is President Joe Biden’s goal of returning to the 2015 #Iran nuclear agreement, which led to a deep and lasting rift between #Washington and #Jerusalem.
