@ChristopherJM @WSJ A $50mil investment? That is a terrible joke. What a crap deal for #Ukraine.
LR @RepMcCaul on the US-German agreement on #NordStream2: "The #Putin regime will use the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as a weapon of coercion against #Ukraine and transatlantic energy security as soon as it is operational."  Read the full statement here⬇️
“#Germany &amp;  the U.S... would try to ensure that #Ukraine continues to receive roughly $3B in annual transit fees that #Russia pays under its current agreement with Kyiv, which runs through 2024. Officials didn’t explain how to ensure that Russia continues to make the payments.”

#US completed #GreenCard #lottery for 2022 year. People from #Russia had won 6,001 green cards. Same number of citizens from #Uzbekistan will be able to come to #USA in 2022. 4,495 green cards were won in #Ukraine. Just slightly over 2,000 green cards were awarded for #Armenia.
And you wonder, how #Poland could possibly reject an offer to help weakening its partner #Ukraine and undermining its own security? Really? #NordStream2 
@wjakobik_en This is gonna be the biggest fail in Bidens term: Complete the largest fossil fuel project as a present to #Putin. 1bn for #Ukraine for green energy, best spent before invasion. EU trust broken. On Putin’s bill: unspecified threats from GER 👹Huh! 😂#nordstream2 #blackday4Europe

It seems like the #Nordstream2 stalemate between USA 🇺🇸 and Germany 🇩🇪 ended in favor of #Germany. A huge diplomatic success for Merkel as #Biden Administration bowed down and waived any possible sanctions. The two allies also agreed to bribe #Ukraine.  
Support for @Tsihanouskaya—who is hands down the most impressive leader seen in #Ukraine, #Belarus, and #Georgia in a generation—in the US 🇺🇸 and in the European Union 🇪🇺 sends a message to Lukashenko, yes.   But it also sends a message to Moscow. And to Russians.

@DeanoBeano1 @EvaKBartlett Let's remember that #Avakov's assistance is a sponsor of that hate website "peacekeeper". They mock everyone dead or alive who said even one word in criticism re #Ukraine. Even foreign journalists and some politicians demanded for the site to be banned, but it's still working.
🇺🇸🇩🇪 #NordStream2 deal: Seemingly unenforceable on the central transit $$ billions issue, and chicken feed in terms of compensatory green tech investment, with no German or EU political opening to #Ukraine. A #Budapest Memorandum for the energy sector, at first glance.

According to several sources, the deal on #NordStream2  achieved by the US and Germany mentions that sanctions will be imposed against #Russia  _ _ _IF_ _ _ it tries to use energy as a weapon against #Ukraine.   Seriously? IF?  Anyone doubts that Russia will use it as a weapon?

"Rivneazot" makes fertilizers from #natgas, and is controlled by notorious fugitive oligarch Dmytro #Firtash via his #Ukraine chemical industry monopoly  @GroupDFofficial. "Group DF" rep told media the chemical #AirPollution resulting from the accident was within safe limits.

We wish everyone a joyous #Eid al Adha, especially #Crimean Tatars in #Ukraine and around the world! 
The chemical substance spilled into the air in #Rivne #Ukraine is named as "nitric oxide", a product of nitric acid from ruptured tanks coming in contact with air.
