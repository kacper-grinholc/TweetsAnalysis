@ChristopherJM Olga again repeated same view of nationalists in #Ukraine by mixing conflict in Donbass and gas pipeline. She mentioned about 14,000 fatalities in Donbass, but failed to mentioned that Ukrainian soldiers have been  actively shelling the region for the last 7 years.

@ChristopherJM Olga is repeating radical view of nationalists in #Ukraine. She is missing several points. Ukraine failed to have own foreign policy, failed to held direct talks with #Russia about gas pipeline, transit fees. Instead, #Zelensky relied on #EU, #Germany, #USA. Huge mistake!
@RachaelWood10 @olgatokariuk LOL. #Ukraine at least officially bans any propaganda, literature anything that has to do with Communism. Last time I checked #China is a communist nation. How would #Zelensky feel to be even much closer with China? #WhiteHouse won't be happy &amp; it might cut off aid to Ukraine.

@olgatokariuk #Poroshenko &amp; now #Zelensky is repeating same mistakes that will cost dearly to #Ukraine and ordinary Ukrainians. Instead of relying on own policies &amp; have direct talks with #Russia, Ukraine relied on #EU, #Germany &amp; #US to solve own issues. Blame Ukrainian leadership, diplomats.
What’s important about the #NordStream2 deal: - 🇺🇸 prioritizes 🇩🇪 as a privileged partner in Europe  - 🇩🇪 support to #Ukraine’s energy transition seems scarce + more or less cheap talk for the moment. It’s really not “green” foreign policy (follow @eccoclimate on the topic)
@QrisEbeatu @DmytroKuleba @EU_Commission @NATO This makes zero sense....#NATO will not risk WW3 over #Ukraine. #Russia could annihilate Ukraine in a few days
@olgatokariuk Is #Ukraine an independent country or what? The West is responsible for own policies &amp; interests to pursue. 14,000 died in Donbass. Real tragedy. Did Ukrainian army &amp; volunteer battalions ever opened fire? Of course they did, which caused majority of fatalities &amp; destruction.

@vtchakarova . The US's ulterior motive was and probably is to block #Russia from delivering any more gas than needed for sufficient transfer fees for #Ukraine. That would render energy more expensive during transition. Now Germany has #NordStream2 and US #LNG. Suppliers diversity!

#Ukraine Prez upcoming US visit sidetracked Nordstream pipeline go-ahead, +50 bp against consensus benchmark rate ~10% inflation  Monetary tighten function +4% GDP snapback, affirms traditional price stability credential cenbank deputy. #EmergingMarkets
#Ukraine hits back as #US, #Germany reach deal on #NordStream2 and invokes right to hold formal talks with Brussels and Berlin, and says attempts to allay concerns ‘cannot be considered sufficient.’ 
President's Office comments on #Russia's complaint against #Ukraine to #ECHR
#CuppaJoe has given #MadamChancellor the go-ahead upon the condition that both 'countries [meaning, the U.S. and Germany] . . .  support [the] #Ukraine and . . .  sanction #Russia' . . .   
The Supreme Court of Prague has changed the classification of crimes committed by #Belarus citizen Alexei Fadeev, who fought against #Ukraine in the #Donbas &amp; extended his sentence from 4.5 years to 21 years.  This was announced by Ambassador of Ukraine to #Czechia @YPerebyinis. 
@Reuters #Ukraine has to shut up. The final demonstration that #NordStream2 is a german (not russian) project and that US is finally loosing the grip. Good. #Merkel #Biden

A DDoS attack is effective, but it’s not a #hack. It’s a disruption. It’s a nuisance. It’s loud music in a built-up area. However at that stage it seems that it was all #CyberBerkut were capable of doing.  Detective non-fiction:  #hacking #hackers #Ukraine 
#Ukraine can phase out #coal by 2030.   Report from @AuroraER_Oxford @ua_boell shows it is both technically feasible and creates economic opportunities.
President #Putin spoke with Federal Chancellor of #Germany Angela Merkel. Focus on #NordStream2 and #Ukraine crisis, incl necessity for Kiev to fulfil its commitments under #MinskAgreements. 
I've been waiting for @NikaMelkozerova to write this story for a long time.   Years ago, she briefly worked in one of #Ukraine's most grotesque and, unfortunately, "iconic" industries: international romance sites. 🤢

Our opening ceremony is now finished. Thanks to all for your active participation and to @anticrisismedia for its support. With its new office in #Kramatorsk, @genevacall will strongly increase its presence in eastern #Ukraine and keep promoting IHL among all actors. 
A lot to say here, but I think I'll only limit myself with one sentence: Kyiv has to finally grow up one day. #Ukraine #US #NS2 
Some wonderful murals in Kyiv. Lots of great street art there, but these three were my favourites. #travel #ukraine #streetart 
How are you supposed to focus on your meeting with this view out of the window #Ukraine

This 👇. Yesterday was a good day for #China and #Turkey in #Ukraine. For governance, rights and rule-of-law proponents, not so much. Expect more attempts at multi-vector pragmatism from Kyiv, and less willingness to be lectured about high-minded ideals. #NordStream2 
#Russia says #Ukraine blocking water supply to #Crimea in European lawsuit 
@GicAriana The #US provides about $300 million in aid to #Ukraine per year, &amp; about $150 million to #Russia which invaded &amp; occupied 7.5% of Ukrainian territory. That is a joke, particularly in light of what has just happened re #NordStream2.
The #US and #Germany reached an agreement regarding #NordStream2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, with the latter committing to promote energy security for #Ukraine and sanction #Russia if it uses energy as a weapon. 
We are proud to officially open a new office in #Kramatorsk, eastern #Ukraine today, from where we'll put all our efforts to reach the relevant actors to ensure #IHL is respected by all parties to the protracted conflict in the region 
@knakelibrakaren @mazzenilsson @MikaelSkillt Because we (#NATO) clearly acts as the enemy of #Russia. Arming Jihadi lunatics in #Tjetjenia and #Syria with the longterm goal of destabilizing Russia.. Also NATOs easter expansion against promises to the contrary. The Coup in #Ukraine and the attept in #Belarussia

This from a Progressive Democrat who served as VP,  Cabinet official  under Presidents #Roosevelt and #Truman. He called out #AmericanFascism. The #putinsplaybook version exported into #Poland, #Hungary, #Belarus, #Ukraine, adopted by Trumpist America is #ChristianFascism. 
❗Armed conflict in eastern #Ukraine made youngsters like Liuba not only lose their homes &amp; #schools🏠, but also their chance for a happy childhood. Over the last 3 years, at least 118 attacks on schools have been reported, five of which in 2021 alone 👉

The Board of the National Bank of #Ukraine decided to increase the base rate up to 8% p.a, according to the central bank's website.  It notes that amid "significant increase in fundamental inflationary pressure" such a decision is necessary to keep inflation within 5% in 2022. 
#Ukraine-#Hungary Commission on National Minorities to meet on Sept 16 
@motytchak @tashecon It appeals to that "critical parent" approach to #Ukraine which is a standard of western discourse and I encounter regularly-
The Foreign Ministry of #Russia said it expects an impartial and non-politicized attitude from the European Court of #HumanRights (ECHR) in the face of the complaint filed by Russia against #Ukraine. 
#NordStream2 News. US/Germany strike deal to stop Russia using pipeline as leverage. Sanctions envisaged if Putin tries to blackmail #Ukraine. Ukraine gets $50m in green energy technology credits &amp; guarantee of repayment for transit fees lost through 2024 
#Ukraine was a pawn

Court obliges State Bureau of Investigations of #Ukraine to look into @Zelensky's possible #hightreason
It’s official. #NordStream2 will be finished.   US and #Germany reached an agreement on finishing the pipeline without US imposing sanctions while #Ukraine is expected to lose $3bn in transit fees. 1/2
