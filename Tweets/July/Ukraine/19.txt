@ChristopherJM Sounds like #Nordstream 2 is a done deal and will go live soon. I wonder if more #US #taxpayers $$$ will be wasted on #Ukraine. More and more opportunities will be created for #CORRUPTION. I don't mind if #Biden will invest his personal $, but not tax payers.
@I_Katchanovski So #Ukraine's Supreme Court is no longer has a final word? This is insane to investigate a decision by the Supreme Court of Ukraine. #Zelensky authority is crossing all legal rules. Nobody is complaining from #EU, #US. Mr. #Kent is in Ukraine... Silence
@I_Katchanovski What does it mean for #Ukraine, #USA, #Germany, #EU, #Russia? Will it mean for #US #taxpayers &amp; #Germans to pay more for Ukrainians? If that's a case, I am totally against it.  #Biden can invest on own $$$ into energy sector of Ukraine, but ordinary taxpayers shouldn't
