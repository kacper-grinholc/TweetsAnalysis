Indeed somewhat surprising in the twenty-first century and with so many women experts on #Ukraine what a shame. 
Restoring the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine without "Crimea under the Ukrainian flag' is impossible. The Minsk accords will destroy #Ukraine statehood and provoke a real civil war throughout the country. 
It seems that there are still no clear agreements or steps confirmed by both sides to minimize the military and financial threats to #Ukraine from the #NordStream2 commissioning... #Germany 
A lot of people are special needs in the Ukraine. I have no idea what people will do there as Russians, Poles, and Jewish people live there too.  #Ukraine #Poland #Israel
On Putin's article on #Ukraine. It was published in two languages: Russian &amp; Ukrainian. 1st version is addressed to RU-speaking Ukrainians &amp; Russians. 2nd one is a reproach to UA: unlike you, we respect Ukr-speaking Ukrainians &amp; have translated the text especially for them 1/14

#Ukraine enters a new stage of fight for its independence. While German &amp; French "leaders" are selling everything to their top client Vova Putin, the ill-famous clown #Zelenskyy keeps attacking Ukraine from within.

"#Putin the Kremlin Maniac accepted #Russia's loss of Caucusus Region, Central Asia; Russia's role of China's helpless hostage in the Far East; but declared total war to Ukrainians and Belarusians instead": emigre RU pundit Piontkovsky on the Putin's fresh #Ukraine manifesto. 
A more accurate translation would be “one people”.  Nevertheless, keep an eye on this space. #Ukraine #russia 
#Zelensky invites #Sandu to join festivities timed to 30th anniversary of #Ukraine's independence
Germany continues to support #Ukraine in the implementation of the Minsk agreement and pledges 1.5 million #vaccine doses to Ukraine in the fight against the #COVID19 pandemic. - Chancellor #Merkel receives Ukrainian President #Selensky in Berlin. 
#Germany to pass #Ukraine 1.5 million doses of vaccine, - #Merkel
#Putin compares the persecution of #Russians in #Ukraine to the use of weapons of mass destruction

🇷🇺⚡🇺🇦 Putin: in Ukraine today we are talking about a forced change of national identity, but the most disgusting thing is that Russians in #Ukraine are forced not only to renounce their roots, but also to believe that #Russia is their enemy
Why #Putin 's  'article' today and why he mentions #Germany and #Austria? Probably because of #Zelensky visit to #Berlin today. So #Merkel will be able to say: look, #Putin is still planning to invade you, so be more cooperative or we'll not be able to help you, #Ukraine

The first season he will try to find love in #Ukraine. Why in Ukraine? Ukraine, among other things, is famous for very #beautiful ladies. Ukraine is a post-Soviet country with a completely different mentality in comparison to #America.
I'm more concerned about the official #Ukraine narrative. Than millions of valid tweets, refuting Putin's/Russia's claims about Ukraine!  If Zelenskyy doesn't get this right about Ukraine. The alternative is obvious. Ukraine has to explain it properly!!! I have little faith in Z
President of #Ukraine keeps saying that the damage from #NordStream2 will be of not only economic, but also security nature - Press Secretary — Official website of the President of Ukraine:  #Germany
President Volodymyr #Zelenskyy and the Federal President of #Germany discussed the progress in implementing reforms in #Ukraine — Official website of the President of Ukraine:  #Steinmeier
@FrancesRobles @BLSchmitt There's only so much soviet-style misery people can take. Just ask #Ukraine.🇺🇦
An opportunity for Ukraine to set the record straight on it's history for the world to see. Will the Ukrainian government do it justice and refute Russia's revanchist claims to #Ukraine?  Or will they follow the "Little Russian" narrative that Russian's loves to insist?
This is apparently famous #Ukraine "Peace Plan" that @nytimes &amp; other US media &amp; politicians turned into a  central element of #Russiagate. This Ostap Bender, aka the Onion, kind of plan was presented as real by US media &amp; politicians.  
European Council extends its sanctions on Russia for another 6 months #EuropeanCouncil #Russia #sanction #Ukraine  
In other words, #Russia consistently REFUSES to peacefully coexist with the free #Ukraine nation, regardless of costs and risks. 
#Putin's fresh "#Ukraine sovereignty" manifesto is entirely consistent with his decades-long obsession about destroying Ukrainian statehood, identity &amp; historical memory. It's a pledge to continue #Russia policy of war crimes, brainwashing and aggressive historical revisionism.

#Russia's president Putin published an article about history and relations between #Ukraine and Russia, available in both Russian and Ukrainian.  The article is riddled with historic inaccuracies and provides ideological basis for Kremlin's chauvinism  1/x
When all other options are exhausted (including conflict proliferation, sabotage and propaganda), it is finally time to turn to the people! Perhaps, the West is not buying "lemme tell you how it is" any longer 🤔 #Russia #Ukraine 
@ACEurasia Thanks for great discussion! #Ukraine Stay positive.
We call @OSCE_SMM for a comprehensive monitoring not only in #Donbass, but also in the rest of #Ukraine. It should be conducted without any misbalances in reporting – manifestations of aggressive nationalism, neo-Nazism and xenophobia should not be disregarded 
Political will for result-oriented dialogue by sides – Kiev, Donetsk and Lugansk – crucial for solving conflict in East #Ukraine. Still no such will in Kiev. Progress is needed – both SpecRep on Ukraine H.Grau and @OSCE_SMM Chief H.Cevik stressed it in OSCE Perm.Council on 8 July 
Each day that #Ukraine authorities evade direct dialogue with the representatives of Donetsk and Lugansk brings more suffering to people of #Donbass. Inconclusive meetings of the TCG and its working groups on 6-7 July are quite showing in this regard 
So I guess ole Joe is gonna fly in to intimidate the committee which just voted to Audit #PA  2020 Fraudulent #Election just like He did with #Ukraine

Ein Volk, ein Reich... short retelling of Putin's article about #Ukraine 🙈
#EU extends #sanctions against #Russia over #Ukraine 
Where is Crimea, and is it a country?  The Republic of Crimea is not a sovereign country. Crimea is a peninsula that is located to the south of Ukraine between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.  Have a look at the link #Crimea #Ukraine 
Putin latest article claiming #Ukraine a subordinate component of 🇷🇺 imperial project highlights failure of Western Russia analysts 2000-2021 (esp. Graham, Mearsheimer, Walt, Cohen et al.) For Moscow, 2004 Orange Revolution, 2014  *always* crux of Moscow atavistic revanche. 
It is time to recognize that the #Minsk process is brain dead. As long as Putin is in power, he can only lead nowhere. In #Ukraine as in #Belarus, the Kremlin's expansionist rhetoric must be opposed by an unshakeable principle: the will of the people to live free and independent.
