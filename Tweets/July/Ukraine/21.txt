Oooh, interesting move from #Ukraine over #NordStream2: 
#NordStream2: Joint Statement of the US and Germany on Support for #Ukraine, European Energy Security, and our Climate Goals 
The agreement between #US &amp; #Germany on Russia's Nord Stream 2 stipulates that Berlin will seek EU sanctions &amp; implement its own if #Russia uses the pipeline to put pressure on #Ukraine.  They also agreed to seek an extension of the contract for the transit of 🇷🇺 gas through 🇺🇦. 
The deal provides #Germany with long-sought-after access to expanded energy supplies and allows #Russia to double deliveries of natural gas directly to the country, bypassing an existing route through #Ukraine, which has opposed the pipeline. #NordStream2
US #Germany deal concerning #NordStream2 &amp; #Ukraine is even called "Joint Statement." 
With Normandy dead &amp; a bleeding economy, Ukraine is left alone against a warmongering Russia.  On July 12, #Putin has authored an article denying #Ukraine of statehood &amp; nationhood.  We’re stuck in a viscous cycle of European appeasement &amp; we’re yet to pay the price. /END

Thread: #Ukraine's view of "4-point deal on #NordStream2. "In the middle of the cold winter w working NS2, when RU will cut transit via UA (as it did before as part of its energy war &gt; Jan. 1st, 2009) no one sane in Germany will sanction/cut NS2." I totally agree with @Liveuamap 
The U.S. and Germany will act against Russia if it uses the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to harm Ukraine or other Eastern European countries, according to sources familiar with a bilateral agreement.  #Pipeline #NordStream2 #Russia #Germany #Ukraine #GasPipe
Every time when someone whines about how #Russia "mUsT pRoMiSe" to continue gas transits through #Ukraine, remind them of how Ukraine has been carrying out ukrainization and waging war against Russian language and culture for years, killing ppl in Donbass.
Wait, so we ask #Ukraine to bend over for USA/#RUSSIA so we can pass #Nordstream; but hey, here’s some #Moderna vax.  You know - the ones Walmart pharm told me they stopped bc of adverse reactions.  - Now, everybody sing along, “Kumbaya ma Lord...”
