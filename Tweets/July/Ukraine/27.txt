In my @ACEurasia @AtlanticCouncil article, I argue how #Russian President #VladimirPutin relies on distractions caused by sporting events to meddle abroad. Could he be using the #TokyoOlympics as an opportunity to launch a new incursion into #Ukraine? 
Today in 2002-at an air show at Lviv, #Ukraine-a Sukhoi Su-27 fighter crashed during an aerobatics presentation, killing 77 (including 28 children) and injuring more than 500 others, making it the deadliest air show disaster in history. The pilots survived with minor injuries.

Year ago #OTD, #Ukraine President #Zelensky agreed to a "Grand Ceasefire" with #Russia in the #Donbas war. The "ceasefire" soon turned to be an overtly UNILATERAL one (on UA part only). Acc. to @Novynarnia count, it cost Ukraine 60 soldiers killed &amp; 159+ wounded (Apr'21: 14 KIA).
The gas transit via Ukraine after 2024 will depend on the additional volumes purchased from Gazprom by #EU traders. ❗This confirms that #Ukraine’s fears of #Gazprom’s use of gas as a geopolitical weapon against Kyiv and Europe are true.

In #Ukraine, street art is an essential part of the urban art landscape. It is crucial to giving the public a voice.   Check out our video on @insightconflict for a tour of the best murals with peace messages in Kyiv. 
@Brodsky_Prav @Alexey__Kovalev @KevinRothrock @andersostlund And I frankly wonder at the brass neck of people whose country is attacking #Ukraine and venture to denigrate Ukrainians while their troops murder Ukrainians.

#Facebook post of a #Ukraine journalist arguing that the #Russia state "church" "baptism commemoration event" is political &amp; has nothing to do with religion was blocked WITHIN 15 MINUTES - which was the 1st time ever her posts were blocked. Coincidence?
The more #Ukraine state procrastinates the inevitable crackdown on the #Russia state "church", the more subversive and dangerous the "church" gets. Jihadis in the West blow up or stab people, Kremlin's "Christians" in Ukraine PURPOSELY mass-infect people and promote #antivaxx.
