#WhatsNewInWashington: #US and #Germany reached an agreement on #NordStream2, with Germany pledging to sanction Russia if it threatens the energy security of #Ukraine.  Many called the deal insufficient and argued the pipeline is a geopolitical weapon. What do you think? 
#Russia Army's mortars and anti-air guns spotted in immediate residential areas in occupied #Donbas #Ukraine (including, in Donetsk City's bedroom neighborhoods): #OSCE SMM's report of Jul 24.
I am more worried about #Ukraine's tendency to lean on BJ because of this incident. BJ  by attempting to purchase one of the ‘crown jewels’ of Ukraine’s military-industrial complex inherited from the former USSR. Motor Sich  the company's advanced engine, is the dream of Beijing

With all due respect to the author of the thread, not being a Zelensky fan, Big Construction doesn't touch city or regional roads. It applies only to national highways. I won't comment on #Kyiv roads bc of the decent words lack. This is Klitschko's responsibility. #Ukraine

#Ukraine Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova, an incompetent political appointee of President Zelensky, has been extensively exposed both of corruption/procedural arbitrariness and of bias against activists &amp; patriots (and in favor of a notorious pro-Russia powerbroker Portnov).
Thread from an excellent source on #NS2 #Ukraine 
Gunduz Mamedov, #Ukraine prosecutor who was in charge of investigating crimes in the course of the RU invasion, resigns from PGO, citing "systematic blocking pressure by [the Prosecutor Gen. Venediktova] resulting in loss of his procedural independence".

The @GasTSOua has welcomed the Parliament’s decision to support draft laws to stimulate the development of #greentransport in #Ukraine, in particular the use of #compressednaturalgas as a transitional fuel.
To date, an “elegant” solution to cover the budget shortfall has been found: the National Bank of #Ukraine carries out UAH issues, refinances state-owned banks (long-term loans at 6-8%). Banks buy government bonds (10-11%). NBU gets bonds as security for a loan. 
✅ As per the Council of the EU's recommendation, #Luxembourg has updated its list of third countries exempted from current temporary entry restrictions. #Ukraine has been added to the list of exemptions.  💡 All details available here👇
