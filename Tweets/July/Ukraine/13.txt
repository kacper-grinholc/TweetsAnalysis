NEW- Although state media are making heavy play out of it, #Putin's fiery rhetoric does not exist in a Kremlin propaganda vacuum. Instead, it likely portends Russian military escalation against #Ukraine. We can make that assessment based on two factors. 
After an Op-Ed published on the #Kremlin website regarding #Ukraine in Ukrainian, #Putin then gives a response to a few follow-up questions to an unknown interlocutor in St Petersburg (video)

BRKNG: resignation of #Ukraine's Interior Minister #Avakov was tendered on President #Zelensky's insistence, who reportedly suggests a ruling party MP &amp; Avakov's protege Denys Monastyrskyi as the Minister candidate: media citing MPs.
Denis Monastyrsky as the new minister for Internal affairs means that cybercrime most likely will get much more attention than before. #Ukraine
Plot thickens/ed in #Ukraine. 
The Minister of Internal Affairs of #Ukraine resigned at his own request.  President Zelensky offers Denis Monastyrsky for this position. 
🤥#Putin has released the promised article on the "historic unity of Ukrainians and Russians" or rather a compilation of the #Kremlin’s old propagandistic narratives denying #Ukraine’s right to independence. We analyzed them in an article of our own:
Pakistan’s #Covid19 management strategy focuses strongly on mass vaccination. 🇵🇰 is committed to achieving its vaccination targets and inoculation of 20m ppl is a vital milestone. #Getvaccinated @OfficialNcoc #Pakistan  #Ukraine 
🇵🇰 will continue to support its #Kashmiri brethren in their just struggle against Indian oppression till the realization of their inalienable right to self-determination as enshrined in the relevant 🇺🇳 United Nations Security Council Resolutions. #Pakistan  #Ukraine 
Their courage galvanized an unparalleled struggle for self-determination that continues till date. #Pakistan  #Ukraine 
Today #Ukraine could have legalised medical #marijuana. But the parliament failed to support the bill. It’s a shame that politicians continue to manipulate and spread lies about medical marijuana while thousands of sick people need this treatment!
#Avakov resignation in #Ukraine is arguably as important in Europe as the #Merkel succession. Germany might be a huge global economy, but Merkel couldn't even dream of such an INFORMAL LASTING influence on THIS many untransparent men/institutions with guns and battle experience.
Parliament fails to approve #legalization of #cannabis in #Ukraine
TECTONIC political change in #Ukraine as the mighty Interior Minister @AvakovArsen tenders his resignation. The man had been more influential than the President (let alone the Prime Ministers). Deep barely-predictable consequences for the entire Europe subcontinent to follow.

This is also why Zelensky's win in the 2019 presidential election was good for #Ukraine, even if our assessment of his presidency is ultimately quite critical. Regularly changing leaders is a defense against authoritarian rule and, to a lesser degree, corruption.
This is, I would argue, one of the overlooked positive features of #Ukraine's politics. There is plenty of corruption, loads of lobbying, rampant irresponsibility, but even "untouchables" are not "untouchable" in reality. Sooner or later, their time comes. 
In #Ukraine, interior minister Avakov, a political heavyweight in the government, resigned today:    
People laughing at #Ukraine's lackluster rebuttal to Putin degrading Ukrainian's to nothing. Will show up in the history books.  His false statements on Ukraine will remain if Zelenskyy government doesn't refute it. Tell the world about Ukraine right.  Win with the pen. Or die.

‘Impartiality’ of Russia? All answers- in the article of #Putin ‘On the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians’: true sovereignty of #Ukraine is possible in partnership with #Russia, Ukraine is Russia’s ‘historic territory’, Kiev simply does not need #Donbass. 
If Arsen Avakov’s resignation gets approved by the parliament, can #Ukraine get a day off, @ZelenskyyUa? Much like England wanted a day off if they were to win the Euros!   This is an event of a bigger significance for the country, definitely.

In my article for the @TheWilsonCenter's @kennaninstitute, I argue how #Germany should compensate #Poland and #Ukraine for its #NordStream2 project, and how #CentralEurope and #EasternEurope should prepare for this potentially operational pipeline: 
All countries must put pressure on #Russia to hold a meeting in the #NormandyFour format to establish peace in #Ukraine - President #Zelensky : 
Great pleasure today to have one-to-one lunch with Vice-Prime Minister of #Ukraine @StefanishynaO to discuss notably @NATO &amp; #EU agenda We must learn to see Ukraine -an European country- as such and not in relation to #Russia. The two countries have nothing to do with each other. 
Volodymyr #Zelenskyy: #NordStream2 should be considered in the format of the #NormandyFour, because this is an issue of security in #Ukraine — Official website of the President of Ukraine:

So #Putin wrote a huge article arguing that Ukrainians and Russians are the same nation. Well, yet another proof that #Russia will never respect #Ukraine’s sovereignty, regardless of what they say during the negotiations.
