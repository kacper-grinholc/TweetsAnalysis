🇷🇺V.#Putin: "#Russia is open to dialogue with #Ukraine &amp; ready to discuss the most complex issues. It is important for us to understand that our partner is defending its national interests but not serving someone else's &amp; is not a tool in someone else's hands to fight against us"  
This so-called essay is the apogee of #Putin and his brothers-in-arms obsession with #Ukraine. In addition, this is an absolutely arrogant cynical distortion of history and uncovered territorial claims.  #Russia

Putin's article does read like a manifesto. @MarkGaleotti offers more reassuring view in his latest podcast. I recommend it too, but I am more worried. #Ukraine

Russian President Putin has finally published his hotly-anticipated essay on the “historical unity” of Russians and Ukrainians, and it did not disappoint. The Russian leader’s article reads like a justification for an even larger war. #Russia #Ukraine

If there was a proper collection process for unpaid utility bills in Ukraine and tenants who failed to pay were evicted the payment morale would go up. Then it would also be possible to separate those who actually need social benefits from those who just skip paying.  #Ukraine
#US-#Germany tensions over #NordStream2: #Merkel, meeting with #Biden, may hope to get away with providing guarantees for #Ukraine’s continued role as a gas transit country and a vague snapback mechanism that would kick in if #Russia seeks to cut transit through Ukraine.
This is partly nonsense. There is no collection of unpaid bills. The utility companies put a bunch of stickers on apartment doors and randomly cut water or heat for an entire apartment block. But there are no evictions. Probably because the authorities don't dare. #Ukraine
