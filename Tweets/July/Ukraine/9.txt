@ChristopherJM Why did this conference on #Ukraine's #reforms took place in #Vilnius #Lithuania? Can you imagine a conference about domestic reforms of #USA will take place let's say in Peru or Argentina? I think even guys don't know how to progress reforms without corruptions, lawsuits, etc
Can you provide a short list of at least five fantastic women from #Ukraine who know lots of info &amp; full of ideas how to move forward #reforms in Ukraine? I think even men don't know it. I question why in the world Conference re Ukraine reforms took place in #Vilnius #Lithuania?
