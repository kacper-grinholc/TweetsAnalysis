As here in the #Carpathians, many resorts in #Ukraine are currently facing quite unusual contrasts. Reasons for the 🇺🇦 boom of well-off tourists from the Arabian Peninsula: visa-free regimes since 2020, new direct flight connections and, above all, the #EU's #COVID entry bans. 
First, Russia is looking forward to the completion of #NS2 so as to have an open path to further destabilize #Ukraine and wage #hybrid warfare in the region. Second, the Kremlin may one day use this Russia-to-Germany gas link as a means of blackmail. 2/2

#Lukashevich: Russian Federation has lodged an inter-state application against #Ukraine to the ECHR. At a time when Kiev revels in complete impunity amid inaction of international organizations, the timeliness of this step is obvious 
#Lukashevich: Since the unconstitutional coup on the Maidan in 2014, the situation in #Ukraine has deteriorated even more. Total ukrainization of education and media, persecution of journalists, as well as the water blockade of Crimea - the list is endless 
#Lukashevich: This is happening amid the efforts of #Ukraine authorities to rewrite history and actively condone neo-Nazism. Whitewashing and glorification of Nazism and Nazi accomplices takes place. Right-wing radical organizations feel at ease 
New research from #Ukraine on violence against women's rights activists throughout the country, including a number of incidents w/ women politicians. A total of 53 reported incidents in the 1st 1/2 of 2021, just think of how many go unreported! #VAWIP 🇺🇦♀️ 
#CrimeanTatar political prisoner serving 19-year sentence suffers stroke in #Russia prison #FreeInverBekirov #FreeKuku #LetMyPeopleGo #Ukraine 
#Lukashevich: Human rights situation in #Ukraine remains extremely difficult, with no prospects for improvement. Human rights and freedoms continue to be systematically violated in this OSCE participating State with the connivance of the authorities
