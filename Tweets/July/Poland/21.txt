Honestly so gutted for those athletes. Having been a swimmer I can only imagine how bad they must feel. It does make me wonder if there is genuinely a legal case in this too? Especially with the ISL teams generating income for swimmers now… #Poland #swimming #Tokyo2020
Absolutely astounding from the Polish swimming organisation - how the hell can you not register 6 athletes and effectively send 6 too many who now have to be sent home? 1 athlete would be shocking but mistakes can happen. But 6?! #Poland #swimming
The European Commission warned Poland it could be fined if failing to comply with decisions by the European Court of Justice over judicial independence as well as corruption but was ignored #corruption #Poland
