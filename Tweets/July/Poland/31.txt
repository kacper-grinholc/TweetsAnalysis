Well done #Poland.
Tomorrow #Poland🇵🇱 marks the 77th anniversary of the #WarsawUprising, an incredible two month struggle for liberation of #Warsaw. A symbol of Polish bravery, &amp; everlasting love &amp; strive for freedom. Sympathies with all my Polish friends wherever you are: for your freedom &amp; ours. 
In Poland I trust  In 2020 #Poland was the 22nd biggest exporter. +10 places since 2001 (1.5% of global exports vs. 0.4%). It overtook Turkey and Brazil for instance. 
On the eve of the 77th anniversary of the #WarsawUprising, @AmbWilczek honors those who paid the ultimate price for #Poland's freedom and independence. 🇵🇱  Watch the Ambassador's remarks below. ⤵️

2000 was 6 golds and although less total medals than in 1988, a higher 14th place finish in the table. In 2004 #Poland fell to 10 medals (3 golds) and finished 23rd, out of the top 20 for the first time since 1948.
In contrast, #Poland 🇵🇱 has experienced a much gentler decline after the fall of communism. #POL also improved during the 50s, but then had its best period in the 60s and 70s already. 1960-80, always a top 10 finish except once (11th in 1968) and always 20+ medals but once (18).
