#Russia 🇷🇺 is seeking to expand its already prominent influence in Central Asia to both #Pakistan 🇵🇰 and #Afghanistan 🇦🇫 in an effort to shore up new partnerships.  Comments from today seem to show they're willing to undercut Kabul today to have influence in the Kabul of tomorrow
Developing story:  As Kabulov exemplifies the pivot toward #Pakistan 🇵🇰 in the ongoing conversation re: #Afghanistan 🇦🇫 it appears #Russia 🇷🇺 is hedging its bets on the peace process.

"The only realistic spoiler in this scenario is India because it hitherto thus far refuses to enter into public contact with the Taliban; which in turn excludes it from the Extended Troika format of America, #China, #Pakistan, &amp; #Russia in #Afghanistan..."

#Taliban is drawing mileage from engaging with #Russia &amp; #China. It has taken #Pakistan for granted and seems to have decided to keep #TTP as its blackmailing card. @husainhaqqani

#Russia 🇷🇺 and #Portugal 🇵🇹 held talks on bilateral cooperation.   Portugal has a relatively moderate position on Russia, in spite of its consistent support for #Ukraine 🇺🇦 related sanctions.

@Sassywagi @HermelaBrook @PowerUSAID #China #Russia @_AfricanUnion #Turkey Ethiopians aren’t willing to reverse their revolution as lead by @AbiyAhmedAli ! The West is undermining and thrashing the voice of 💯 million Ethiopians, for just we’re #Negros ! @UN don’t be cruel to see the worst humanitarian crisis ever!
The #USAirForce’s 2nd attempt to conduct the flight test of a #hypersonic weapon proved to be a dud. The two successive failures explain why the #US military is lagging in harnessing hypersonic technology while #Russia &amp; #China zoom ahead.

Of course, the disinformation campaign was also largely designed to give an air of legitimacy when #Russia hacked #Pennsylvania, #Michigan, and #Wisconsin. But again -- look how THAT'S worked out for five years. 
@___lor__ @lacadri34 @DanRather JFC more #ActiveMeasures courtesy of #Russia. This is as infuriating as it is horrifying. The West is being attacked relentlessly &amp; our enemies are going for "death by 1000 cuts" in order to bleed us out. They want us sick/dead &amp; consumed with fighting each other.
