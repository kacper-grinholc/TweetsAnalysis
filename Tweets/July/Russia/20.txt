“#Germany &amp;  the U.S... would try to ensure that #Ukraine continues to receive roughly $3B in annual transit fees that #Russia pays under its current agreement with Kyiv, which runs through 2024. Officials didn’t explain how to ensure that Russia continues to make the payments.”
“[Germany] rejected a U.S. demand to include a... kill-switch clause [that] would have enabled Berlin to suspend #gas flows if #Russia were to make aggressive moves toward its neighbors or Western allies. [Germany] argued that... could be the target of a legal challenge.”🤔
#US completed #GreenCard #lottery for 2022 year. People from #Russia had won 6,001 green cards. Same number of citizens from #Uzbekistan will be able to come to #USA in 2022. 4,495 green cards were won in #Ukraine. Just slightly over 2,000 green cards were awarded for #Armenia.
The revelation of good relations with #Germany &amp; possible relations with #Russia is a positive outcome of what could have been worldwide tensions instead. Highly commend @POTUS @JoeBiden &amp; @VP @KamalaHarris on this peaceful, Diplomatic initiative!

The “tech war” ≠ competition of technological prowess between China &amp; #uspoli, but an attempt by the U.S to strangle China’s(&amp; #Russia) tech advance by denying it access to technology. Not working👇. In 1976 China=poorest nation on earth. #cdnpoli

@Biz_Ukraine_Mag When former USSR republics declared independence - no one even said a word (well, there've been many whispers behind the curtains that helped the process).  When #Crimea did EXACTLY the same all of the sudden "#Russia occupied #Ukrain"! Ohh, the hypocrisy!  #idiots
No surprise that searching her timeline for #Cuba, #Venezuela, #Iran, #Russia, #China, etc. shows nothing but regime propaganda. No human rights advocacy from this self-proclaimed "Advocate for human rights."   Yet searching #Israel reveals a hostile obsession with the country. 
Good news for @Apple users - #Russia’s Mir payment system can now be used in #ApplePay.
