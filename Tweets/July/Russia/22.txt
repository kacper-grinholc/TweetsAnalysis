@dkaleniuk @ChristopherJM It's a failed foreign policy of #Zelensky. Instead of direct talks with #Russia (hate or not), Zelensky relied on foreigners to resolve Ukrainian issues. Big mistake. It's funny to watch how Ukrainians are telling Americans that America is not back. US is back for Americans!
@Lala43463561 That is how they have been "re-constructing" their fake history under the supervision of the Bigger West and #Russia.

@ChristopherJM Olga is repeating radical view of nationalists in #Ukraine. She is missing several points. Ukraine failed to have own foreign policy, failed to held direct talks with #Russia about gas pipeline, transit fees. Instead, #Zelensky relied on #EU, #Germany, #USA. Huge mistake!

@olgatokariuk #Poroshenko &amp; now #Zelensky is repeating same mistakes that will cost dearly to #Ukraine and ordinary Ukrainians. Instead of relying on own policies &amp; have direct talks with #Russia, Ukraine relied on #EU, #Germany &amp; #US to solve own issues. Blame Ukrainian leadership, diplomats.
