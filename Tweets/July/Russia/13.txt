#EU should not treat the cases of #Belarus and #Russia as one, but build a separate strategy for each country (inkl. sanctions vs. dialogue options). At the same time: it is unlikely to influence Lukashenka regime without involving Russia / taking into account RU perspective
@mjheiser @patriottakes Massive sophisticated psyop out of #Russia aimed at dividing and debilitating our people.

In lengthy article, #Putin says "#Russia has never been and will never be anti-#Ukraine‚Äú and suggests they should have relationship similar to US and Canada.  It might help if Russia did not occupy Crimea and conduct conflict in Donbas that has claimed some 14,000 lives.

What can push #Russia to talk to the West about #Belarus? 1. Too high economic costs for supporting BY  2. Alternative pro-Russian political forces in BY  3. Mistakes by Lukashenka (like RyanAir)  4. Constitutional referendum in BY  5. New mass protests in BY + split in elites
#Russia will most probably never talk to pro-democratic forces in excile - instead it could search for contacts with the #Belarus ian elites to push for a controlled regime change if needed.
