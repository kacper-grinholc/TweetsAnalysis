#Ransomware, as we have seen with #Russia’s groups who did the Solar Winds and Colonial pipeline hack, offers plausible deniability while still administering devastating effects.  Imagine an economy or country shut down due to perpetual infrastructure and economic sieges…
As conflict and competing evolves, especially between great powers like #Russia, #China, #Iran and the US, consider how dangerous it is to actually escalate into open war.  #Ransomware and cyber attacks are now a mainstream tool and we need to be better prepared.
"#Afghan government, behind the scenes, is welcoming #China immediately after saying goodbye 2 #America.  China has been keen on extending its #BRI 2 #Afghanistan, &amp; has been asking #Kabul 2 join it 4 half a decade."  #Russia &amp; #USA tried. Good luck...

This is not good at all, diplomatic immunity is one of the few international norms that almost every  country agrees on AND obeys. What #Russia is doing is very very dangerous and just plain stupid

FM #Lavrov: Developing ties with #ASEAN is one of #Russia’s #foreignpolicy priorities in the Asia-Pacific. We consistently support strengthening of the organisation’s role in the region. 
#Russia and #China both use troll armies to spread disinformation, though their methods vary. China's control of information about #COVID19, down to individual prohibited words or phrases, contrasts with Russian flooding along the entire spectrum of truth. 
We have repeatedly said many times tht after the withdrawal of #US &amp; their allies from #Afghanistan, the development of the situation in this country is a matter of our heightened concern - #Peskov! #Russia monitoring it very closely! Wat does it mean? Russia the saviour of afgan

#Russia hasn't waited 48 hours to start fucking around near Afghanistan - talking about "supporting border security"...  @BaddCompani @MingGao26 
Shocking in 21st Cent a brutal dictator like Assad in #Syria would dare undertake another medieval siege in #Daraa with allies #Russia #Iran when kept afloat by UN aid and @antonioguterres @UNReliefChief remain silent+not threatening suspension of ALL aid if siege not lifted? 
#Russia to 'eliminate' #US $ in business transactions?! #Russia announced they completed necessary exchange operations for eliminating the #US #Dollar currency from the National #Wealth #Fund which holds part of the country's #oil revenues. It's still a puzzle how they will do it 
#Russia already has military base near Dushanbe. I count that Moscow involvement could come only if #Tajikistan get attacked directly which won't happen at present time #Afganistan #kabul #taliban

Strong recovery in economy related to #coronavirus #vaccinations &amp; openings or #SaudiArabia &amp; #Russia having a little fun in trying to get their atrocity supporter back?  #oil #gasoline   I think former, like lumber &amp; steel, a lot of issues ramping back from slowdowns.

Tonight is #Kupala / Kupalle festival in eastern Slavic lands in #Belarus, #Ukraine and parts of #Russia.  An ancient pagan celebration which still survives after 1,000 years of Christianisation:   
"The economy of the Russian Federation, all its entities and municipalities must be prepared to provide protection against armed attack and meet the needs of the state and the population in wartime,"  #Russia #NATO #Ukraine

If #Russia vetoes extension of cross-border aid into NW #Syria = Putin starvation strategy &amp; would literally condemn hundreds of thousands to death esp children as 3 million dependent on aid as  Ireland+Norway press for extension in UN Security Council - 
In 4 days, x-border aid into NW #Syria expires. @UN #SecurityCouncil must vote to renew but #Russia keeps weaponizing aid to leverage its interests.   And 4 million #Syrians pay the price.  Check out my analysis for @HarvardJMEPP on this deja vu feeling.
