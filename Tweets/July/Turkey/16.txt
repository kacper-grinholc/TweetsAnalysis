According to the Health Ministry, #Turkey on Wednesday recorded 5,496 new infections and 45 daily deaths.
According to Health Ministry data, #Turkey has administered more than 49 million doses so far. More than 15 million people have received both of their shots.
Koca's latest announcement comes amid significant recent momentum in #Turkey's #vaccination campaign. After suffering a slowdown in vaccination figures due to unexpected delays in shipments of doses, Turkey has significantly increased the reach and the speed of the campaign.
The minister also announced several changes to #Turkey's vaccination campaign, including shortening the period between doses and how soon a person who tested positive for #COVID can receive a jab.
Health care workers and people aged 50 and above will be eligible for a third dose of a coronavirus vaccine in #Turkey starting tomorrow, Health Minister #FahrettinKoca said on Wednesday.
