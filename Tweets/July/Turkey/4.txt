🇹🇷🇺🇲| According to Jerusalem Post, the US will be monitoring #Erdogan's human rights record and foreign policy, and punishing him accordingly if he deviates from US dictates.  This will ensure #Turkey remains an obedient and productive #NATO member.

Thousands Kurds and friends protest German Government - Turkish dictatorship arms deal.  Germany still sell arms to #Turkey and its army. Gearmna weapons are being used in crimes against humanity or end up in hands of islamist terrorists in Syria&amp;Kurdistan  
There is a reason why a political refugee from #Turkey like @candundaradasi is a @Foreign_Cat. He knows how totalitarianism starts. While #Spain has championed #LGBTQ rights, it is archaic in its response to the #Independència movement given a politicized judiciary.

Emperor Theodosius II, age 13, yielded power OTD in 414 to his older sister Aelia Pulcheria, who reigned as regent and proclaimed herself empress (or Augusta) of the Eastern Roman Empire  #travel #Turkey #history
Well, is it really shocking? NOT really! We have been watching many EU officials not only not advocating for #HumanRights but also supporting dictatorial and human rights abusive countries like #Azerbaijan and #Turkey.  Let's admit it: #EndOfHumanity

#Turkey, #Greece and #Cyprus  assisted #Israel in the #MountCarmel fire in 2010. It’s beyond politics, that’s what friends are for. 
@Prof_TGSchulze @MarcelVR1 @govern In #Turkey, the gov’t is staging mafia hits, attacking women’s rights, desecrating the Hagia Sophia, beating LGBT people, arresting journos, trafficking Afghan heroin, selling Libyans into slavery, arming terrorists, &amp; seeking nuclear tech. “Most likely?” 
#Turkey's strategy is to bargain away the #Syrian fighters it transferred to #Libya in a bid to keep the Turkish troops in the country @fehimtastekin 
Hittites are one of the ancient civilizations of ancient Anatolia, founded in 1600 BC. And these people did not disappear all of them mixed with the Turkish people through marriages in Anatolia. Therefore, so the term Anatolian Turks is free to Anatolia 🇹🇷 #Turkey #Turk #Hittites
