#Turkey: opposition leader vows to deport #Syrians if he beats Erdogan 
Well Ashraf Ghani &amp; Afghan Talibans both are Afghans. Occupation was by US &amp; NATO.  Such type of statement by #Erdogan will surely bring his graph further dowm  #Turkey

#Turkey I am disappointed with you. A brotherly advice, stay away from #Afghanistan. It is not #Syria #Libya #Azerbaijan. #Pakistan will not want to choose sides and we believe from day one only Afghans can bring peace to #Afghanistan.
#Turkish President Recep Tayyip #Erdogan does not remember playing his role in #Palestine. Israel is next to Turkey. While the war in Afghanistan is affecting its neighbors and not #Turkey. And Turkey is being affected by the Syrian war, not by #Afghanistan war.
