"Turkey’s ongoing support for Libyan rebels opposed to the internationally recognized government"  What kind of BS is that? #Libya #Turkey 
this 🧵very clearly underlines quite how much shit Dominic Cummings can chat when trying to justify (presumably in his own deluded mind) the lies vote leave used about #Turkey joining the #EU 
@POTUS Here is a question to you; Will you be bringing democracy to #Turkey anytime soon? If no! What is this military buildup in #Dedeağac? Why there are over 400 military tank? And the last question is: Are you a foe or friend of #Turkey

@kevin_snapp @ahval_en It's not in the interest of the #Greek People to see #Turkey dissolve into chaos. The #Turkish state needs to acknowledge that like the many nations of the #British Empire are "better together" within the #UK yet are distinct nations, so is #Turkey.
Most revolutionaries come from broken families with revenge and hatred of societies. #Erdogan, was born and grow up in a poor neighborhood in Istanbul from poor family , was selling watermelon to survive.... end up the dictator of #Turkey... 
Finally I spoke with of the two brothers  in #Tokyo2020 and here is my story about their r journey from #Syria and their experience with #Death_boat from #Turkey to #Greece in 2015 (Ar)
