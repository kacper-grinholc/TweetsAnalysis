#Turkey has administered more than 56 million doses of #COVID19 vaccines since its inoculation campaign began in January 2021. As of Friday, more than 16 million people have had both doses.
Is Turkey in Europe or Asia?  The question of Turkey‚Äôs continental affiliation is an often debated one. It is spread over 302,455 square miles of area and is home to over 79,814,870 people.  Get your answer below #Turkey #population

Last month, the latest batch of #CoronaVac vaccines, a total of 8 million doses, had arrived in #Turkey. The country had signed a deal with the #Chinese company for 100 million doses.
Health Minister #FahrettinKoca had invited the vaccine's developer Sinovac to set up production facilities in #Turkey while the company expressed interest in production.
#CoronaVac was #Turkey‚Äôs first choice for #vaccination against the coronavirus. It was the first jab applied in the country to health care workers during the campaign, which started in January 2021 and later included a #Pfizer-#BioNTech vaccine.
It was already approved for emergency use in 22 countries. #Turkey was among the countries running Phase 3 trials since 2020, along with #Brazil, #Indonesia and #Chile
The vaccine is not studied for efficacy in the long term, nor against emerging variants like delta plus. Participants of the trials were also not diverse. #CoronaVac is among two vaccines in use in #Turkey, along with the #Pfizer-#BioNTech jab.
The interim results of Phase 3 trials in #Turkey for #CoronaVac, an inactive vaccine developed against the coronavirus by #China‚Äôs #Sinovac, show the jab has 83.5% efficacy.
The last stage trials for the #CoronaVac vaccine from #China, conducted with the participation of more than 10,000 people in #Turkey, demonstrated that the jab against the #coronavirus had an efficacy of 83.5%

@KjetilTronvoll @mrubin1971 @AEI Apparently you know nothing about #Ethiopia. We remember how the West blatantly hailed a coup attempt in #Turkey  only to get embarrassed the next morning. A Coup against Ethiopian PM is more foolish even to think about.
"#Turkey breaches #UN arms embargo in #Libya".  Is there any UN Resolution that Turkey hasn't violated?  @antonioguterres @UNSMILibya @francediplo @GermanyDiplo 
This is the classic case of "Ask a thief to guard the case." But moreover involvement of #Turkey in it as @NATO country and protect airport shocks me and just seem like a cheap PR trick of the #HypocriteCountry ,Turkey and also snoop trick of, The Strategist, @KremlinRussia_E 
@JosepBorrellF @RTErdogan Unfortunately today we don't have leaders in #EuropeanUnion like Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet. They would never have made such a statement that seems meaningless. #Turkey is invading #Cyprus once again! #turkishinvasion

In his sobering @haaretzcom piece, "The Truth Behind #Turkey's Sudden Embrace of #Israel," #JacobDayan warns that the change in #Erdoƒüan‚Äôs attitude "will always be only tactical, not strategic" &amp; his hatred does not "come from his head but from his heart."

Sir, there's an enthusiasm in #Pakistan's few religious groups who mistakenly feel that #Talibans r reviving real Islam; #Turkey doesn't see that.  #Erdogan is far clever than any religious leader by being a dictator, how to oblige powerful capitals for own benefit &amp; he did that! 
@StassiStassi @johnwarringtons @TULPAR1453 @FabianLeedsNE In Maratha, Santalaris and Aloda, a massacre by EOKA B killed 126 Turks on 14 August 1974, thus legitimatising #Turkey. #UN described the massacre as a crime against humanity, by saying "constituting a further crime against humanity committed by #Greece and Greek Cypriot gunmen‚Äù.
