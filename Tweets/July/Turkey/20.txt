This report is based on SOHR &amp; x2 anti-#Turkey sources, so probably to be taken with a sizeable grain of salt for now.  Plus, if the US is - as reported - likely to leave behind some small residual force at the airport alongside TSK, I can’t quite seem them working with #SNA.

#Turkey has administered more than 56 million doses of #COVID19 vaccines since its inoculation campaign began in January 2021. As of Friday, more than 16 million people have had both doses.
Is Turkey in Europe or Asia?  The question of Turkey’s continental affiliation is an often debated one. It is spread over 302,455 square miles of area and is home to over 79,814,870 people.  Get your answer below #Turkey #population 
@TheDEWLine …and @BAESystemsAir also helping #Turkey with theirs…
Last month, the latest batch of #CoronaVac vaccines, a total of 8 million doses, had arrived in #Turkey. The country had signed a deal with the #Chinese company for 100 million doses.
Health Minister #FahrettinKoca had invited the vaccine's developer Sinovac to set up production facilities in #Turkey while the company expressed interest in production.
#CoronaVac was #Turkey’s first choice for #vaccination against the coronavirus. It was the first jab applied in the country to health care workers during the campaign, which started in January 2021 and later included a #Pfizer-#BioNTech vaccine.
It was already approved for emergency use in 22 countries. #Turkey was among the countries running Phase 3 trials since 2020, along with #Brazil, #Indonesia and #Chile
The vaccine is not studied for efficacy in the long term, nor against emerging variants like delta plus. Participants of the trials were also not diverse. #CoronaVac is among two vaccines in use in #Turkey, along with the #Pfizer-#BioNTech jab.
The interim results of Phase 3 trials in #Turkey for #CoronaVac, an inactive vaccine developed against the coronavirus by #China’s #Sinovac, show the jab has 83.5% efficacy.
The last stage trials for the #CoronaVac vaccine from #China, conducted with the participation of more than 10,000 people in #Turkey, demonstrated that the jab against the #coronavirus had an efficacy of 83.5%

@KjetilTronvoll @mrubin1971 @AEI Apparently you know nothing about #Ethiopia. We remember how the West blatantly hailed a coup attempt in #Turkey  only to get embarrassed the next morning. A Coup against Ethiopian PM is more foolish even to think about.
"#Turkey breaches #UN arms embargo in #Libya".  Is there any UN Resolution that Turkey hasn't violated?  @antonioguterres @UNSMILibya @francediplo @GermanyDiplo 
This is the classic case of "Ask a thief to guard the case." But moreover involvement of #Turkey in it as @NATO country and protect airport shocks me and just seem like a cheap PR trick of the #HypocriteCountry ,Turkey and also snoop trick of, The Strategist, @KremlinRussia_E 
@JosepBorrellF @RTErdogan Unfortunately today we don't have leaders in #EuropeanUnion like Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet. They would never have made such a statement that seems meaningless. #Turkey is invading #Cyprus once again! #turkishinvasion
#Saudi monarchy crimes in #Arabia, #Yemen, #Lebanon, #Turkey (Khashoggi), #Iraq and #Syria(#ISIS), and betray to #Palestine by new ties with Israel regime...

The EU cannot watch idly while Erdogan is yet again trying to split a 🇪🇺 Member State. #Varosha has to be discussed at #EUCO &amp; there must be consequences.We stand in full solidarity with 🇨🇾 &amp; firmly reject the Turkish position of a two-state solution. #Cyprus is EU,#Turkey is not

Today marks the 47th year of #Turkey’s occupation of Cyprus.  With Ankara growing more emboldened by the day, Armenians reaffirm our solidarity with the people of #Greece &amp; #Cyprus in the face of the existential threat posed by fascist pan-Turkic expansionism. #ΔενΞεχνώ

In his sobering @haaretzcom piece, "The Truth Behind #Turkey's Sudden Embrace of #Israel," #JacobDayan warns that the change in #Erdoğan’s attitude "will always be only tactical, not strategic" &amp; his hatred does not "come from his head but from his heart."

Baku joining the #CSTO  - is it an “implicit condition for the Kremlin to facilitate the “grand peace treaty” that Azerbaijan wants to reach with #Armenia?” Just how involved are #Turkey and #Russia in #Azerbaijan's affairs?

Sir, there's an enthusiasm in #Pakistan's few religious groups who mistakenly feel that #Talibans r reviving real Islam; #Turkey doesn't see that.  #Erdogan is far clever than any religious leader by being a dictator, how to oblige powerful capitals for own benefit &amp; he did that! 
@StassiStassi @johnwarringtons @TULPAR1453 @FabianLeedsNE In Maratha, Santalaris and Aloda, a massacre by EOKA B killed 126 Turks on 14 August 1974, thus legitimatising #Turkey. #UN described the massacre as a crime against humanity, by saying "constituting a further crime against humanity committed by #Greece and Greek Cypriot gunmen”. 
47 years since the #turkishinvasion and #Turkish occupation of #Cyprus 47 years of international silence towards the committed &amp; ongoing crimes of #Turkey  #cyprus1974 #ΔενΞεχνώ

President Tayyip #Erdogan calls on the US to meet “conditions” including financial, logistical and diplomatic support, so that #Turkey can run and guard Kabul airport after other foreign troops withdraw from #Afghanistan.

In previous years, #Atma, a large camp for the #displaced, was referred to by locals as the camp for those “stranded on the #border.” For some, it was a way station before trying to cross illegally into #Turkey
