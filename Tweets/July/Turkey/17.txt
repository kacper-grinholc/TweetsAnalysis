For many, the perception is that Syria's refugees in Turkey are protected as long as Erdogan is in power. Equally,the perception is that there is much to fear for them with regards to their safety and future if the long-time leader of #Turkey suffers in the polls...
Topic of Syrian refugees in #Turkey is an awkward one. I often argue that it is more accurate to say that it is Erdogan who took them in and subsequently protected them with his sheer political weight and power over the state, rather than 'Turkey'.
