@groinath It’s an interesting set of moves for #Turkey, for sure. Will be curious to see how long they stay involved (&amp; how the #Taliban react to that involvement)
see the two (2) mics on the table? @MAturkce of course, and small @dogrusuhaber, that's it, of countless channels, agencies, papers in #turkey, 95% under erdoğan's controle. they all report 7 were killed in a fight btwn neighbors. what a disgrace. what a tragedy. #konyamassacre
