I'm growing weary with #hypocrisy 🙄 US adds their ally #Turkey to the list of countries implicated in the use of #childsoldiers #Biden put your money where your mouth is and do something about it. Perhaps an embargo is in order, if you're serious 
#turkey Turkey is India’s old best friend.  Nowadays that country goes astray by listening to the words of the wrong persons. Turkey please identify who‘s true and genuine.
Why does the #US support #Turkey 🦃 if they are aware of all their #humanrightsviolations and involvement with terrorist groups, not to mention their involvement in Syrian and Lybian wars on the side of ISIS? What does that say about the US? #Hypocrites
#US says pullout target now 'late #August'. #USA's official said drawdown is largely completed &amp; it cld be wrapped up this weekend. Said new #military command structure in #Kabul &amp; talks with #Turkey remained to be chalked out. #Afghanistan #Taliban #Biden

#Syrians trapped in #Idlib formed a human chain yesterday to underscore the importance of cross-border humanitarian aid from #Turkey to #Syria. There are 4.2 million Syrians who are dependent on humanitarian aid across the border #savelifeline 
Happy that #Turkey is isolated even though #Ger is still supporting their #RadicalIslamist regime #Erdogan and his party .
Who does dictator #Borissov meet one week before #elections? Another dictator - Mr. Erdogan. He thanked him for their fruitful cooperation.  PS. What's the real reason for this meeting? Does Borissov plan to escape to #Turkey when the investigations into his alleged crimes begin?
