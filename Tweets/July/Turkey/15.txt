Here’s an important read as we mark the 5th anniversary of the coup attempt in #Turkey. As @simonwaldman1 of @KingsCollegeLon convincingly argues, #Erdogan made a conscious choice to distance himself from the West and pivot towards Russia, China and Iran. 
@abcnews @ahamitbilici_e @bevvo14 Hope @abcnews can find a better informed expert. What happened on 7/15/2016 is throughly outlined in Univ of Utah’s “Turkey’s July 15th Coup: What Happened &amp; Why.” 12 US/EU/Turkish academics contributed. (it was a #Gulen op)👍#turkey #TheWorld @theage
