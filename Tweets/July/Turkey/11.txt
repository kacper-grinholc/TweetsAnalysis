#Euro2020Final Intense disappointment among #England fans is understandable. And penalty shoot-outs are always cruel. But only 1 team can win a tournament. Let us also cast our minds back to the very Ist match of #EURO2020. #Italy v #Turkey. The #Azurri look ominously good then.

Japan is not Azerbaijan. It's the third wealthiest country in the world and don't give a f*ck about your demands. But do you loathe Kurdish that much that you even can't bear seeing it studied thousands of miles away from #Turkey!
