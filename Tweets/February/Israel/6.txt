Children with only my rocks to stand up to the #IsraeliApartheid are faced with guns, and being called terrorists. If they complain to the world they call them anti-semites. Nobody is more anti-semite tan #Israel itself. 
3/5 Anti-Zionist #Jews expect to be fully integrated in whatever subculture. No problem comparing #Israel to Nazi Germany. Genocide, Holocaust? Standard words.   And to show they‚Äôre real #Jews, pics of homemade challah &amp; children‚Äôs bar/bat mitzvah must confess the non-Jews.
2/5 By opposing #Israel‚Äôs existence, anti-Zionist #Jews shows the world that they don‚Äôt like it either.   That there are Jews who call to dismantle the only #Jewish state. That there are Jews who believe #Israel is the worst country ever.
1/5 The explanation of anti-Zionist #Jews behavior looks simple.   #Israel is since 1948 in the spotlights. Jews with self-determination that‚Äôs not what the world really want. And that reflects on Jews worldwide.

‚ÄúWorld will say #apartheid #Israel will say #Antisemitism Evidence will keep piling up. What is written in @amnesty report does not stem from antisemitism, but will help strengthen it. Israel is greatest motivator of antisemitic urges in the world today.‚Äù
