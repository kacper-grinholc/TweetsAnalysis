Yesterday had a mini war taking place in #Hebron between 2 Arab clans.  This is how Arabs sort out their problems with each other, no joke. Well the war resumes today still.  Pray for the peace of #Israel

Children with only my rocks to stand up to the #IsraeliApartheid are faced with guns, and being called terrorists. If they complain to the world they call them anti-semites. Nobody is more anti-semite tan #Israel itself. 
3/5 Anti-Zionist #Jews expect to be fully integrated in whatever subculture. No problem comparing #Israel to Nazi Germany. Genocide, Holocaust? Standard words.   And to show they’re real #Jews, pics of homemade challah &amp; children’s bar/bat mitzvah must confess the non-Jews.
2/5 By opposing #Israel’s existence, anti-Zionist #Jews shows the world that they don’t like it either.   That there are Jews who call to dismantle the only #Jewish state. That there are Jews who believe #Israel is the worst country ever.
1/5 The explanation of anti-Zionist #Jews behavior looks simple.   #Israel is since 1948 in the spotlights. Jews with self-determination that’s not what the world really want. And that reflects on Jews worldwide.

#Israel &amp; its supporters resent accusations by #Amnesty, #HRW &amp; #BTselem of #Apartheid practices against #Palestinians, yet the #Bennett cabinet okays the discriminatory#Citizenship_Law for #Knesset vote as further evidence of #Israel’s true racist nature.
