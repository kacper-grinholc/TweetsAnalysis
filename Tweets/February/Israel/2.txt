@Plippsa I am now terrified, #Jews will be murdered in @amnesty name,  “to end the presence of #Israel”
I cannot commend @Lazar_Berman enough for this remarkable piece of journalism which absolutely lays bear the delegitimization and double standards w/ which @amnesty has treated #Israel. Yes, it amounts to antisemitism. And it is right here for all to see: 
FIRST TIME EVER: For the first time, #Israel allowed a U.S military officer to observe an Israeli Air Force exercise simulating long-range missions, including #Iran Kan news said in a report on Tuesday. 
Amnesty chief proclaimed #Israel apartheid in a presser in Israel, didn’t notice freedom she was granted to do so, said antisemitic report’s numbers were taken from Peace Now. It takes only one interview to unravel the hit job report. 
The USA govt is wrong to constantly shield its Likud cronies from criticism. #Israel is not served by our mild &amp; infrequent rejoinders. We even play the cynical #Likud game and pretend Israel doesn't have nukes. Why do we let the tail wag the dog? @USAmbUN @BBCWorld @nprpolitics 
#Amnesty accuses #Israel of apartheid over treatment of #Palestinians, prompting angry response  
Since the creation of '#Israel' in 1948, governments have maintained a system of laws, policies, and practices designed to oppress and dominate #Palestinians.  #Act4Palestine 
Since the creation of '#Israel' in 1948, governments have maintained a system of laws, policies, and practices designed to oppress and dominate #Palestinians.  #Act4Palestine

@HananyaNaftali Lol facts, joke of the day facts are #Israel is an #Apartheid state #ApartheidIsrael 
Why only #Military govts or quasi-Military govts like now make these overtures towards #Israel ?? @ejazhaider 
‘No country is perfect’: Morrison critical of Amnesty International report on Israel   If our government had integrity, it would condemn that of Israel for its deliberate untoward aggression against Palestinians. Both LNP &amp; ALP fail. #auspol #Israel
#Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani ruled out on Wednesday the possibility of normalizing relations with #Israel.  
How interesting that #Amnesty gets to control who they debate on national media.  And how interesting that Amnesty frames #Israel as: Israel = Jews.  Furthermore, how interesting that Amnesty doesn’t want anyone to upend this framing.  How neutral is Amnesty? 
It's true #Israel Is an #Apartheid state but saying that is not helpful. Wow some people have so much to lose even when #ApartheidIsrael exists. The victims of course.   Germany rejects use of word 'apartheid' in connection with Israel 
@Martina @RepShontelBrown Are you claiming expertise or knowledge because you have neither. Spreading lies about #Israel incites #JewHatred but you know that !

@NikkiHaley sraeli Prof. Ilan Pappe: The Jewish national fund created a file for each Palestinian village (every single 1) to assess expulsion &amp; appropriation plans when time comes. #Israel  Indigenous my ass Just listen ..mind blowing details  The full video here   
Politicians in the west #EU, #UK and #USA start calling out #Israel for its #Apartheid behaviour it’s a #Human duty and take the flak. Israel has to abide by international law and decency. Saudi Arabia doesn’t represent Muslims nor does Israel Jews. 
@GnasherJew One of the many "celebs" who need to show they're still alive and able to spout blatant nonsense about #Israel and #Israel alone. 
@Ostrov_A @amnesty @hrw Still trying to defend #Apartheid by #Israel wow. #ApartheidIsrael
@Ostrov_A @amnesty @i24NEWS_EN Never Mr human rights lawyer from #ApartheidIsrael because there is no evidence of #Palestinian terror or antisemitism but what they did find was Jewish terror #Apartheid by #Israel on #Palestinians with their illegal occupation and illegal settlements under international law

@AJEnglish The world gets appalled when Child Brides, child migrants &amp; Child Sex Tourism hit the news; when children are basically captured &amp; held. #Israel state sanctions the kidnapping/arrest of children. No other country gets a free pass, but they do. #Child #Children #ChildAbuse
Remember that the UN Headquarters was built by Jewish millionaires and collaborators in Zionist❗️  #Palestinian_children to be kidnapped by #Israel🇮🇱📌 The #Official_State does to get “exorbitant ransom = penalty” as exchange for release by the Israeli law.  #BringBackOurChildren

And yet they still wrote ‘Beirut time.’ It’s as if @amnesty can’t even bring themselves to recognize even the mere existence of #Israel!  
Government red tape, high import taxes and plain old greed are just some of the factors that have led to a wave of price hikes in Israel over recent months, according to Israeli economists.  #Israel | #Price  
“#Zionist Jewish organisations [&amp; supporters like .⁦@UKLabour - my words⁩] inflict suffering on Palestinians by excusing and propping up Israel’s #Apartheid system - &amp; wrongly, like #Israel, they do so in the name of all Jews” [which is #AntiSemitic]
