‚ÄòNo country is perfect‚Äô: Morrison critical of Amnesty International report on Israel   If our government had integrity, it would condemn that of Israel for its deliberate untoward aggression against Palestinians. Both LNP &amp; ALP fail. #auspol #Israel
#Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani ruled out on Wednesday the possibility of normalizing relations with #Israel.  
How interesting that #Amnesty gets to control who they debate on national media.  And how interesting that Amnesty frames #Israel as: Israel = Jews.  Furthermore, how interesting that Amnesty doesn‚Äôt want anyone to upend this framing.  How neutral is Amnesty? 
It's true #Israel Is an #Apartheid state but saying that is not helpful. Wow some people have so much to lose even when #ApartheidIsrael exists. The victims of course.   Germany rejects use of word 'apartheid' in connection with Israel
