The #US gov has referenced #Amnesty reports &amp; praised it for its work on the #Rohingya, #Yazidis &amp; the #Uyghurs.  Does the #US gov reject #Israel's accusations of #Antisemitism agaisnt Amnesty, or, do they admit to have been relying on reports from an #Antisemitic organisation..?
In many ways, this is the #Israel that I know, the argument, the yelling, the doubt, the blame, the love, the laughter, the acknowledgement that difference isn't the only arbiter of relationships - it is far from perfect, but also far from a slogan: 
@engagedmom @ntepperman @YairWallach we have gotten their answer. #Israel has so many dead #InnocentCitizens, how many more answers do we need from the Palestinian leadership??
No partner because because there is no #Israel It's only only #Palestine Clear enough??? #BDS

Amnesty's 'apartheid Israel' calumny  #AmnestyInternational #Israel #News #Politics
So is @mikepompeo saying that they (the US) engineered Apartheid in #Israel? They certainly encouraged, financed and protected Israel against any criticism! 
Thank you @realbassemeid for setting the record straight. Organizations like @amnesty @amnestyusa cannot live with #Israel's very existence, and that more  Arab nations are embracing and normalizing relations with Israel. Amnesty International has an agenda. Not neutral. 
#Turkey and #Israel can work together to carry Israeli #naturalgas to #Europe and the two countries will discuss energy cooperation during talks next month, Turkish President @RTErdogan was quoted as saying on Friday.

Like the @benandjerrys interview - where they shrugged their shoulders &amp; nervously giggled when asked about the #hypocrisy of their #boycott of #Israel when NO other country is boycotted - this is a train wreck. It’s hard to defend the indefensible. 
#Israel uses cutting-edge tech to detect &amp; destroy enemy targets across the Middle East.
#WhoopiGoldberg and #ADL both might have been well-served to have read @meriponline Nimrod Ben Ziev's contribution, Tracing the Historical Relevance of #Race in #Palestine and #Israel: 
@HananyaNaftali #Biafra and #Israel join together forever and ever friends 
It is unclear if the attack would help Iran build leverage prior to talks or undermine its position, but increasing attacks on Abu Dhabi whether from Iraq or from #Yemen certainly warn Saudi against developing ties with #Israel.
The decision of @Mu_AlSadr to attack the "Axis of the Resistance" is an unprecedented move and a game-changer because his objectives are meeting the one of #Israel, the #US and all the enemies of #Iran.  However, it could very well be an unjustified angry reaction.  Stay tuned.

Is this the trendy new way to accomplish the goal of eliminating #Israel?   #CharismaNews #Charismamedia  #StandingWithIsrael #ICEJUSA
