Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict     The idea is for there to be a restaurant that donates some of its proceeds to peace between Israel &amp; Palestine. The restaurant would be in Israel &amp; Palestine. The name of the restaurant could be, “The Olive Branch”. #Israel #Palestine

@Amb_Ulyanov This is very crazy. #Israel is not part on NPT and its nuclear capabilities is not controlled or monitored by any international instance. Yet they allow themselves to talk about "#IAEA-related issues" with an important participant of #JCPOA. This does not make any sense at all.

This is seriously the best move #Turkey can make to show it is serious about better ties with #Israel.  It is not a complete disavowal of #Hamas, but this has been an Israeli demand for years.  #Erdoğan however frequently refused.
