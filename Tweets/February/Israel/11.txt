7. #AmnestyReport has forced world governments to rethink their "relationships" &amp; "business" dealings with #apartheid "#israel". Bcs they've not only funded, aided &amp; abetted the #zionist regime's #CrimeOfApartheid, ie #CrimesAgainstHumanity...but
6. The reality of "#israel's" #apartheid #occupation of #Palestine 🇵🇸 should have never been. Numerous people blame #WWII &amp; #Hitler's #Nazism. It probably helped nail it, but fact is the #Jewish #zionists' plot to invade &amp; colonize #Palestine was in making since at least 1882.
4. Ntm, western govs are only now forced a serious rethink of their decades of brazen #weaponizing, funding, aiding &amp; abetting of the #apartheid regime bcs of #AmnestyReport's irrefutable condemnation. Their rejection of the facts as enablers of "#israel's" crimes is irrelevant.
2. Decade after decade, #HumanRightsDefenders &amp; #FreedomFighters across the world emphatically affirmed the fact "#israel" perpetrates the #CrimeOfApartheid, a #CrimesAgainstHumanity, as enshrined in @IntlCrimCourt's #RomeStatute, against #Palestinians 🇵🇸 since 1948.
