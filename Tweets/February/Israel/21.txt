Israel’s Lapid Calls on US Not to Delist Iran’s IRGC as Terrorists Lifting the designation is a precondition to revive the Iran nuclear deal by Dave DeCamp @DecampDave #Iran #Israel #Lapid #sanctions #IRGC   
A senior Turkish delegation, headed by Spokesperson and Senior Adviser to the Turkish President İbrahim Kalın and Deputy FM Sadat Onal, visited #Israel last week to prepare for Herzog's visit to #Turkey and discuss bilateral and regional issues:  
This is what will happen to lead Russia and others to come against Israel... God will put "hooks in their jaws" and draw them down to Israel! All eyes on #Israel and #Damascus! Read -&gt; Ezekiel 38 and Isaiah 17:1! 
Welcome to #Israel! It’s so great to have this impressive delegation of US lawmakers here. @AIPAC 
Wow! #Israel sent a 'Space Hummus' experiment to the International Space Station (ISS) on Saturday, which entails growing chickpeas to explore controlled agriculture for sustainable food sources for future astronauts. Zero gravity hummus? Sign us up! 🚀🇮🇱 
Al-Wefaq was responding to the not-so-clandestine claims by an official at #Bahrain’s foreign ministry, who thought it was a good idea to tell the whole world that the biggest entity in #Israel’s intelligence community "is in Bahrain &amp; they’re present in the region."
The Al-Wefaq movement described the purported presence of #Israel’s Mossad in #Bahrain as "a blatant occupation &amp; an assault on the country &amp; its people." 
The worst is yet to come. I find it best to grow, empower and become independent amongst chaos is the remedy. I love #Israel so much because the level of espionage and cells deep inside enemy lines made them the superpower they are today. Loved by some, feared by many. But FREE!
