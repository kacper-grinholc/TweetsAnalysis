@USUN @StateDept Sanctions against #Russia are correct for what happened in #Ukraine.  #Israel has been committing the same massacres to #Palestine for years. When will you decide to impose sanctions on Israel?

7 years ago Putin assassinated his ✡ political opponent, Boris Nemtsov, and today he is leading an illegal and immoral war against the ✡ leader of 🇺🇦. Yet the ✡ state of 🇮🇱 has been disappointingly equivocal during this crisis. #VolodymyrZelensky #Israel #Russia @yairlapid
Without the referee 4-1 for us. Good work team #Israel #fcbj 
The @England @premierleague @FIFAcom @SkySports etc have now all set a precedent now after the horrible events unfolding in #Ukraine, they have no leg to stand on to stop people showing support for #Palestine, refusing to play #Israel etc, we all know how the #Hypocrites wont
on zionist tv this guy said he wants to go with russia and he feels russia has the power to save them #Israel #palestine #RussianArmy #russianinvasionofukraine #war #sides #UkraineRussiaWar

Even dead #Jews are not allowed in #Palestinian territory. When #Israel left #Gaza, they had no choice but to take the dead as well, disinterred.
If this was #Russia the media would be all over it and #USA would out #sanctions on it, but it is ok for #Israel to abuse elderly in #Palestine. 
Every dictatorship should be buying #Bitcoin right now. Don't get financially stranded like Russia. #Australia #Canada #Yemen #UK #Israel #China #NewZealand #NorthKorea 
@AFP So when @POTUS and @NATO escalate the war in #Ukraine and #Russia responds by nuking all of Europe and the United States and the U.S. nukes Russia, does that leave #China and #Israel as the new superpowers?
Lessons Learnt by #UkraineWar 🧵  1) The media is that powerful, people who are pro- #Israel can become anti- #Russia and not see the contradiction.  2) Same thing is not the same thing - if the West wants to take over your country #Iraq - it's ok - but if it ain't the west, nope

As someone born in #Lebanon, a country that was occupied &amp; abused by #Syria, #Israel &amp; #Iran (Through its Rev. Guards &amp; #Hezbollah) I feel strong kinship with the #Ukrainian people .I am disgusted with those Arab govts that supported #Russia directly or through phony neutrality.
❤️ #Israel auto-renews all visas for #Ukrainians in the country now so they can wait and go back safely. 
#Ukraine shows US decision back in January to renege on its hitherto support for the EastMed gas pipeline (a €6b project to ship natural gas from #Israel through a 1,250-KM pipeline running via Cyprus &amp; Greece to Europe) was, at best, myopic. 
This is #Israel in its finest moment  Making sure our Ukrainian brothers and sisters can come home.  This is what it’s all about @haaretzcom #Ukraine 
@SkyNews When will #FA ask #England to stop playing against #Israel and #SaudiArabia?
#Israel did not sign onto a #UnitedStates-backed resolution condemning #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine that failed to gain #UnitedNations  #SecurityCouncil approval on Friday night. #UkraineUnderAttack #Ukrainian #UkraineConflict @Jerusalem_Post
Russia is doing what Israel did in #Palestine since 1948  #Israel #UkraineUnderAttack #Russian #RussianArmy #Russia 
Wow! That's a lot of water in Ayun Stream 😯 #Travel #Israel #NaturePhotography 
Ukrainians immigrating to Israel, Please make sure you do not get houses on occupied lands. You know what invasion does, do not become part of another one. #israel #ukrain #UkraineRussiaWar #UkraineUnderAttack #Russia
Damn. Whose side are you on #Israel! Enough is enough. 
In the last few decades, #Israel has been consistently forging itself as an island of peace in a turbulent region and has now emerged as one of the important power brokers in the #MiddleEast, opines Mohammed Sinan Siyech. 
#UkraineRussiaWar  Fuck #usa Fuck #Israel  Fuck #NATO Fuck all the west 
We couldn’t of said it any better ourselves #WellSaid #Deserved #UkraineRussiaWar #UkraineUnderAttack #Israel 
@PrincessZeeGirl And why didn't you send paramedics to the innocents who you bombed their homes in Palestine with internationally illegal weapons ? #Israel is a #Terrorist nation

#StopWarInUkraine  #StopWarInSyria  Do you understand fuckers from #Israel and #Russia?
An Israeli medical team is now on its way to the Ukrainian border, with a larger medical team set to join them in the coming days.  #UkraineRussiaWar #Israel #humanitarianaid 
@FIFAcom @FIFAWorldCup when it comes to #Israel sports and politics have to be kept separate but no such rule for #Russia. 
#IUICRaleigh will be going #LIVE Today @ 2pm 💥. #Tune into "WGAI 560 AM Radio Show 📻" in Elizabeth City, NC to watch the #Prophets bring the #truth of the Bible to the 12 tribes of #Israel 🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥   .……………………………………. 
@sherrick399 @HerbKeinon #Russia (Superpower) against #Ukrain interesting! #Russia antisemitic? If it quacks like a duck!! Never again #Israel...
#Turkey's recent openings with Gulf Arab states and #Israel will guide the trajectory of Ankara-Tehran relations. 
The pronouncement comes amid increased tensions between #Israel and #Russia over the latter’s actions in #Ukraine 👇
@PeeSC_CUNY @MikeNew19512115 @CUNY @Hunter_College @PSC_CUNY Your low self esteem and jealousy is showing Zionism isn't racism. Anti-Zionism is Zionism is nothing more and nothing less than the Jewish people's sense of origin and destination in the land linked eternally with its name [#Israel]." Abba Eban 
@BernieRandall8 @Conservatives, @UKLabour and @Keir_Starmer have sold UK to #Israel and have sold out #Palestine.  Didn't hear their cries of anguish when more people died in Israel's onslaught on undefended #Gaza in 2014 than #Ukrainians have died so far @BBCNews @SkyNews @itvnews @GMB
Now tell me who's not taken over the governments of the world...🇺🇸  🇨🇦 🇬🇧 🇩🇪 🇫🇷 🇦🇺  #Israel is a murderous, racist, supremacist, #SettlerColonialist  #Apartheid entity, this is known  to all the PEOPLE in the 🌍🌏🌎 but not their corrupt politicians. #BDS
The Mossad could step in right now and drone Putin and the world would blame Israel. #Israel #UkraineRussiaWar
The situation in #Ukriane is horrible. But just a question why is everyone freaking out over this but the same thing has been hapening in #Palestine #Israel is literally trying to wipe all of #Palestine out of existence! And its been happening for so long! I don’t get humanity…
Thank you #Israel!!  #ukraina #together #stopPutin #WeStandWithUkraine @TuomasEnbuske  @alexstubb @4_Ukraine_  @nexta_tv 
Realizing it will always be desired by #Russia, #Ukraine should take a page from #Israel &amp; train all its citizens, men &amp; women, to fight. Don’t deploy outside Ukraine if not desired, but ready them for homeland protection &amp; self protection. @ZelenskyyUa @POTUS @AdamKinzinger
While the people of #Kiev #Charkow and other cities in the #Ukraine don’t have the luxury of calling it a day, I will. With one last thought: #Israel’s position in this situation is complex. It needs to be in “good terms” with #Putin because of its freedom of action in Syria 1/
