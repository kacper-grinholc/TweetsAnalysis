8. The result of this silence and of #Morocco's national interests not being met is a rising choir of anti-#ISrael voices who had been waiting to see whether the normalization with #Israel will bear fruit for the #Moroccan people.
7. One wonders, therefore, whether FM #Bourita's silence on the US-issued map is due an implicit push by #Qatar to undermine #Morocco's relations with #Israel, and whether the Foreign Minister of #Morocco is once again conflicted on his interests &amp; loyalties.
Covid is not the only disease that needs to be fought. An old but persistent hatred has risen again.   It has always attacked Jews with lies and slander. Now it attacks Jews who defend their homeland of #Israel.   #FreePalestine = Genocide of Jews.  Anti-Zionism is Antisemitism! 
#Israel: Tonight's attack on #Syria was unusual: The missiles targeting Damascus were launched from the Golan Heights (as opposed to air raids from Lebanese airspace). 
#Israel is bombing #Syria now  #EndIsraeliApartheid
5. The #Bourita-#Kushner tacit agreement, it seems, involved the use of Jewish lobbyists &amp; activists to support and advance the #Morocco-#ISrael relations which included active &amp; involved support of the US part of the deal (full recognition of #Morocco's Sahara sovereignty).
You (#Syria’s #Assad) and all your troops (the #Syrian #Arab armed forces) and the many nations (#Russia, #Belarus, #Iran, #China, #Hezbollah, etc) with you (#Assad) will go up, advancing like a storm; you (#Assad) will be like a cloud covering the land (#Israel).” - Ezekiel 38:9 
2. Accordingly, the voices which this publication represents point to the failures of #Morocco-#Israel restoration of relations to advance the goals vital to #Morocco's national sovereignty interests.
