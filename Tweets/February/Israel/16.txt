8. The result of this silence and of #Morocco's national interests not being met is a rising choir of anti-#ISrael voices who had been waiting to see whether the normalization with #Israel will bear fruit for the #Moroccan people.

#Amnesty's #Israel apartheid claim is a continuation of the #Nazis' #antisemitic propaganda.  The same methodology was followed by #Iran, at Durban and now by @amnesty.  What greater abuse of #Jewish #human #rights could there be than this? 
@fairviewsue @RitchieTorres First of all your premise that #Israel is an apartheid state is all wrong. You get your information from clueless and bigoted people who spread lies and misinformation. Most enlightened European countries and the United States have disavowed the false, malicious @amnesty report.
