@sahouraxo Who cares about #Syria and who #Israel bombs. If Israel can’t live peacefully with others, well.... But it behaves right now as a de-facto #American police force in #MiddleEast but that hurts Israel more than it helps. We are going back into the past of empires but with bombs
That is the straight logic of #ApartheidIsrael! Standards only have to apply to others but not to #Israel! 
#Russia : we won't allow Ukraine to join an organization that considers Russia it's mortal enemy.( NATO )  #USA : #Ukraine is a sovereign state  #Israel : we won't allow #Iran in #Syria  USA : Israel has the right of self defense and we will defend it to the last American soldier
@NSRoundtable Precisely. And wanna bet the JStreet types who blamed Bibi for Obama ignoring #Israel's concerns - although they never did explain how that explained Obama also ignoring the US' Arab allies - in the original JCPOA will come up with some new excuse wrt the coming JCPOA-ultralight?
