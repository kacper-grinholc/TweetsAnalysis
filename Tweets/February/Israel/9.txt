@howardbskrville @LmNima @IranIntl_En @JasonMBrodsky @SenRickScott I see both #Iran &amp; #Israel as committing crimes against humanity.  On the theory that @LmNima suggested, paying for the Iron Dome just gives Israel more money to spend on oppressing Palestine, since it frees their own funds they otherwise  would have to use for Iron Dome.
@LmNima @howardbskrville @IranIntl_En @JasonMBrodsky @SenRickScott You aren't reading me.I do think we should care about human rights in #Iran. And as w #Israel, #Egypt, Saudi etc, in *all* these cases including Iran, repeat including, find a good balance between the need to pursue security goals etc &amp; pressure for human rights. Hard trade-offs.

@howardbskrville @LmNima @IranIntl_En @JasonMBrodsky @SenRickScott 2/2 So maybe if we insist, b/c of our perceived strategic interest,on giving #Israel billions that on your theory make it easier for them to pay for  crimes against humanity,we can make the trade off to free up some Iranian assets (their property)  for nuclear non-proliferation.
