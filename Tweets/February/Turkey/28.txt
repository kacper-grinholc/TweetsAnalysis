"How a 1936 treaty could force #Turkey to take sides in the #Ukraine war" 
#Ukraine's call for closure of the Turkish Straits to #Russian warships has renewed interest in the 1936 #Montreux Convention.  @marknevitt provides expert explainer on the #MontreuxConvention &amp; importance in #RussiaUkraine conflict.  #NATO #Turkey 
#Russia is #Hungary for #Turkey and #Greece.
#Ukraine 's Zelensky has made the comedians very popular. Many in #Turkey will be willing to vote for the comedians who are critical of the current government like @CMYLMZ  &amp; @sgokbakar . Do you also want to see a comedian as the leader of your country? Comedians are SMART! 
To the #West:  In 1974, #Turkey invaded the #sovereign state of #Cyprus. 7000 #dead, 200.000 #refugees, 1619 unaccounted still today. Also, 42,000 #Turkish troops still #occupy 37% the island and 150,000 #settlers moved from Turkey.  But no #measures against Turkey!  W H Y  ?
Art 19 of Montreux Conv states: ‚ÄòVessels of war belonging to belligerent Powers shall not‚Ä¶pass through the Straits‚Äô. It‚Äôs accordingly hard to see how #Turkey can block Bulgaria. Romania &amp; other #NATO countries. No doubt Turks will be asked to legally justify  #Ukraine #Russia

Love our secret codes. #FakeNews #MediaMafia report #Turkey Pres. @RTErdogan chess move as ANTI-#Russia. In reality, it's become ANTI-#NATO Op. üòÇ No @NATO vessels in #BlackSea. 16 #Russian naval fleets, incl. missile + landing ships &amp; submarines ALREADY there. Locked and loaded. 
#Turkey has warned countries, whether they share a coast to the Black Sea or not, not to allow warships into the Turkish straits. The Montreux Convention is in full effect.
The biggest military reason #Ukraine is sure to loose against #Russia if #NATO troops, airforce, and material do not enter the fray, is the terrain of #Ukraine is flat (like #Iraq, #Israel) compared with #Afghanistan, #Iran or #Turkey. üìåThus, guerrilla warfare is ineffective.

Turkey's pledge to block some Russian warships from passing through its waters could help repair its ties with NATO. But a buildup of Russian ships waiting to make the journey will test Ankara's resolve over the next few days and show how far it is willing to go. #russia #turkey

Live Updates: #Turkey warns countries not to pass warships through #Turkish straits 
‚Äú#Turkey has announced that it will not let warships through the straits into the Black Sea. This right is granted to her by the Montreux Convention of 1936 in case of war‚Äù  #StandingWithUkraine 
#Turkey has actually closed the Straits to #Russia's warships. Another state expected to duck for cover during this crisis has come out against Moscow.

#Turkey has warned both #BlackSea and non-Black Sea countries not to pass #warships through its Bosphorus and Dardanelles Straits.   (Reuters)
Agreed.   Be ready IF (!!) the West finally wakes up and targets #Putin where he is weakest: #Syria.  It would be wise for the West to get real and target Putin's allies to spoil his soup.   #NATO #Turkey #Assad #HTS 
BREAKING | #Turkey: It was decided to prevent any foreign warships from passing through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles Straits, after #Ukraine and #NATO demanded that it close it to #Russian ships. #Libya 
@SPCAINT ??? Good question !! #dogs #Turkey 
Turkish-Cypriot journalist Ali Kismir, head of the press workers union, is facing 10 years in jail on charges of insulting security forces on the occupied northern third of the island by writing about their interference with the lives of the populace #journalists #Cyprus #Turkey 
üáπüá∑#Turkey will implement some provisions of the #Montreux Convention, probably limiting the ability of #Russian ships to cross the Straits. In case of a conflict in which #Ankara is not a party,üáπüá∑ may shut down the straits for countries that are involved in war.
@theragex If the EU accepts the Ukrainian membership to the EU, then existing #NATO member #Turkey should be permitted too.

#Turkey "invaded" #Cyprus, Why? Because #Greece staged a coup on the sovereign island, and took down the legitimate president of Cyprus. To ultimately annex the island.  They will never tell you this part. They will just say that "Turkey invaded Cyprus". Don't fall for it.

I think the failure of the #Russian military coordination btwn the teams&amp;groups is that there is strong electronic warfare that makes the missions of warplane r difficult.  There is other hidden war between #Turkey #America #France&amp; #Japan against #Russia.   Electronic Warfare
