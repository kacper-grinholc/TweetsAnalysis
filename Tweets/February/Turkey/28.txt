#Turkey Closes The Dardanelles &amp; Bosphorus To Warships, cutting access to Black Sea  Turkey's FM Cavusoglu said all countries have been warned not to transit warships through the straits.  This has big implications for Turkish / Russian relations in #Syria

"How a 1936 treaty could force #Turkey to take sides in the #Ukraine war" 
#Ukraine's call for closure of the Turkish Straits to #Russian warships has renewed interest in the 1936 #Montreux Convention.  @marknevitt provides expert explainer on the #MontreuxConvention &amp; importance in #RussiaUkraine conflict.  #NATO #Turkey 
#Russia is #Hungary for #Turkey and #Greece.
#Ukraine 's Zelensky has made the comedians very popular. Many in #Turkey will be willing to vote for the comedians who are critical of the current government like @CMYLMZ  &amp; @sgokbakar . Do you also want to see a comedian as the leader of your country? Comedians are SMART! 
To the #West:  In 1974, #Turkey invaded the #sovereign state of #Cyprus. 7000 #dead, 200.000 #refugees, 1619 unaccounted still today. Also, 42,000 #Turkish troops still #occupy 37% the island and 150,000 #settlers moved from Turkey.  But no #measures against Turkey!  W H Y  ?
Art 19 of Montreux Conv states: ‘Vessels of war belonging to belligerent Powers shall not…pass through the Straits’. It’s accordingly hard to see how #Turkey can block Bulgaria. Romania &amp; other #NATO countries. No doubt Turks will be asked to legally justify  #Ukraine #Russia

Following a request by #Ukraine, #Turkey has invoked a section of the #MontreuxConvention that will allow it to restrict Russian warships from accessing the #BlackSea. Learn more:    #Russia #Putin #Zelensky #Kyiv #Erdogan #RussiaUkraine #UkraineRussiaWar
Love our secret codes. #FakeNews #MediaMafia report #Turkey Pres. @RTErdogan chess move as ANTI-#Russia. In reality, it's become ANTI-#NATO Op. 😂 No @NATO vessels in #BlackSea. 16 #Russian naval fleets, incl. missile + landing ships &amp; submarines ALREADY there. Locked and loaded. 
#Turkey has warned countries, whether they share a coast to the Black Sea or not, not to allow warships into the Turkish straits. The Montreux Convention is in full effect.
The biggest military reason #Ukraine is sure to loose against #Russia if #NATO troops, airforce, and material do not enter the fray, is the terrain of #Ukraine is flat (like #Iraq, #Israel) compared with #Afghanistan, #Iran or #Turkey. 📌Thus, guerrilla warfare is ineffective. 
The crisis in #Ukraine only validates the importance of #Turkey as a guarantor presence in @TRNCyprus The GC’s have been determined since 1960 to annihilate Turkish Cypriots from #Cyprus. If there was no @TurkSilahliKuvv There would be no Turkish Cypriots. Vatan Sağolsun

Turkey's pledge to block some Russian warships from passing through its waters could help repair its ties with NATO. But a buildup of Russian ships waiting to make the journey will test Ankara's resolve over the next few days and show how far it is willing to go. #russia #turkey 
#Turkey banning ALL warships from passing through #Bosporus Strait is a fair one, does not affect Russia at this time. #Erdogan also stated that Turkey will not compromise with alliances, or turn its back on #Russia or #Ukraine.  #UkraineRussiaWar #UkraineWar
