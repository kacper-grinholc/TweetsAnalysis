To conclude, #Turkey is a useful ally to #Ukraine - be it on trade, defense or in other niche ways, but it is at its limits here.  They are hugely worried about war, but fixated on getting a role they will struggle to do much with towards stopping it.
#Ukraine too, they say, appreciates #Turkey's offers (as #Zelensky has said) but they don't see what it can accomplish.
Analysts I speak to suggest neither #Putin or #Russia has much faith in #Turkey to be able to deliver much the way Washington or Brussels can.  They aren't keen to give it more say in the ex-USSR either let alone give #Erdoğan a photo op to tout at home.
#Russia has made clear they want #Turkey to push #Ukraine to implement the terms of the #Minsk agreement.  Short of that (which Kyiv will hardly appreciate), #Putin said he'd only talk about bilateral issues with #Zelensky. Not #Donbass.
That visit can still happen but keep in mind, the #Russia-#Turkey High Level Cooperation Council is also happening and #Putin has showed barely any interest in #Erdoğan's proposal.
#Erdoğan said that the West has "not contributed" anything to resolve the crisis between #Russia and #Ukraine. He added that @POTUS has not shown a positive approach either.  Keep in mind, RTE is still angling to mediate this crisis and #Putin never committed to visit #Turkey.
