Turkey walks tightrope between #Russia and Ukraine as a #NATO ally:  'Ultimately, #Turkey has deep relations with Russia, but does not have enough credentials to play a mediating role,' @aykan_erdemir tells @JacobEilon.

#Turkey has become an agent of destabilization in Africa; Murdering civilians in #Ethiopia &amp; #Libya, and providing drones to #Somalia despite its critical situation. His eyes are now looking to profit from the #RussiaUkraine Conflict. #Ukraine #Russia #Tigray  #SiyadArts
