#Turkey, overseeing passage to Black Sea, calls #Russian invasion 'war' | Reuters 
#turkey is in a unique position at the southern end of the #NATO territory - and its role as guardian of the straits is a key component of the war in #ukraine. Here's our take on the country's actions:
#Turkey called #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine a "war" on Sunday in a rhetorical shift that could pave the way for the #NATO member nation to enact an international pact limiting Russian naval passage to the Black Sea.

Alleged #Ukrainian drone attack on a #Russian column Certainly, Ukraine had some of these - purchased from #Turkey. So, given the context, likely has some truth to it, even though the poster can be a bit sketchy. IMO likely true, or at least fair and representative✔️
