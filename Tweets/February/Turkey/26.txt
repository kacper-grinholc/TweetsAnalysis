Erdogan holds the key to the Black Sea. Will he block Russian warships entering? A big ask. Putin’s not going to come out of the Ukraine crisis well. It’s a simple choice, but has he the guts? Will he back the right horse? His future may depend on his decision. #Erdogan #Turkey

"The ban on the passage of 🇷🇺 warships to the Black Sea and significant military..." ? Has #Turkey's #Ankara taken a decision in this direction? 
✅It is unhelpful to over-/underestimate the importance of #Turkey's decision to shut the #Bosporus straits for #Russian warships. If there were to be a regional conflagration, then the importance of this decision would increase. On balance, it is a step in the right direction.🇹🇷 
What does #Russia, #UK, #Turkey, #Iran and #Morocco have in common?  You guessed it right, it's a strong tea culture.  Maybe one way to hurt #Russia is to convince #India, #Kenya and #SriLanka to ban tea exports to Russia!

#Breaking #Azerbaijan and #Turkey offer to hold talk with #Russia. Sadly, megalomaniac #Putin does not want a negotiated settlement. #Ukraine 
I love Ukraine because they sold Azerbaijan white phosphorus to do war crimes. I hate them though because they are nazi larpers. #Nazi #Azov #Azerbaijan #armenia #RussiaUkraineWar #russia #Ukraine #turkey

@barbaros08 @ASabadus I support the kurds, and say #Turkey have double standards and are cowards, my opinion, they can prove me wrong
#Turkey making efforts for immediate ceasefire, Erdogan tells #Ukraine's Zelenskiy #SmartNews #IStandWithUkraine

#Kyiv asked #Turkey to close #Bosphorus and #Dardanelles Straits to #Russian military traffic. But fearing Russian economic &amp; even military retaliation, Ankara will resist, unless provoked by Russia. Follow #ukraineconflict here:   (photo by adam hles) 
Countries that have closed their airspace to Russian planes. #Finland and #Turkey, what’s up? #StandWithUkriane 
@PierrePoilievre Dear @PierrePoilievre, I hope you can take a minute to read, pause, reflect.  Sadly I did NOT see any support from you when Armenians were under attack by @NATO member #Turkey &amp; #Azerbaijan as well as hired Syrian mercenaries. 
@nexta_tv #Turkey #Finland #Norway #Germany #Denmark it’s time to close your airspace too.
Greece has nothing to offer not even souvlaki to the refugees of Ukraine.  So in order to join the conversation, it's more worried about Turkey than the unfolding events.  Does Greece see anything other than souvlaki and Turks?  #Ukraine #Erdogan #Greece #Turkey
