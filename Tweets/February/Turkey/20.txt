If sanctions don't work, what does in their view? Accepting #Russia's demands of #NATO will not be happening, but #Turkey has signaled it supports "meaningful deterrence" over sanctions.   The problem is that what this means is unclear, but the consequences likely the same.
There really is no good option from the Turkish standpoint.   Out of #Turkey breaches #NATO solidarity by declining to join tougher actions against #Russia or it invites economic or other retaliation from Moscow.
If the attack happens, it will leave #Turkey at a loss on how to respond to pressure from either the West or #Russia.   Ankara never joined sanctions in the past, but it has not done much either to limit Russian violations of the Montreux Convention as it has in the past.
#Erdogan's foreign policy aide Ibrahim Kalin spoke to Die Welt and shared comments on #Turkey's view of the #Russia-#Ukraine crisis:  -Kalin said that #Putin wants to redraw #Europe's borders, but his interests should be accounted for;  - Repeats view that sanctions don't work;
The United States, NATO and Russia ignore #Turkey request to mediate in the current #Ukraine conflict
