This is seriously the best move #Turkey can make to show it is serious about better ties with #Israel.  It is not a complete disavowal of #Hamas, but this has been an Israeli demand for years.  #Erdoğan however frequently refused.
In other news, #Turkey will receive a visit from #Israel's @Isaac_Herzog on March 9-10, according to Turkish media.  More significantly, media in both country report #Turkey may deport members of #Hamas' military wing as a goodwill gesture.
