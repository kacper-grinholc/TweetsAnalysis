#Turkey arrests 10 #Iran intelligence agents assigned to kill #Israel business tycoon Yair Geller while he was in Turkey. Turkish national intelligence organization #MIT and Israeli #Mossad worked together to foil the Iranian government plan.  
With accession talks at an impasse, #Turkey and the #EU need another way to revitalize their relationship.  @IlkeToygur with @Carnegie_Europe's #EuropeanDemocracyHub 👇 
Important to remember this story comes as #Israel's President @Isaac_Herzog is expected to pay a visit to #Turkey and meet with #Erdoğan.  RTE is still recovering from COVID-19, so likely a final date hinges on his recovery.
#Turkey busted an #Iran-led cell aiming to assassinate an Israeli businessman inside the country.  The cell included a mix of Turkish and Iranian nationals, but the businessman Yair Geller was alerted to the plot by Turkish intelligence.  #Israel's Mossad aided in the cell bust.
