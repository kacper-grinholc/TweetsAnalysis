#Turkey is an awesome country!
It has also been #Turkey which has been demonstrably opposed by its so-called NATO allies on almost all fronts, also against #Russia. 'They' preferred to finance a designated terror group (read: PKK/YPG) in Syria (and now they're shitting their pants). #Ukraine

Russia’s invasion of #Ukraine stirring up a lot of emotions for survivors of #Turkey’s brutal 1974 invasion of #Cyprus. Almost 48 years later our homes are still occupied by a foreign power and we and our loved ones are still suffering the consequences. Take care of each other.
