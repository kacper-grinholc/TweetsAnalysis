#Egypt quiet as #Turkey reaches out to eastern #Libya @MFetouri 
Simple, the #US considers, wrongly to my point of view, #Turkey a more valuable partner than #Greece + #Cyprus.  One of the reasons for the #EastMed Pipeline by the US play, Mr. @Zemenides, is appeasing Turkey. It has nothing to do with its cost effectiveness. Because it is! 6/6
#Turkey's for one constant violation of #Greece's sovereignty, Mr. @Zemenides, is the least condemnable. But how come the #US "allows" a co-NATO member act against the irrefutable legal rights of another? 5/6
In a previous thread of yours, Mr. @Zemenides, you stated, that #Turkey is the #US worst ally ever, but what has the #US done since 1974 to terminate Turkey's illegal occupation of #Cyprus? I see no real pressure applied on Turkey re this topic. 4/6
Unless you consider what so far appears a sudden "change of heart" of #Israel towards #Turkey, Mr. @Zemenides, also a coincidence.   👉 As I have expressed to you in the recent past, I am not anti-American Mr. Zemenides. On the contrary! But foremost, I am pro-Greek! 3/6
A question, if you could be kind enough to answer Mr. @Zemenides:  Do you also agree with the #US' position - despite the ridiculous assertion that Mr. @amoshochstein only expressed his personal views - that the #EastMed should be routed via #Turkey? 2/6
It is the pipeline, stupid. It confirms that for the #US the interests of #Turkey are more important than those of #Greece.  Mr. @Zemenides you've said nothing new in this article of yours but to support the US governments' play. 1/6  | Via @ekathimerini 
@MAturkce I mean, AKP government, REALLY has developed and maintained these close links, support, and control over these Jihadist gangs including al Qaeda, Nusra &amp; ISIS. #Turkey's interior minister visits to build morale after ISIS defeats in #Syria these last weeks. I mean, @NATO? Really? 
Lots of interesting info here. Also noteworthy that he gave his interview to *Turkish* state media.   Recall that #Turkey was *the* main player in #Libya. #Erdogan undoubtedly sees #Mali as part of the neo-ottoman strategy.

#Turkey President #Erdogan says tests positive for #Covid19.
#Greece and Southern #Cyprus want to usurp the rights not only of #Turkey but also of other Eastern Mediterranean stakeholders.  It is hypocritical to claim the borders of the same map by saying "The map of #Seville does not belong to us".

Also, after the #Turkey-#Libya agreement, the hasty #Greek-#Egyptian agreement has no legal basis!  The island of #Rhodes is a natural extension of the Turkish mainland. It cannot create a maritime jurisdiction other than its own territorial waters. 
northeast-#syria is under pressure from #daesh, #turkey and #assad, all groups/countries/persons with a tremendous amount of blood on their hands who want to crush (kurdish) autonomy. #rudaw is owned by #kdp of the kurdistan region in #iraq, which is friends with turkey. #context
these attacks are obviously wrong. me being forever in team #pressfreedom doesn't necessarily mean i'm in team #rudaw though, since i'm also in team #journalism and rudaw is connected to increasingly dictatorial #power and to fascist #turkey.
In addition, it is seen that geodetic maps were used in the agreement between #Greece and #Italy. This is the same methodology that Turkey uses in the Eastern Mediterranean; It confirms #Turkey's maritime neighbors with #Libya, #Israel and #Palestine.

The one &amp; only thing I like about #COVID19 is that it has exposed to the international community that #Syria’s #Assad &amp; #Turkey’s #Erdogan are human like everybody else. For #Assad has been tested positive for it in the past &amp; #Erdogan has now just been tested positive for it.
