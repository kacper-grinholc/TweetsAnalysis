It's now quite obvious, given the principled position of the #UnitedStates, #GreatBritain, #Turkey, #Poland, #Latvia, #Lithuania, and #China that in the event of a #russianinvasion under any pretext, despite its nuclear potential, Russia risks the most serious defeat in 100 years
In an emergency, #Ukraine can only rely on the #USA and #Turkey. &gt; In case of a Russian attack, #Ukraine can never count on the #EU. This is also confirmed by internal documents. &lt;

56/57 The deaths of thousands of immigrants in the sea are entirely at the hands of #Turkey and their partners, who throw people in the middle of the sea to achieve their political and profit goals. 
55/57 All of the above information is based on more than 2 years research by many #OSINT accounts. It is a fact that #Turkey conducts human trafficking and they use their gang of NGOs, journalists, and MEPs to defame Greece with fabricated stories. Everything is coordinated.
54/57 #Turkey is doing the same tactic in #Cyprus, by sending immigrants to the occupied part and then forcing them to pass the green line and go to the Greek side.
52/57 It is not just Somalis though. They bring immigrants from Syria, usually from the Turkish-backed FSA and lately they started bringing immigrants from Palestine, most likely members of #Hamas, which #Turkey has strong ties with. 
50/57 However, none of these immigrants are picked randomly. Most of them are picked from Somalia because #Somalia has strong military ties with #Turkey.

48/57 In this video, you can see how #Turkey conducts human trafficking and what they do to the immigrants who refuse to comply. 
43/57 Also many times #Turkey has accused #Greece of stealing the clothes of the immigrants and publish photos of naked immigrants as proof, however the reality is different. This video is from the Turkish side of the border.  
26/57 Elliot Higgins is the owner of Bellingcat and has denied receiving funds from #Turkey to do propaganda against #Greece. However, his tweets and his obsession with the Greek coast guard and the fact that he never accuses #Turkey of trafficking are a little suspicious.
