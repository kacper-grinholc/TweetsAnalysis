#Putin the Poisoner's imminent invasion of the #Ukraine has two purposes. The second unspoken might be most important: to raise the price of oil to the level of $200/barrel and up. The US economy tanks, Biden and the Democrats lose and, bonus, helps the rise of fascism in the EU.

WTF does #Russia expect? #Putin engineered this crisis. #NATO should give Putin🖕🏻and move thousands of troops into #Ukraine. Putin is a terrorist, and terrorism needs to be hit head on. Putin ramped 💩 up in the first place. We aren’t blind…we can see through the BS! 
A lot of this is correct, but it's not helpful when @AEI forgets that #Ukraine is not an ally of the US. 
@ambassadorlion @MoldovaMFA @MFAofArmenia @nicupopescu @sandumaiamd I love #Armenia. Great country, awesome people. To be honest, it's too bad you Ambassador Lion left #Ukraine assignment as #Israel needs more proactive stand against very active glorification of #Nazi collaborators. Sadly @michael_brodsk seems to be not as proactive as you were

@McFaul If Rep. Khanna wanted to rein in nuclear weapons, he would support #Ukraine &amp; the #BudapestMemorandum, in which 🇺🇦gave up nukes for a sovereignty guarantee. Instead, he tweets Ukraine slander &amp; refuses to apologize. #StandWithUkraine  .@RepRoKhanna
