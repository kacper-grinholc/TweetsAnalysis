Britain‚Äôs failure to tackle Russian dirty money has enabled Putin‚Äôs aggression -I agree with @NicolaSturgeon - If Boris Johnson is serious about helping Ukraine, the most resolute action he can take is at home in Londongrad  #Ukraine

It means absolutely nothing.  Like this step was necessary for Russia to do what it always does. The intellectuals spoke. Who cares? Those 2000 "intellectuals" Should have spoken sooner.  Much Much Much Sooner. Thanks for the dumb gesture. Waste of ink, electricity.  #Ukraine 
So if Vlad the Inhaler invades #Ukraine, it's reassuring to know he will get a strongly worded letter from the UK and USA! #NATO
It's a good thing I wasn't at the #Ukraine presser. I'd have told @BBCJLandale where to go.  I really have had enough of this f**king nonsense from #msm @Conservatives

@BorisJohnson flees to #Ukraine. 
#BorisJohnson doesn't need to go to #Ukraine to prove what a swinging dick he has every married woman in Westminster already knows
With tensions mounting in #Ukraine, U.S. officials have grown concerned over the threat of #cyberwarfare. The U.S. has now dispatched Deputy National Security Adviser Anne Neuberger, to Europe to discuss the Russian threat: 
When Putin annexed Crimea in 2014, he said "I have said many times already, we are one people. Kiev is the mother of Russian cities." #RussiaUkraine #RussiaInvadedUkraine #Ukraine 
#BorisJohnson has cancelled his trip to #Ukraine I guess there wasn't any decent parties for him to attend
"The UK and other countries will be judged, by the people of the Ukraine and the world, on how we respond and how we help" - Boris Johnson speaking in Kyiv.  @BorisJohnson #ukraine #ukrainerussia #borisjohnson #europeanunion
@Amb_Ulyanov Dear Mikhail  What's your idea regarding @BorisJohnson's warning to Rusia in the press conference? #Ukraine 
@neilwallis1 @BBCNews Because they've seen the enprous backlash against @BBCJLandale absurd, embarrassing &amp; hugely disrespectful first question asked of @BorisJohnson on the crisis in the #Ukraine
@Dominic2306 IF YOU HAVE PHOTOS PRODUCE THEM NOW !  PUT UP OR SHUT UP!  WE HAVE A WAR TO FIGHT IN #UKRAINE !  EITHER LET HIM GET ON WITH HIS JOB OR STICK THE KNIFE IN NOW! üò°#patygate #Borisjohnson
Apologies for our outrageously rude, disrespectful &amp; embarrassing media - &amp; also those tweeting about our PM on your thread. I can assure you they're but a tiny - yet very vocal - minority, &amp; they're all best ignored. üá∫üá¶üá¨üáß #BorisJohnson #UnitedKingdom #Ukraine #PressConference

@PentagonPresSec John Kirby on #Putin and #Ukraine: ‚ÄúHe has enough capabilities to move now if he wants to, and he continues to add to those capabilities.‚Äù  He later added, ‚Äúwe would not characterize what we see as de-escalatory.‚Äù @DeptofDefense 
@DSA_Intl_Comm US and Russia are major trading partners. The narrative is more complex than America bad and Russia good. Russia is Saber rattling too. Geopolitics sucks #dsa #Russia #Ukraine #Socialists #psl
@GBNEWS @nigelfarage .. Isn't history wonderful ü§îüôÑ ..   #Ukraine  #RussiaUkraine 
@StevenM61475297 @Iloveautumn2 #Putin in #Ukraine is getting another dividend for his investment into #Brexit.
Has anyone ever thought about this - Maybe #Putin is trying to save the #UnitedStates by taking over and exposing the corruption in #Ukraine that owns and controls the #BidenCrimeFamily #Biden
If Russia further invades Ukraine, thousands of Ukrainian Jews will be evacuated to Israel  #Ukraine #Jewish #Russia #religion #Israel   
Under @RussiaUN presidency in February, the Security Council will discuss, among other situations, #Somalia, #Yemen, #Haiti, #MiddleEast, #Iraq, #Syria, &amp; #Ukraine. Members will also hold debates on sanctions issues &amp; threats to int'l peace and security caused by terrorist acts.

@BBCNews are in the Last Chance Saloon after the latest moronic question from their so-called political correspondents. They need to get their house in order quickly, otherwise the Govt should do it for them .... permanently. #jameslansdale  #Ukraine  #DefundTheBBC
Russia is playing with hell if invades Ukraine in this buildUp support from multiple allies, #Ukraine
#partygate #Ukraine #ukrainerussia Supporters of #BorisJohnson blame #bbcnews for asking the question.  My point is that a statesman on the world stage should be somebody of  unimpeachable character.  
@JeremyWard33 Yeah. Ba-doy. USA 101 ‚Äî if you end a war in Afghanistan you have to make up an imaginary war to soak up those funds. #Ukraine #UkraineConflict
@bbclaurak It will be British and American diplomacy that hopefully avoids military action. Who else do you think is going to resolve the #Ukraine crisis?   #NATO #bbcnews #Putin #Russia #USA #BBCBreakfast
The problem with writing a paper on non-recognized separatist "states" is that their sketchy websites just don't load or are generally unstable. Do better #Donetsk and #Luhansk. Maybe put some of that @mfa_russia money into IT support. #Ukraine
#Russia, totally surrounded, puh.  #Putin #Ukraine
