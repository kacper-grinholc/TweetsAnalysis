#ForTheRecord - #Putin will not invade #Ukraine. I'll go one step further, his days as 'president' of #Russia are quietly numbered.
If there is to be a war, it won't be a sudden bolt-from-the-blue blitzkrieg. Putin will need a pretext, likely civilian deaths in eastern #Ukraine. Once we see that casus belli, war would probably begin within days. That's the Georgia scenario from 2008.

Reminder: #Russia does *not* need to wait for the ground to freeze to begin its major assault on #Ukraine.  In modern war, the opening shots come from the *air*, not the ground.  There will be big air &amp; missile strikes for *days* before any sizeable üá∑üá∫ ground forces move in.

üá∫üá¶ EVENT: Pls join us on Feb. 8th, 5:00pm #Kyiv time for the next #TTFU briefing on #Ukraine‚Äôs info security &amp; countering Russian propaganda. @JonDKatz @Denys_Dav @Bruno_Lete @gmfus @RPR_ua @StateDept @USEmbassyKyiv @cspan @EuromaidanPress @KyivIndependent 
Russia üá∑üá∫ must be quaking in their boots , UK üá¨üáß  send another 350 troops #Ukraine #NATO #UK
@Liveuamap Less shrooms, please. #Ukraine #Russia
Ironically #Putin respects #COVID boundaries and not actual ones.   #Russia #Ukraine 
Can @KremlinRussia_E afford the geoeconomic cost of losing European energy market, in return for its geopolitical gain in #Ukraine? @POTUS has turned European energy dependence into an economic #deterrence to deny #Russia the geopolitical gains, without directly threatening war! 
Why I started my Netflix subscription couple of years ago‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ a vivid tale of #heroism #winteronfire #Ukraine #fightforfreedom #thebestdocumentary           A testament of #humanspirit  #civilrights #revolution #crying #emotional #inspiring #KeepItOn 
@LeeGrimesEvans @JoeBiden @EmmanuelMacron I'm more glad that @joebiden @POTUS has threatened the pipeline if #Russia invades the #Ukraine.  No more war.
#Oil_and_Gas #Energy #Defense #Vladimir_Putin #Ukraine Biden says Nord Stream 2 won‚Äôt go forward if Russia invades Ukraine, but German Chancellor demurs   
Interesting defence-related interview with @JRaubo on whether #Russia attacking #Ukraine could have a #nuclear  dimension - all that and more on #TVPWorld news 
In which #Putin uses a rape analogy re: #Russia and #Ukraine / #Zelensky at a press conference 
#Ukraine President #Zelensky canceled his meeting today with German FM #Baerbock because she refused to say #Germany would abandon #NordStream2 pipeline even if #Russia invades 
#Macron "but today President Putin calmed me down"  Glad Macron's nerves are settled.   #Ukraine  
RANE Briefing on Nation-State Cyber Attacks. As the #Ukraine standoff continues, learn when and how #Russia, #China, #Iran, and #NorthKorea use #cyberattacks against other nations. Listen here: 
Gold. #Russia #China #Ukraine #NATO
Writing in @thetimes, @BorisJohnson reveals plans have been drawn up to deploy jets to Romania and warships to the Black Sea. Defiant message to Putin comes ahead of a big week of diplomatic efforts to tame Russia with Truss and Wallace heading to Moscow on Thu/Fri #ukraine 
‚ÄúWhen the Soviet Union was falling apart in December 1991, #Ukraine held a referendum on the independence it had long sought. A whopping 92% voted in favor ‚Äî a result that helped accelerate the collapse of the Soviet state just weeks later.‚Äù  #war
And here we are. Same propaganda, marketing and selling method for the next war! The never ending villain Russia! They wanna go into #war with #Russia in #europe in #ukraine  STOP THAT GOVERNMENT! Same lies as the nuclear lies in Irak! 
back from #Ukraine unless they called off prosecutors investigation #HunterBiden corruption in Ukraine as VP under @BarackObama ! Where is the outcry Americans? This so called president Biden is destroying us &amp; his corrupt @DNC does nothing but go after Trump who kept promises!
Important online event coming up... #Ukraine #UkraineCrisis 
#BREAKING #FRANCE #RUSSIA   üî¥FRANCE, RUSSIA: AFTER MEETING WITH #MACRON, #PUTIN SAYS.   "If #Ukraine joins NATO and decides to return Crimea using military means, European countries will be automatically at war with Russia and ‚Äòthere will be no winners‚Äô"  #Flash #Nato #Video 
@BorisJohnson pretends to care about #Ukraine.  Also, unexpected weight loss suggestion. 
@VisaCA oh I thought that was an advert for #Ukraine   (Blue/Yellow)
@AnnalenaLauren "&lt;Expletive&gt; Like or don't like it, be patient my beauty."  Sounds like lizard brain is taking over here.  #Russia #Ukraine
So basically , Putin received Macron to stop the liability of war in #Ukraine and he used that to insinuate that fr also likely under threat. Hmmm
@NatashaBertrand @HC_Richardson A VERY bad idea for Ukraine's stock exchange and economy which plunged after the US diplomats were asked to leave! If @JoeBiden wanted to destroy #Ukraine, he would not act otherwise! ü§¨
Jesse Waters got it right.  BILL CLINTON is to blame for the #Ukraine crisis.  Budapest agreement.  The Clintons have f----d up the world for the past 30 years.  I've been waiting for someone in the media to say this.  @JesseBWatters #UkraineCrisis @BillClinton
‚≠ïÔ∏èüá∑üá∫#Russia: Transportation of tanks and APC‚Äôs through Millerovo/Rostov on February  7,2022, just fee km from üá∫üá¶#Ukraine 
The recent events in Ukraine reveal the risk of reallocating the defense budget to other whims and interests of whichever politician is currently in office #Ukraine #defense #Military #spending #Budget @HumanEvents 
Interesting. If true. #Ukraine 
This nuclear freak has gone mad.   #StopRussia even before he orders to invade #Ukraine the disguised ‚Äúgreen people‚Äù and tanks way.   Financial sanctions on Putin and his mafia group will do the job. Stoping #NS2 before he takes it as a victory in this KGB black mailing campaign. 
Hopefully they will both stick to this.    #Ukraine #Deutschland #NordStream2 
‚ÄúThere are currently around 250,000 people in #Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces, although President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ‚Ä¶ signed a decree to increase the size of Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces by 100,000 troops over three years and raise soldiers‚Äô salaries.‚Äù  #war
#TheFive...#Biden issues a warning to #Russia.."Don't invade #Ukraine during my afternoon NAP"...Don't do it.
"Considering the atmosphere of tension in and around #Ukraine, many older residents have had memories of previous wars resurface. [..] Now, as they approach the end of their lives, they are again witnessing an uncertain and unstable world." 
@jlynn122 @GovKathyHochul They can stop sending tax money to #ukraine and use that for the balances of poor American citizensüßê 
#ukraine Simple solution. West agree that NATO will not include Ukraine. Russia agree never to invade Ukraine. Job done.
Russian President Vladimir #Putin said he hoped the situation around #Ukraine could eventually be resolved peacefully and that he saw no alternative to the existing #Minsk peace accords to resolve the conflict in eastern #Ukraine. 
In presser w/ #Macron, #Putin again dismisses #NATO open-door policy as a "wide interpretation" of the alliances rules, insisting NATO "has no obligation" to accept a new member.  It's important to note that no one has ever said NATO had to take in #Ukraine. #Russia
#VladimirPutin mockingly chooses to put #EmmanuelMacron at the other end of a very long table, for supposedly important #Ukraine talks. 
#Russia may well fear that #Ukraine, backed by @NATO, will try to seize back #Crimea, which #Moscow could see as attack on #Russia. Just b/c we don't see it like this doesn't mean it's not at back of #Russian minds &amp; reason for troops near border.
