commitments of membership and contribute to the security of the alliance. Shares NATO's values ‚Äã‚Äãof democracy, reform and rule of law. Exactly NATO expansion on #Russia's borders #Ukraine's efforts to join NATO 6- NATO is a coalition of #European and North #American countries.
#WTI #Crudeoil tops $90/barrel- 1st time since 2014 as demand surges while supply remains constrained. If #Russia invades #Ukraine (end-Feb after Beijing Olympics?) in this inflation year (like 2008, when oil set record near $150) it could soar to new all-time highs? @OntAg 
I can't go anywhere or talk to anyone without everybody impatiently crying out for War in #Ukraine.   The groundswell is deafening. The bagger at my grocery store told me he felt downright giddy.
#RUSSIA planning FAKE ATTACK inside #Ukraine.  #Ukraine needs to TELEVISE these reports so Russian people know who to blame when they have to stand on ration lines again!  @RT_com @ZelenskyyUa
#Russia seeks 19 and 16-year sentences against #CrimeanTatars for talking about their faith #FreeYalkabov #FreeSeidametov  #LetMyPeopleGo #Ukraine    
@DailyMirror Its a disaster that when #Ukraine needed the UKs support they had to deal with a pillock called #Boris! We should be doing far more to deter #Putin instead of just talking sanctions that seldom ever work.
Whoever the reporter MATT is just completely DESTROYED the #BidenAdministration entire #Ukraine War narrative 
They want that war...do they?  WARNINGs are OUT!üá∑üá∫ üá∫üá¶ üá∫üá≤ üá®üá¶ Avoid all travel within 50 km of the border with #Ukraine due to the risk of armed #conflict.

Unrelatedly, or is it?  This dystopian portrait of an American teacher, in the midst of a toxic fertilizer plant fire, closing the class door due to toxic fumes or opening it up due to Covid‚Ä¶  This is American.  #Russia #Ukraine #Covid #collapse  
This is why people distrust the USG.    #Ukraine #RussiaUkraine 
Strange how "false-flag attack" scenarios get instant #media traction if "reputable intelligence sources" attest that they are being fomented by the enemy.  #Russia #Ukraine #NATO #uspoli #Geopolitics #WarDrums  
The crux of #Ukraine #UkraineConflict: "Putin doesn‚Äôt have to worry about elections or pushback from the opposition. Mr. Putin has no concerns about bad press or poor poll ratings. The Kremlin has silenced the local, independent press." @KremlinRussia_E 
Russia Reportedly Planned To Use Fake Video With ‚ÄòGraphic Scenes‚Äô As Pretext To Invade Ukraine #russia #ukraine #usa
‚ÄúBut once again I repeat: no written document in which the Government of #Germany showed that even those helmets they will be transferred to us, we have not yet received.‚Äù ‚Äî @oleksiireznikov, Minister of Defence of #Ukraine, February 3, 2022 via @DefenceU:  
The Pentagon on Thursday said the Kremlin may plan an extensive false flag operation including ‚Äúgraphic propaganda video‚Äù to frame Ukrainian forces as a ‚Äúpretext‚Äù for an incursion. #Ukraine #Russia  Read more at #JustTheNews: 
@APHClarkson @KofmanMichael @MassDara @shashj @Po12345679 @law Gents that will not work. #Ukraine will apply the #Swiss tactics developed by Maj. von Dach. One who is in the war business must know this book and doctrine. This means hell for #russia 
German Chancellor #OlafScholz said he would soon travel to #Moscow to meet #VladimirPutin to discuss #Russia's military build-up near #Ukraine. Learn more:    #Germany #Berlin #Scholz #Putin #Kyiv
Excellent analysis of #Ukraine from Rep. Omar‚Äî she opposes turning that county into the third largest recipient of US military aid with ‚Äúa very soft trigger‚Äù that could lead to war.  Remarkably few members of Congress have questioned our rush to escalate this crisis. 
Maybe question official claims about #Russian war in #Ukraine. Two yrs ago @washingtonpost published a trove of documents revealing our officials failed for nearly 2 decades (over multiple administrations) to tell the truth about the war in #Afghanistan 
#US claims #Russia planning '#false #flag' operation against #Ukraine using #video 
Sounds a lot like, the old WMD trick play is being called. #Ukraine #RussiaUkraine #propaganda #NarrativeWars 
@USAlight3 POTUS can not ignore #Ukraine issues or our Allie‚Äôs just as he is not ignoring #Voting #BLM #BBB #Isis ‚Ä¶. He‚Äôs doing his job.  It‚Äôs difficult, sometimes moves at a seemingly glacial pace and rarely goes as planned.  I‚Äôm glad we have a real #President at the helm.

Arseny @Yatsenyuk_AP to @BBCBreaking on #RussianAggression &amp; #Ukraine üá∫üá¶  A very sober and straightforward opinion somewhat different from the Ze-position.
That's right the abuse #Ukraine has suffered at the hands of @KremlinRussia_E has been happening. Vlad has successfully taken #Ukraine apart. No country should forget #Crimea belongs to #Ukraine
