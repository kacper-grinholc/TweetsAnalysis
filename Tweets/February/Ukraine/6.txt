Biden rattles his sabre at Putin … but it’s Xi he really wants to scare #Ukraine 
@Lucian_Kim #Putin supported war crimes committed by #Serbian separatists who engaged in #EthnicCleansing to annex territory. He will now happily drive out #Ukrainians to annex most of #Ukraine for #Russian speaking residents. Wherever #Russians live is considered Russian territory.
Attack on #Ukraine could occur at any time. The former deputy defense minister of Ukraine tells the BBC that February 20 brings end of Olympics and announced end of Russian maneuvers in Byelarus-Perhaps a convenient day for attack.
@Lucian_Kim #Putin never had the slightest intention to invade #Ukraine. The #Russian troops are there on a contingency basis dependent upon an attack by #Kyiv on the autonomy-seeking #Ukrainian republics.  This retired general is off his rocker.

@SigneWilk Did you think about your statement even in the slightest?  It's #Donetsk &amp; #Luhansk regions of #Ukraine who are surrounded &amp; who suffered &amp; died when #Kyiv sent its troops &amp; militias to attack them.  Yes, Ukrainians died. Not killed by #Russians. By #Ukrainians from west Ukraine.
@oscaru2 @McFaul He can do all he wants with Ivashov, but matters little since this statement is out. Getting rid of Ivashov would only increase the weight and gravity of Ivashov’s words.The problem for Putin is that Ivashov’s statement &amp; premise is pretty much bang on in its assessment. #ukraine

#Canada, #Ukraine and #Fascism, Canadian officials who met with Ukrainian unit linked to #NeoNazis feared exposure by news media: documents  via @ottawacitizen
So, @benandjerrys is solidly in the "fuck #Ukraine" camp 
The ignorance of many people pretending to be military and/or foreign policy experts on Twitter is hilarious. The least little "report" or video sends many into grossly illogical or unfounded "analysis," and outright hysterical commentary. #Russia #Ukraine #UkraineCrisis
#USAF RQ-4 Global Hawk #AE5420 returning from surveillance of the Donetsk region, actively avoiding airspace controlled by Russian forces / DPR rebels  #Ukraine

If #Russian crushes #Ukraine, what then?  If we impose sanctions they will never remove all of their troops and they probably will have installed a pro-Russian autocracy by then.  Is NATO prepared to do more?  Indifference will make Ukraine another Czechoslovakia.  #Putin sucks.
Genocidal Racist US wants war in EU to make money.  $4b US make from Ukraine by bleating about a non-existent war from conditions that existed since 2014.  #EU #Ukraine #Russia pointing all their long range missiles at US and sinking a few aircraft carriers may prevent this war.  
Does #Putin - an incorrigible #Sociopath - WANT a war of aggression (now on #Ukraine)? Certainly! Is #Russia's #Sociopathocracy or its #military, going to stop him? No! They never did. The #Criminal seeks openings, with demands to foil #diplomacy. Will the West stop him? It will! 
Historian @anneapplebaum at @AnneWillTalk on the German government's stance on arms deliveries to #Ukraine:   "Germany always uses history as an excuse when it's appropriate." 
@DaveMM16 @Amb_Ulyanov They are in there own territory not in #Ukraine. Euroopan are not  frightened American soldiers are running around European cities from one country to other but they are frightened by #Russian soldiers who are in their own territory??? #Iraq #Afghanistan #Syria #Libya #yugoslavia
Western leaders are hoping to get through to President #Putin, the man who singlehandedly shapes Russia’s course amid its military buildup near #Ukraine and whose designs are a mystery even for his own narrow inner circle.
🇺🇸🇵🇱US paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived to Rzeszow, Poland aboard a C-17A Globemaster III. #Ukraine #Russia 
There's been a phone call between @POTUS and @EmmanuelMacron about #Russia-#Ukraine. 
"Other than #Russia, no country looks worse during the current #Ukraine crisis than #Germany."  
Yet another #DoomsBiden #Policy. When will #UnitedStates stand up against #Russia? spineless @POTUS. security adviser Sullivan says Russian invasion could come 'any day now' on  #Ukraine  
🇺🇸 US equipment arrived to the Polish port of Gdynia on February 4. #Ukraine #Russia 
#Olympic level geopolitics. #China got 2008 hosting, then 2022 b/c #Euro bids dropped after doping scandal in 2014 Sochi #Russia. Now Russia &amp; China team while Olympics tank &amp; Putin licks chops over #Ukraine &amp; maybe east/west war. #Olympic lesson, eh? No homor among thieves.
That is why #Washington believes that the conflict in #Ukraine may reunite #NATO again under the slogan of confronting Russian expansion, which will mean greater #US oil and gas exports to the old continent and remind them of the importance of #America as a leader. 12/16
#Ukraine #UkraineConflict  Comme d'habitude ce ne sont pas les russes qui cherchent la guerre mais les USA Souvenez-vous... As usual it's not the Russian who want war but the USA Remember...

🇺🇸Russia could invade Ukraine “as soon as tomorrow,” Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan claims. #Ukraine #Russia 
Let’s remember that Trump lapdog &amp; #GOP standard bearer @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews gave #Putin the @GOP’s blessing to invade #Ukraine. #putinspuppets #putinsGOP
#Texas should mobilize to assist #Ukraine  @BetoORourke
#China knows what it's doing by backing #Putin on #Ukraine. We're the ones embarrassing ourselves with weak policies and let our enemies take advantage of us with no deadlines or red lines.
