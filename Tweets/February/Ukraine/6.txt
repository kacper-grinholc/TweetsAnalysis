Attack on #Ukraine could occur at any time. The former deputy defense minister of Ukraine tells the BBC that February 20 brings end of Olympics and announced end of Russian maneuvers in Byelarus-Perhaps a convenient day for attack.
@Lucian_Kim #Putin never had the slightest intention to invade #Ukraine. The #Russian troops are there on a contingency basis dependent upon an attack by #Kyiv on the autonomy-seeking #Ukrainian republics.  This retired general is off his rocker.

List of #Macron calls over the few days regarding #Ukraine #Russia üëá 
I agree with #Ukraine. I think #Putin is trying to rattle #Biden into putting troops in Ukraine, then he could have an excuse to hold up, however flimsy, to go into Ukraine. Don't bite, Mr. President. 
~ #The #Ukraine #Cookie ... Dear Boys In Rage &amp; Obsession, What Would You Do, If I Say Naively: "Neutralize The Ukraine Politically &amp; Let It Disarm Itself. Let The Ukraine Not Become Russian, Not European, But Let The Whole Ukraine Be A Non-Militant Buffer Between All Conflicts ~
@paulg #Ukraine was at one time part of "Commonwealth of Independent States" after 1991. Wouldn't that provide a legal excuse for #Biden to agree it can't join #Nato , and keep the peace???
Do you think Putin will hold off on invading #Ukraine until after the #Olympics2022 are over so he does not offend Xi by stealing their spotlight?
@nypost Right ..and now he wants to protect #ukraine border.. Meanwhile he lost American soldiers  lives in Afghanistan as well as an Afghan family and left billions upon billions upon billions of military equipment  in Afghanistan ...this guy is a complete fool #stolenelection
@triantafyllidi2 Actually, its 300 more gifts like the ones he gave to ISIS that Putin is waiting to seize when they invade.  Those will be in Russia's hands, courtesy of the traitor in chief in the next parade for the world to see.  Minus the ones Putin will gift China. #Ukraine
#Macron is trying to find solution to the problem #Ukraine #Russia the best way possible for #Europe.He is using all diplomatic sources involving himself fully. At the same time,other forces,well known to us at #Balkan,are trying to make his effort irrelevant.üá™üá∫
#Canada, #Ukraine and #Fascism, Canadian officials who met with Ukrainian unit linked to #NeoNazis feared exposure by news media: documents  via @ottawacitizen
So, @benandjerrys is solidly in the "fuck #Ukraine" camp 
The ignorance of many people pretending to be military and/or foreign policy experts on Twitter is hilarious. The least little "report" or video sends many into grossly illogical or unfounded "analysis," and outright hysterical commentary. #Russia #Ukraine #UkraineCrisis
#USAF RQ-4 Global Hawk #AE5420 returning from surveillance of the Donetsk region, actively avoiding airspace controlled by Russian forces / DPR rebels  #Ukraine 
Poland will hand over light 60-mm mortars and 40-mm hand grenade launchers to Ukraine   #Ukraine #Poland #StrongerTogether
@AntifaBoyfriend @Redtagu @Angry_Staffer Just ignore all them troops just camping and roasting marshmallows. Hahahahahaha #RussiaUkraineCrisis #Putin #Ukraine

If #Russian crushes #Ukraine, what then?  If we impose sanctions they will never remove all of their troops and they probably will have installed a pro-Russian autocracy by then.  Is NATO prepared to do more?  Indifference will make Ukraine another Czechoslovakia.  #Putin sucks.
Genocidal Racist US wants war in EU to make money.  $4b US make from Ukraine by bleating about a non-existent war from conditions that existed since 2014.  #EU #Ukraine #Russia pointing all their long range missiles at US and sinking a few aircraft carriers may prevent this war.  
Does #Putin - an incorrigible #Sociopath - WANT a war of aggression (now on #Ukraine)? Certainly! Is #Russia's #Sociopathocracy or its #military, going to stop him? No! They never did. The #Criminal seeks openings, with demands to foil #diplomacy. Will the West stop him? It will! 
Historian @anneapplebaum at @AnneWillTalk on the German government's stance on arms deliveries to #Ukraine:   "Germany always uses history as an excuse when it's appropriate." 
@DaveMM16 @Amb_Ulyanov They are in there own territory not in #Ukraine. Euroopan are not  frightened American soldiers are running around European cities from one country to other but they are frightened by #Russian soldiers who are in their own territory??? #Iraq #Afghanistan #Syria #Libya #yugoslavia
Western leaders are hoping to get through to President #Putin, the man who singlehandedly shapes Russia‚Äôs course amid its military buildup near #Ukraine and whose designs are a mystery even for his own narrow inner circle.
üá∫üá∏üáµüá±US paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division arrived to Rzeszow, Poland aboard a C-17A Globemaster III. #Ukraine #Russia 
There's been a phone call between @POTUS and @EmmanuelMacron about #Russia-#Ukraine. 
"Other than #Russia, no country looks worse during the current #Ukraine crisis than #Germany."  
Yet another #DoomsBiden #Policy. When will #UnitedStates stand up against #Russia? spineless @POTUS. security adviser Sullivan says Russian invasion could come 'any day now' on  #Ukraine  
üá∫üá∏ US equipment arrived to the Polish port of Gdynia on February 4. #Ukraine #Russia 
#Olympic level geopolitics. #China got 2008 hosting, then 2022 b/c #Euro bids dropped after doping scandal in 2014 Sochi #Russia. Now Russia &amp; China team while Olympics tank &amp; Putin licks chops over #Ukraine &amp; maybe east/west war. #Olympic lesson, eh? No homor among thieves.
That is why #Washington believes that the conflict in #Ukraine may reunite #NATO again under the slogan of confronting Russian expansion, which will mean greater #US oil and gas exports to the old continent and remind them of the importance of #America as a leader. 12/16
#Ukraine #UkraineConflict  Comme d'habitude ce ne sont pas les russes qui cherchent la guerre mais les USA Souvenez-vous... As usual it's not the Russian who want war but the USA Remember...

üá∫üá∏Russia could invade Ukraine ‚Äúas soon as tomorrow,‚Äù Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan claims. #Ukraine #Russia 
Let‚Äôs remember that Trump lapdog &amp; #GOP standard bearer @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews gave #Putin the @GOP‚Äôs blessing to invade #Ukraine. #putinspuppets #putinsGOP
#Texas should mobilize to assist #Ukraine  @BetoORourke
#China knows what it's doing by backing #Putin on #Ukraine. We're the ones embarrassing ourselves with weak policies and let our enemies take advantage of us with no deadlines or red lines.
