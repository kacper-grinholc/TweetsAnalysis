Communist #China's #Xi calls for the Biden administration to compensate #Russia in #Ukraine for #Putin's immense loss of the #Whitehouse in the aftermath of the defeat of his subservient American puppet, Donald J. Trump.  #Olympics

@EndGameWW3 I got the distinct impression that #China actually encouraged #Russia in their goal against #Ukraine and #NATO no discouragement at all.
Why Does US see a threat, when Ukraine does not?  Here’s what Dr. Nicolai Petro, Comparative and international politics  Professor, had to say about it.    WATCH MORE:   Only on   #ukraine-russia #nato #internationalpolitics

Opinion💭by @RogerKimball  As Glenn Reynolds has been saying, “Everything is going swimmingly.”  Putin has 100,000 troops massed on the border of #Ukraine. Will he invade? President Biden seems to think a “minor incursion” would be OK. 
The #Biden administration are sending at least 8,000 troops to Eastern Europe to flee the region as soon as #Russia invades #Ukraine 😅🤣😂 #IdiotLeader 
#Biden White House on #Ukraine and #Syria: If you don’t trust us, then f–k you...Well, okay then...No. Trust you? Sorry. We tried that.
Did I mention that the radioactively-polluted #Chernobyl Zone (with its massive #nuclear waste storages) is also a huge depopulated #Ukraine-#Belarus border area - and thus a likely new warzone now, just like in the cult Ukrainian video game

Fairly significant that we're seeing JSTARS flying in the dead of night. In #Ukraine. On the #Belarus border. 
RT - very rare to see @usairforce operating over #Ukraine at this hour👇 
@clivehaswell @STWuk #NATO expansion has nothing to do with #Russia's belligerence against #Ukraine. Ukraine is not a NATO member. Four NATO members already share borders with Russia. Your position is PRO-WAR, not antiwar.
An open letter to the Russian leadership by the #Russian Congress of Intellectuals:  "We openly and publicly call out the Party of War that has been formed within the government."  #Ukraine  
@CatherineDVries @oonuch Indeed. But what does majority in existing #NATO states want? Spoiler: no NATO for Ukraine. So please have referendums in each #NATO state to solve this once and for all: "Do you want #Ukraine to become a member of NATO?"
JSTARS operating over #Ukraine at this time in the morning is slightly concerning, maybe due to the increase in US troops in eastern Europe or maybe due to the sheer mass of #Russian military on the border they are required to operate 24/7 where reports of 150k+ troops are
@integritycdn @HannahThibedeau @fordnation Yes. Maybe call NATO, except they’re busy in #Ukraine.
