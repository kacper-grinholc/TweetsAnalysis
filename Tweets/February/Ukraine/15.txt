One must admire Putin’s strategy— weaponise mistrust in leadership to the point where if he invades #Ukraine it is because Biden is feckless. If he doesn’t, it’s because because Biden is over dramatic and dishonest.   America loses, in either case.

President Biden today warned an invasion of #Ukraine could still happen -- but he had a message for Vladimir Putin: Give peace a chance.  How we reported it for @CBSEveningNews... 
#Ukraine #UKsanctions  So the British gov accepts Russian dirty money flows into the city of London and if Russia invades Ukraine sanctions will be applied. Therefore if there is no invasion  UK again turns a blind eye to proceeds from Russian drugs and crime. Business as usual.
