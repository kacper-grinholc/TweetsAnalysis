@NDI @AmbDMitchell .@AmbDMitchell nails it: "Democracy anywhere is a threat to autocracy everywhere."  "There is no greater threat to Putin than a prosperous, pluralistic and democratic #Ukraine." 🇺🇦🇺🇦
Perhaps the best thing to do would be to accept #Ukraine in the #NATO defense pact tomorrow and then see what the #KGB  lawn gnome says.
If #Russia edges closer to #China as a result of the #Ukraine crisis, it will complicate matters for India, given her requirement of military hardware from the former, says Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty. 
#Putin is thinking about his place in #Russia History hundreds of years from now. We remember #CatherinetheGreat not her casualties. #Ukraine needs to gird itself and so does rest of world.

As expected, Macron went to Moscow and raised the French white flag. Now Ukraine are under pressure to change their constitution to avert a Russian invasion.  #Ukraine #macron 
Perfect piece from @NDI president @AmbDMitchell on #Ukraine:  "Why are Ukrainians willing to sacrifice so much? The answer lies in #democracy itself... the system most likely to deliver unity, stability, development and personal dignity." 
Pigs love mud. #Russia #Ukraine 
@HorribleNews4U @HeatherMoAndCo @DrSeuss1940 Yes. The idea of a #playbook means sharing techniques with bullies near and far.  Hence #FluTruxKlan is #RentAMob circa 2014 #Ukraine redux.
#Nazis fought #Soviets from June 21, 1941 to early May 1945. Ground was not always frozen. #Russia, #Ukraine, #Putin Millions of casualties
"Observing Minsk Accord only way for peace," says French President Emmanuel Macron as he holds separate meetings with Russia's #VladimirPutin and Ukraine's Zelensky  _____ #Ukraine #Russia

@SpyTalker @speechboy71 Oh, that's cool. Another dimension to #Ukraine issue for the democracies. Xi is watching.
@DineshDSouza I voted for #obama in 2008 &amp; 2012, Bush in 2000, and #Trump in 2016 &amp; 2020. And learned of unlawful #spying on Trump, and ABUSE OF POWER by #Democrats w/ Covid-19. It's time for massive #investigation . #Spotify #Ukraine are distractions from Democrats' Communist Revolution!

#OOTT #WTI As diplomatic efforts continue around the clock this week, a #Russian invasion of #Ukraine may likely be avoided. The fallout will remove one of the pillars supporting ultra-high oil prices in no time.

Nothing to see here. #Putin denies plans to invade #Ukraine. There must be a link between psychotic behaviour and the ability to tell the truth. 
Ukraine acquires nuclear weapons. Discuss. #Ukraine

The Kremlin threw cold water on #Macron's claim that #Putin said he wouldn't escalate the #Ukraine crisis. Also taking  crack at macron, saying #Paris is 'not the leader' in #NATO so they 'couldn't do any deals'. #russia #usa  
#OOTT #WTI This week, headwinds against oil bulls have come from two geopolitical areas: #Iran and #Ukraine. The revival of #JCPOA shall dent oil prices at least a few US dollars or much more per barrel.
