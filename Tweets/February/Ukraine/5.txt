@CaspianReport Basic trolling and comedy. Russians are wise too. They love a troll joke.  Huge hint: Putin's popularity results are increasing, whenever he is showing #Russian dominance on the global stage. That's why #Ukraine is invaded.  Ukraine is a puppet in the domestic politics of Russia.

Is this the announcement that #Ukraine will invade Russian-speaking break-away provinces, to provoke war with #Russia?  “It is time we begin offensive actions aimed at securing our national interests. Our citizens are united in wanting their territory returned,” Ukraine President 
@McFaul correctly notes that moratorium on #Ukraine’s #NATO membership isn’t a panacea. True, but no one has said it is. It would have to be combined with other agreements, eg: Ukraine’s right to procure arms &amp;training for self-defense, no foreign troops/ bases in Ukraine, etc.

#Putin is as much strategy as threat. #Russia is 70% there with total war preparations, against #Ukraine. Destabalising the region, #Europe, advances his objective of recreating "Greater Russia"👇 He has manouvered towards this on many levels.
@Serpico741 @FiredStaffer @zolotasynytsya @JenkemSuperfan @AnneNotation @benandjerrys @sentinelle06 Crimea used the #Kosovo precedent created by the West. If ethnic Albanians can declare independence so can ethnic Russians of course.  #Ukraine #Russia
#Germany’s dependence on fossil fuels, which mostly come from #Russia, restrains it from fully joining the US in opposing Russia’s aggression against #Ukraine. Under pressure from #Putin, Germany would need alternative gas suppliers in the dead of winter.
@konrad_muzyka @Krisehandtering @olgatokariuk Let's really hope West tells government/army of #Moldova proper that they should NOT use a Russian invasion of Ukraine to try to get back #Transnistria. Imagine Romania aiding Moldova to do just that... Not very likely to happen. But still. Let's be aware of this.  #UKRAINE

An intriguing alternative narrative of the #Ukraine crisis by @shustry: an old bond between #Putin and a Ukrainian #oligarch, Viktor #Medvedchuk, is at its heart. Putin, ever isolated in his estate, is determined to impose his man on Ukraine, come what may 
But that's precisely the point: it won't deter #Russia should they choose to invade #Ukraine.  And if, as does happen in conflicts, the theatre of that conflict should expand into neighbouring states and members of #NATO, that will trigger Article 5, and we're at war.

@POTUS #Ukraine So questioning admins actions and strategies is now helping #Russians.  This seems quite #authoritarian and less #American.  Our leaders need to be questioned.   And often.
🤣😱 so the party of #defence has undermined the UK’s defence to the point I’d argue that any threat we make about #Ukraine is pointless

#Russia and the US have the twin tasks of preventing an escalation in #Ukraine as well as negotiating a new #European security architecture that would be more stable than the one that has existed since the 1990s, says @niveditakapoor. 
Is this the #FalseFlag #misinformation the @StateDept spokesman @StateDeptSpox was taking about? Just so you know Ned, this was not #Russia. #Ukraine 
Ministry of Defense of #Ukraine announced the arrival of the eighth aircraft from the United States with 86 tons of ammunition.  Since the end of January, the United States has already sent more than 650 tons of military equipment to Ukraine.

@LucasFoxNews We are concerned for the offense to human intelligence, made by #Ukrainian &amp; US propaganda. Simulation of urban war in #Pripyat! 😂 So it's granted! Ukraine it's going to be invaded &amp; solution is guerrilla resistance! Hope #Chernobyl radiation wakes you! #Ukrain #Ukraina #Ukraine

Whoa! Hey! Hold on! #UK and #France agree? 😲  “UK and France agree #Nato must ‘unite against Russian aggression’” #Russia #Ukraine 
“But if #Russia chooses to invade #Ukraine again, the move could ‘embarrass Beijing’ because ‘it suggests that #China is willing to tolerate or tacitly support Russia’s efforts to coerce Ukraine,’ “ ⁦@washingtonpost⁩  
#Russia may be having an identity crisis, but #Ukraine is not. After 8 years of Putin's relentless hybrid warfare against Ukraine—continuing Russia's long dark legacy of imperialism, colonization &amp; genocide—Ukrainians are more sure than ever, they don't &amp; won't belong to Russia. 
@XSovietNews But he has invaded #Ukraine twice &amp; is threatening to do it again, &amp; that will be a tragedy for #Russians &amp; #Ukrainians just like the #Napoleon &amp; #Hitler invasions.
@konrad_muzyka And where are the #Ukraine military?
Photos of The 8th shipment(In last 2 weeks) of "lethal aid" from the United States with 86 tons of ammunition has arrived in Ukraine. That is more than 650 tons of military equipment from the USA to Ukraine in 2 weeks Info from: Ministry of Defense of #Ukraine. #Russian 
Hello Everyone, 1/11) One wonders if this situation will lead to possible conflict. American soldiers training with Ukrainian troops   #Russia  #Ukraine  #UnitedStates #NATO
@LawDavF After 853 yrs of #Russian invasions of #Ukraine it is doubtful warmongering vs Ukraine will stop until it can fully protect itself. Also there are no “separatist enclaves”, which is Moscow propaganda that deflects from the Russian invasion &amp; occupation in 2014. Don’t fall for it.
