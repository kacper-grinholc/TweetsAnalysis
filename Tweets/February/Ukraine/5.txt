An intriguing alternative narrative of the #Ukraine crisis by @shustry: an old bond between #Putin and a Ukrainian #oligarch, Viktor #Medvedchuk, is at its heart. Putin, ever isolated in his estate, is determined to impose his man on Ukraine, come what may

@POTUS #Ukraine So questioning admins actions and strategies is now helping #Russians.  This seems quite #authoritarian and less #American.  Our leaders need to be questioned.   And often.
ü§£üò± so the party of #defence has undermined the UK‚Äôs defence to the point I‚Äôd argue that any threat we make about #Ukraine is pointless

Hello Everyone, 1/11) One wonders if this situation will lead to possible conflict. American soldiers training with Ukrainian troops   #Russia  #Ukraine  #UnitedStates #NATO
@LawDavF After 853 yrs of #Russian invasions of #Ukraine it is doubtful warmongering vs Ukraine will stop until it can fully protect itself. Also there are no ‚Äúseparatist enclaves‚Äù, which is Moscow propaganda that deflects from the Russian invasion &amp; occupation in 2014. Don‚Äôt fall for it.
