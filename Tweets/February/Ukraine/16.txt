@eucopresident I agree, but this is just the first step of a long path. I really hope. #Ukraine #UkraineConflict #Europe
@7NewsAustralia yesterday reported ‚Äì like a station platform announcement about train departures ‚Äì that a Russian invasion of the #Ukraine was due to occur at midday yesterday.   But a more thoughtful piece from #Politico asks now: Why Feb.20 worries Russia watchers.  #auspoll
‚Äú#Ukraine has asked the #UnitedNations Security Council to discuss on Thursday a bid by #Russia's parliament to recognize self-proclaimed separatists in eastern #Ukraine.‚Äù  
Dear @jensstoltenberg , have you asked #Ukraine what for they need dosimeters and radiation protection suits? Are they planning something nasty that would threaten European security? We still remember #Chernobyl. That would be nice if people in the #EU would know what to expect. 
I hear they have T-shirts that say....  WWIII - Defend the Fatherland Day - February 23, 2022.  #Ukraine #Russia 
Well that was quick #Russia #Ukraine 
‚ÄúThe #UnitedStates warned on Wednesday that #Russia could use false claims about the conflict in #Ukraine's #Donbass region, including reports of mass graves &amp; allegations of chemical weapons production, to justify an invasion of #Ukraine.‚Äù 
The prospect of a war in #Ukraine is bad news for the data center industry. Ukrainian companies manufacture over 70% of the world‚Äôs neon gas supply - which is essential in semiconductor production. 
@AmbDanFried @John16280 @SecBlinken @MSNBC If world had stood up to #Putin he wouldn't have invaded #Ukraine be threatening them again weaponized troll farms to interfere in US election Brexit right wing parties in France Germany spread Covid disinfo killed 1,000s or radizalized people to overthrow Gov't in US and Canada
Perhaps @EmmanuelMacron should allow Brittany independence? And the @eu_comission Catalonia? That might persuade #Ukraine to give up the 2 separatist provinces to #Russia? ........ France and Germany are a pair of sh1ts

BLIND MAN‚ÄôS BLUFF: Russian strongman Vlad #Putin achieves his magnum opus amassing Russian forces near #Ukraine to coerce myopic Westerners still traumatized from Vlad‚Äôs 2014 #Crimea invasion without firing a single shot.  #Trump #MAGA #Trump2024 #SaveAmerica #FJB #LetsGoBrandon

On a NEW #AllStarPanel #podcast, @BretBaier is joined by @HaroldFordJr, @TGowdySC, and @ChadPergram to break down #PresidentBiden's diplomatic efforts in #Ukraine.   
It would be safe to assume they will lie and fabricate results to use as a pretext for military action against Ukraine.#Russia #Ukraine 
A Russian invasion of Ukraine could drive up already high oil and natural gas prices, prolonging elevated inflation around the world and dealing a blow to any country dependent on Russia for energy. #oil #russia #ukraine #UkraineCrisis

Definitely a welcome and well thought out perspective of what costs #Putin would incur if he did launch a full scale (further) invasion of #Ukraine
