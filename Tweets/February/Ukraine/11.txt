11/02/2022 #Ukraine Read this thread about potential Russian military threat to Ukraine 
Any Republican who supports Putin's invasion of #Ukraine likely would have supported Hitler's invasions of Poland and other nations.
#Ukraine  stop the war!!  The Russian people must do something to stop it, America is the one who will dance on the wounds of the Ukrainian people, America is not America's ally and the Democrats are only arms dealers. 
A Russian invasion of #Ukraine, should it happen, has the potential to cause extensive and debilitating #SupplyChain disruption across the globe. This may result in rising input costs to a heightened threat of #CyberAttacks.

There is now a general agreement that — to save #Ukraine from #Putin’s #Russia — nothing short of massive U.S. military intervention will suffice.   Get ready folks - the only quick solution is to advise Ukraine to surrender. And who’s going to say that, @PentagonPresSec?  
Todays conflict is rooted in historical grievances between #Russia and #Ukraine. #Putin is ensnared in his own perception of history and some very big hubris problems.

Hold this thought. #Ukraine 
#Russia has the troops in place to invade #Ukraine "at any time" and American citizens should leave within the next 48 hours, the #US has warned.  An invasion could start with aerial bombing that would make departures difficult and endanger civilians, the White House said.
Reserves of ammunition, fuel, and all personnel for the front line units (not just the vehicles). That's what has to be there for action to happen. #Ukraine
I don't think we could possibly have a worse President in this situation than Joe Biden.   #Ukraine #Russia #JoeBiden #Invasion #War 
@_HenryBolton @DPJHodges Priorities here guys. Any Russian action in #Ukraine will be bloody and merciless in a way we haven’t seen since Barbarossa.  Very important that the major security players - and the UK is still one - present a united front. Pettifogging for party advantage undermines that stance

So #Putin seems ready to attack #Ukraine. Once again we're going to be treated to the spectacle of people dying for the gratification of a megalomaniac's ego.
As the world braces for imminent Russian invasion of #Ukraine, recall that the GOP suddenly, inexplicably, changed its platform regarding Ukraine days before the 2016 RNC.  Now we learn #Mueller considered it criminal, but declined to charge.   Would any of this be happening now?

U.S. President #JoeBiden urged Americans to leave #Ukraine immediately, as his top diplomat said that a Russian invasion could come “any time” — including during the Winter Olympics, which end in nine days.

What #Russia  is going to do to #Ukraine  a$$ 
Hmm. So the WWII was a kite-festival, right ? 🪁  No, I'm not a war-monger &amp; i empathise with d people of #ukraine. 🙏 Had grt hopes from you Palki, but u disappoint. I'm afraid, your Intn'l trips have been a let down. And so has been my⏲️invested in Wion.  😞🔌📺  @palkisu 👋 
Let us pray for the peace and victory of Ukraine, may God free the world and Ukraine from war!  That the Russian President gives up this war objective, that Our Lady of Fatima crushes the communism of the nations!  #Ukraine #Peaceful #Russian #PrayForTheWorld #UkraineCrisis 
From the foreign minister of #Ukraine: 
Is it just me or are western countries just chatting immense shit about Russia invading? Keep your pathetic noses out of it UK &amp; USA. You're so tacky. #Russia #Ukraine #UkraineCrisis #UkraineCrisis
@I_Katchanovski Do you think Canadian, American media will pick up that story? I doubt. #Zelensky has been violating #FreedomOfSpeech in #Ukraine and nobody from world leaders publically criticized Ukrainian government for it. Total failure of defending #freedom of #media.
#RussiaUkraine NATO should have moved a division into #Ukraine months ago &amp; created a “no fly zone”over #Ukraine -  EU &amp; NATO diplomacy would have been backed with some steel says @Tobias_Ellwood on @BBCNewsnight; #KurtVolker emphasising support for #Ukraine @CNBC $SPY $VXX @FT 
Lately, it’s been quite hard to keep my head cold while covering news on #Ukraine. My family is there, and they keep a straight face. So do I, while reporting from the White House  daily about all those "imminent, major, looming." But it’s emotionally hard.
Muscles can't endure the minds lashes for so long. #Ukraine  #اوكرانيا
Maybe,  #Biden will send Putin  a Social Worker  and a Safe Smoking Kit. #Ukraine
