OPINION: Ukraine has elected a comedian to be president, but the U.S. has elected a president to play a “comedy” over Ukraine. It seems neither Russia nor Ukraine wants to start a war, nor does Europe. #Ukraine

Ukraine has called on Russia to show more "transparency" regarding possible military plans. Kyiv says Moscow has so far ignored formal requests to explain its build up of troops near its borders, and this would be the "next step." (KI) #Ukraine #Russia #Transparency #Military

There really isn't any good faith negotiating going on. Russia is using Ukraine as leverage to exact concessions from the West: get on your knees or we'll strike. They know we haven't any viable military options. #Ukraine 
Most likely scenario IMO:  1. Russia doesn't invade #Ukraine. Many reasons why it would seem against their interests now (leaving aside evilness of it). posturing to get concessions? 2. Fed does raise, but less than expected  #stocks down. #crypto down. looks like good entry.

@GyllKing You do have to wonder why we have a sudden orchestrated crisis in #Ukraine and @BorisJohnson is busy trying to bury any discussion about #PartyGate and #MetPoliceUk questionaires.  Is #VladimirPutin helping out his mate at #Westminster ?
Am I the only person wondering if #Russia massing troops near #Ukraine is like a stage magician distracting the audience whilst the real action is happening unnoticed elsewhere?
If Putin attacks Ukraine, other countries will follow. There should not be 3,000 US troops, should be 300,000 US troops.Your Wimp in the White House is messing up. But what do you expect for someone who really did collude with the Russians. #DurhamReport #ukraine #TrumpWasRight
