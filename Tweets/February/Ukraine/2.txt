#joshhawley criticizes #JoeBiden for adding troops in eastern #Europe and supporting #Ukraine  Sounds like he's been watching too much #tuckercarlson again
The United States and Russia have spent the past several weeks building up military forces and inching them closer together on the European continent  @TIME @SecBlinken #Ukraine
@caitoz   This is a very non biased analysis of the events taking place in #Ukraine.  Everyone should watch and understand how #USA and #NATO are the aggressors here not Putin's #Russia . People still championing American exceptionalism are bloodthirsty neocons.

Is Putin the new Nikita Jrushchov?  " #USA president #Biden has ordered the deployment of an additional 2,000 troops to bolster #NATO defences in Europe, strengthening the alliance‚Äôs response to a possible #Russian invasion of #Ukraine."  #Ukraina #Russia

Dutch prime minister tells #Ukraine it has 'friends all over the world' 
Destabilizing the Ukraine economy without firing a shot is one of Russia‚Äôs goals, just like they destabilized it in 2014, when Biden-Obama were in the WH. The Ukraine hryvnia lost 70% value in 2014, thanks to Biden-Obama. #BidenWorstPresidentEver #BidenIsALaughingstock #Ukraine

Russian invasion plan for 2022. Putin will concentrate on the region south-east of the Dnjepr.  #UkraineCrisis #Ukraine 
Media parroting anti British rhetoric of Moscow government. Very unpatriotic of our Press at a time of near war. Smacks of appeasement #Ukraine

#JohnPilger is widely respected for the quality of his investigations into the politics of foreign nations. Thus his contentions are of concern. What evidence exists that govt in #Ukraine was overthrown by Obama  or that current govt is infested with #NationalSocialists?

@senrobportman Just a reminder of how much you really care about #Ukraine #UkraineCrisis #UkraineConflict 
lol! @STVNews desperately trying to convince us that #Russia is trying to invade the #Ukraine they‚Äôve got tanks which are only 200 miles from the border! Ha ha!! For some reason the tanks were firing shells as well - bit of dramatisation there I think #STV
@g_gosden @ThisStarChild He is probably carrying the United Kingdom nuclear weapon launch codes or location of MI6 officers in #Ukraine or #Russia üòÇ
#VladimirPutin getting it wrong over @NATO and #Ukraine according to newspaper for US #Military. 
This frees up space in my office, so I'm glad. I then visited the 2 ships at the NCT. They had crew from #Philippines, #India, #Russia, #Ukraine, #Romania, #SouthAfrica, &amp; #Romania. I've also gotten some of the work for the big caps thank you letter done. It's getting there.
Having just watched #Munich tonight, I fear history is repeating itself #Ukraine #boristheclown
.. Will the United States arrange a confrontation for Ukraine's interests with Britain? And the price will be what.. #war #usa #uk #Ukraine
P. sure that "Non-escalatory force posture alignment" is NATO-speak for "Fuck around and find out" #ukraine

@JackPosobiec #Ukraine    Alexander vindmen lis not making predictions. He has inside info, a decision has been made. 200,000 lbs of weapons and ammo are being sent to neo Nazis, same ones used in 2014. They are gonna be unleashed on eastern ukraine. Thank biden fo that one. 
Why don't we invite Russia to join us, and Ukraine, in the NATO? Let's all be friends. There's no need to feel threatened.  #Oekra√Øne #UkraineCrisis #Ukraine
