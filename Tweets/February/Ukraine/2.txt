@SebastianBae @hoplitemarine Version 1.0 of my #Ukraine scenario is finally written, and will be playtested soon! @BarrickTim @yuvalweber 
Biden Orders Deployment Of Thousands Of Troops As International Tensions Escalate #Ukraine #Security  
If we’re going to #war with #russia over #ukraine, I’ve got just the recruitment poster.  Let Putin know he can go ahead and—not 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗳𝘂𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱, but—𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝗳𝘂𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝘆 𝗮 𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁 𝗯𝗶𝗴 𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗰𝗸.

@FUCKALLMMsQ Prolonged face-off in #ukraine, no new deadlier variants and market will quickly regain some degree of confidence! But hell everything still can happen...
Russian invasion plan for 2022. Putin will concentrate on the region south-east of the Dnjepr.  #UkraineCrisis #Ukraine 
Media parroting anti British rhetoric of Moscow government. Very unpatriotic of our Press at a time of near war. Smacks of appeasement #Ukraine
Here’s an idea….let’s invite Russia to join NATO?! Problem solved!!🤔😉 #Putin #Ukraine #NATO @rodbishop15 @militaryhistori
Jan Egeland on Ukraine: People are exhausted, frozen and helpless - #jan_egeland #ukraine #people #russia #moscow #kyiv 
#JohnPilger is widely respected for the quality of his investigations into the politics of foreign nations. Thus his contentions are of concern. What evidence exists that govt in #Ukraine was overthrown by Obama  or that current govt is infested with #NationalSocialists?

Just seen the Klitschko brothers on ITV news at 10, looks like Putin's fucked it. 👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻 #klitschko #Ukraine
A read of excruciating immediacy on #Ukraine by @mashagessen   via @NewYorker
@senrobportman Just a reminder of how much you really care about #Ukraine #UkraineCrisis #UkraineConflict 
lol! @STVNews desperately trying to convince us that #Russia is trying to invade the #Ukraine they’ve got tanks which are only 200 miles from the border! Ha ha!! For some reason the tanks were firing shells as well - bit of dramatisation there I think #STV
@g_gosden @ThisStarChild He is probably carrying the United Kingdom nuclear weapon launch codes or location of MI6 officers in #Ukraine or #Russia 😂
#VladimirPutin getting it wrong over @NATO and #Ukraine according to newspaper for US #Military. 
This frees up space in my office, so I'm glad. I then visited the 2 ships at the NCT. They had crew from #Philippines, #India, #Russia, #Ukraine, #Romania, #SouthAfrica, &amp; #Romania. I've also gotten some of the work for the big caps thank you letter done. It's getting there.
Having just watched #Munich tonight, I fear history is repeating itself #Ukraine #boristheclown
.. Will the United States arrange a confrontation for Ukraine's interests with Britain? And the price will be what.. #war #usa #uk #Ukraine
P. sure that "Non-escalatory force posture alignment" is NATO-speak for "Fuck around and find out" #ukraine
Why are these countries not part of the #EU 🇪🇺 One can disagree on the example of #Ukraine 🇺🇦 and #Georgia 🇬🇪 
Republican Rep. #AdamKinzinger calls pro-insurrectionist Sen. #JoshHawley “one of the worst human beings” and a "self-aggrandizing con artist," after Hawley demanded that Biden reject #Ukraine from #NATO. #Republicans
What am I now? #Ukraine #NINA 
#FTA #Ukraine #Turkey: Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers approved the draft Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Turkey at a government meeting on Wednesday. 
@JackPosobiec #Ukraine    Alexander vindmen lis not making predictions. He has inside info, a decision has been made. 200,000 lbs of weapons and ammo are being sent to neo Nazis, same ones used in 2014. They are gonna be unleashed on eastern ukraine. Thank biden fo that one. 
Why don't we invite Russia to join us, and Ukraine, in the NATO? Let's all be friends. There's no need to feel threatened.  #Oekraïne #UkraineCrisis #Ukraine
