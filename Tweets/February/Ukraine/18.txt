So, war it is then in #Ukraine. The way US handled this situation is shockingly poor. A Historic failure. This marks the end of an era.
#Biden said that #Putin will invade #Ukraine but that is because #USA does Not want to stop #NATO expansion, this will allow Zelensky to drag the West into major war with #Russia period  @MunSecConf @BBCNews @EU_Commission @SecBlinken @USNATO @NATO @POTUS 
@ianbremmer I thought I was the only one, who foresees #Russia's folly in attacking #Ukraine, if it ever does; he'd be simply repeating #Hitler's overambitious antics 80+ odd years down the line. He's already made his point &amp; will only have his misplaced arrogance, to blame. #RussianIvasion
@Potus sends  @KamalaHarris to have liason with #Putin to stop #Ukraine invasion 
S,Kamran,Hasanov an expert of the #Russian council of international affairs:Russia is implementing the scenario of sending Peacekeepers to the #Donbass to protect the Civilians of #Donetsk &amp; #Lugansk,if this happens,#Ukraine WILL NOT DARE to fire another Single Shot,Novorosinform 
@FinancialTimes It is important to know your opponent, even if it is only a local power. Russia is a failed state that has nothing without gas / oil. Freeze or confiscate assets of oligarchs for #Ukraine. Putin is finished.
And then, #Crimea   And #Ukraine loses control of its Natural Gas production project in the Black Sea :-    Why would Russia want to control production from the Black Sea, one might ask ?
not much new news #ukraine

The Russian attack on #Ukraine ?  Like I said before‚Äîas soon as the #Olympics are over.
@EnterpriseLgbt ok, so just tell me  why would Russia attack Dombass if Dombass is already under russian influence? This make no sens  #ukraine

The #CCP is doing in #Myanmar what the #Kremlin is about to do to #Ukraine. Both #Xi and #Putin are in the process of expanding their empires by absorbing all the countries and peoples on their peripheries ... 
Largest Russian troop movement since WWII.  NATO needs to approve and accept the Ukraine as an emergency measure. Russia is taking back Eastern Europe piece by piece now. This is serious. Putin will not be appeased. #Russia #Ukraine #Putin #NATO #WWII 
Invade the capitalist empire and district of corruption, not #Ukraine.
