I've made my points about U.S. hypocrisy, double-standards, lies, etc. that have weakened  Biden's leadership in the face of Russian aggression. But the threat of a Russian invasion of #Ukraine  is real and it is very wrong. As was Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.

• The #US will not send troops to fight in #Ukraine if the conflict escalates. There will be sanctions.   • The start of military operations by #Russia against Ukraine will mean that #Moscow has abandoned diplomacy.
