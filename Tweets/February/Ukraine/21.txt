#ukraine had the world’s 3rd largest nuclear weapons stockpile when it gave them up as part of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum in exchange for security and guarantees about territorial integrity. What is happening today will make any other country very nervous about following suit.
February 21st may have gone down in history as one of the most tragic days in the world... Ukraine is an independent country. Today Putin invades Ukraine. And tomorrow? Our cell phone? Our house? Our country? #Ukraine #UkraineInvasion #UkraineConflict #weareallukrainians #Donbass

Smart move by Putin. Telegraph punch to ignorant media that all of #Ukraine  could be invaded. Shift gears and annex two eastern hot spots. Weak #biden leadership as well as losing 20 years of Operation: USELESS DIRT contributes to garbage U.S. diplomacy.

#Ukraine  PRESS RELEASE ABOUT JOE BIDEN  via @BitChute
@shaun_riordan @vtchakarova The recognition of the republics by #Russia is one of the two scenarios that #Ukraine and the #USA were discounting at this stage. The other scenario was hardly-opposed ethnic cleansing of #Donbas, not through killing sprees, but by making life really miserable.
Russia is simply re-drawing the map of #Ukraine … taking back majority Russian population areas ; doubt their would be any war #Putin #UkraineConflict
Where are all the "experts" who claimed #Putin would never reinvade #Ukraine?! #RussiaInvadedUkraine 
Sending my love to the people of #Ukraine 🇺🇦 You are in our thoughts and our hearts💙💛  And know the world sees the true aggressor and warmonger.
#Putin prepares to bring 'peace' to the rest of #Luhansk and #Donetsk which are still controlled by #Ukraine and not by #Russia. Putin has declare Ukraine a puppet state of the West and a fake state, legitimising further invasions. Time for sanctions is now. 
@EconguyRosie Not sure why so many dismissed idea that #Putin was going to invade. He knows that making any deals with West with its leaders who are only in office for short terms is pointless. His focus now may be on rebel occupied regions of #Ukraine but will shortly shift to wider Ukraine.
Putin’s invasion of #Ukraine is big middle finger to @NATO #Germany #France #EuropeanLeaders and @POTUS
I am extremely sad for the real Russian people, not for those in nightclubs in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but for those who build their own houses and cannot eat their fill.  #Ukraine #Україна

Pushing jabs, discrimination and mandates violates international law and the Geneva Conventions. Arrest Mahuta. #GenevaConventions #Ukraine #law #Nuremberg2TickTock 
You know, call me crazy, but I don’t think sanctions are a deterrent to #Putin .  He knows NATO isn’t going to war for #Ukraine , and he thinks he has more to gain than he could lose.
Biden sanctions #Ukraine as punishment to #Russia for invading Ukraine… Putin is laughing hes ass off rn… Well played #BidenIsALaughingstock 
@cbkwgl @SirJambavan Ah well-just wait until #Serbia moves against Kosovo/ will be fun to watch. Also, none of these Euros have the means to do jack against #Russia. If #Ukraine quietly lets go of Donbass -things will be fine. If they show aggression, the Russian Tanks will move to the Dnieper Line.
Goldman's articles and twitter posts on #Ukraine speak for themselves, and I urge readers to examine them (if they haven't already been deleted). But I think my summary ("Putin is right...") is far from inaccurate. My more extended take on Ukraine is at 
#Ukraine Biological Threat Reduction Program  #DTRA 
#StandWithUkraine  #Hongkong is ruined by #CCPChina while #Ukraine is now invaded by #Russia  We are in solidarity! 🇺🇦🇭🇰 
The #UkraineCrisis can still be resolved without full escalation. Russia has moved to secure #Donbass - one of its two goals. It has no reason to advance further, *unless* NATO moves to deploy missiles in #Ukraine. Naive? Maybe. But we shouldn't assume the worst "just because".
Language matters. Framing matters. #Ukraine Here's a video primer: 
If you've ever wondered what failing to assure your own energy independence looks like, I'd offer the current situation in #Ukraine as an example.  #energy #Russia #NordStream2
Russian President Vladimir Putin recognizes Ukraine's breakaway territories, and has ordered the deployment of troops for what the Kremlin called "peacekeeping functions"  #Ukraine #Russia 
How else can you help #Ukraine from abroad?  Write to editors and journalists if you see #UkraineCrisis, #UkraineConflict etc. Words matter! Russian disinformation and propaganda also kill.  #HelpUkraineFromAbroad 
I assume that the U.S. is making this recommendation based on their assessment of #Russia's plans in #Ukraine:  
RT - "When you describe Russian soldiers invading Ukraine right now as "peacekeepers", even when you use quotation marks, you are using language that Putin wants you to use. Call it what it is.... an invasion." #Russia #Ukraine #War #Nato #RussiaUkraineTension

American broadcaster ABC is reporting White House Sources urgently telling #Ukraine's President  @ZelenskyyUa to leave the capital Kyiv and head to the relative safety of L'viv.  The US must be 100% confident of their intel, but I'm still sceptical.  Awful conundrum for Zelenskyy
Tonight on FISM News: A new report shows some #Afghan refugees pose a potential security risk to the United States, intelligence suggests #Russia has ordered an attack on #Ukraine, and Trump's new #socialmedia app launches today. 
The #Ukraine crisis challenges the traditional meaning of state #sovereignty, and the coming days will indicate how far major powers are willing to go—to either protect it, or encroach upon it. From @AarshiTirkey.

This is direct conflict with what the White House said only weeks ago. We've gone from any Russian forces crossing into #Ukraine will be met with harsh measures - to - a major incursion all over Eastern Ukraine is not really a bid deal. 
Puti just wants a little peace. (A little piece of Donbas, a little piece of Luhansk, a little piece of #Ukraine)  [Apologies to @MelBrooks, who made the WII version rhyme and should update the song]
It's now clear what #Putin's game plan is. He recognises independence of  #Donbass region, and now openly enters #Ukraine  at his new client state's "invitation". He strikes NOW because Ukraine is not YET a member of NATO, so he expects no military response. Only sanctions.
