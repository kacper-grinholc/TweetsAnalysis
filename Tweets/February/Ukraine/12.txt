Is this #Ukraine situation giving new meaning to the term "THEATER of War"?  The war machine doesn't need an actual war to make money. In theory, they only need the SPECTER of war to drive up military contractor stock to enrich politicians &amp; those contractors more. @anthonyzenkus 
@NotWoofers @ELINTNews See since these so called self proclaimed "anti Imperialists" love dictatorships, they surely wouldn't mind living in China, NK, Russia, Syria etc? Easy to defend authoritarianism whilst living in a democratic country.  #antiimperialism #russia #ukraine #HandsOffUkraine

What's going on with #Ukraine vs #Russia. Isn't a gathering. It's known as #mobilization. That's what caused WWI. Not political! Both sides were #mobilized &amp; dug in . Ready for attack. A shot rang out. "The shot heard around the world." That's all it took. War was on! #FoxReport 
✔Any negotiated settlement of the #UkraineCrisis should never be on the basis of how much #Ukrainian territory #Russia would annex/control before it allowed the rest of #Ukraine to join the #EU &amp; #NATO as a diminutive state. #UkrainiansWillResist #UkraineWillResist #Ukrainekrise
