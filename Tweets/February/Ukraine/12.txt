Is this #Ukraine situation giving new meaning to the term "THEATER of War"?  The war machine doesn't need an actual war to make money. In theory, they only need the SPECTER of war to drive up military contractor stock to enrich politicians &amp; those contractors more. @anthonyzenkus

#BREAKING: Presidents #JoeBiden and #VladimirPutin concluded a call on the crisis in Ukraine as the White House says intelligence shows #Russia could invade. #Biden planned once again to call on Putin to pull back the Russian troops near #Ukraine‚Äôs borders.  (AP)
I can‚Äôt imagine a scenario #NS2 is going online. If Putin invades, it‚Äôs dead. And for using it against #Ukraine, it‚Äôs dead. 
Trump was just the perfect vehicle for #Putin to do his own evil things. He made it easier, but #Russians were already in #Ukraine. #Putin may not plan to reconstitute the Soviet Union, but a greater #Russia is clearly his plan. He wants to control the former Soviet republics.

#Ukraine   We're where we're at with Russia and Ukraine because NATO let Putin get away with Crimea and our Congress let Putin keep a blatant Russian operative named Trump in our Presidency after they manipulated our election in his favor.  So yeah, it's Biden's fault üôÑ

Praying for people of #Ukraine ... War is ugly.. brutal..inhuman üíî
Hey @TulsiGabbard ‚Ä¶I really hope, when this all shakes out, your connection to Russian oligarchs/Right Wing #WhiteNationalist are really going to be a problem for you.  Just sayin‚Ä¶. #GOPBetrayedAmerica #Ukraine 
"The president warned Putin that though he is still ‚Äúprepared to engage in diplomacy,‚Äù the U.S. is ‚Äúequally prepared for other scenarios.‚Äù  #JoeBiden #POTUS #Ukraine #Putin #Russia #NATO 
What's going on with #Ukraine vs #Russia. Isn't a gathering. It's known as #mobilization. That's what caused WWI. Not political! Both sides were #mobilized &amp; dug in . Ready for attack. A shot rang out. "The shot heard around the world." That's all it took. War was on! #FoxReport 
‚úîAny negotiated settlement of the #UkraineCrisis should never be on the basis of how much #Ukrainian territory #Russia would annex/control before it allowed the rest of #Ukraine to join the #EU &amp; #NATO as a diminutive state. #UkrainiansWillResist #UkraineWillResist #Ukrainekrise

Thinking of all the people in #Ukraine going to sleep tonight wondering if they may be attacked by Russia tomorrow. Wondering how they make sense of the senseless. Thinking of all Ukrainians longing for #peace right now.
#CNN #Russia #Ukraine - How Russia surrounded Ukraine on three sides  Russia has created pressure points on multiple fronts. Here's a visual guide to where an invasion could be launched.
@joebiden is capping off a long career of lying with war. #Ukraine

With fears of Russia invading #Ukraine rising by the day, several countries have urged their citizens to leave immediately Russia, too, announced it has ‚Äòoptimised‚Äô its diplomatic staff  
Putin, Macron discuss #Ukraine crisis by phone - reports -  
‚ÄúRussian units are heading from large bases into staging areas near the border. Troops are moving to link up with their equipment. Vital enablers for war, like field hospitals and engineering units, are being put into place.‚Äù #Ukraine  
If you haven‚Äôt left #Ukraine yet, you are stupid.
