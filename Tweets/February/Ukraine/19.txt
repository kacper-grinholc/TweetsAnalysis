@johnw612 @nupoint21 @your_grace25 @POLITICOEurope Indeed.  West promised not to expand #NATO. Not an inch, indeed...  We broke that promise. Now Russia finally says stop? You think the US had waited 30 years of Mexico and Texas joined Warsaw Pact?  #Ukraine #Russia
Tonight, the fiercest shelling ongoing in Donetsk front since the beginning of the current Ukraine crisis. #DPR are launching artillery strikes towards position of #Ukraine army. So far no reports of impact reported inside #Donestk.  However, the WAR has not yet begun. 
Stop it, you ghouls.  #Putin #Biden #Ukraine #Belarus #warmongering  #Zelensky 
Has #Belarus has become the role model for what #Putin would like to do with #Ukraine &amp; other sovereign states that were once under Soviet rule? #Kyiv is 90 miles from the Belarus border. #Vilnius,#Lithuania is only 20 miles from the Belarus border  #Russia
#Russia has no intention of invading #Ukraine. This is a provocation created by the British &amp; the United States Military Industrial Complex. We can't allow this to happen.    #Update #RealNews #News #Update #WWIII #MIC #War #AntiWar #TransAtlanticSystem

@MarcherMedia1 If you are going to invade #Ukraine get on with it! I can only guess two things are at play here. 1) They expected the EU to fold and not support Ukraine 🇺🇦 &amp; the Ukrainians would look to negotiate. 2) Putin has promised China not to invade until the #BeijingOlympics are over.

#Ukraine will never get this, because strategic ambiguity serves #NATO members far better than any timeline that would activate hostility or support and entrench divisions.   That said, Zelensky is likely saying this for domestic political reasons.
