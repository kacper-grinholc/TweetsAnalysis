This crisis is artificially constructed.  When #Ukraine joins #NATO. When #Ukraine attempts to bring #Crimea back. Then ... pulled into a war.  Ukraine can't join #NATO before bringing #Crimea back!  »Only states that do not bring unresolved conflicts into the alliance may join.« 
Looking at the situations around the world today like #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar #Ukraine crisis with Russia. I wouldn’t be surprised if the world ended by some crazy maniac with a lot of power with a nuke button.

"#Russia invasion of #Ukraine"🙃  Some in the #US spy community are worried about the “long term credibility” of its intelligence  "Spy world wary as #Biden team keeps leaking #Russia intel"   
Adding insult to injury, @NDP foreign affairs critic @HMcPhersonMP claims her colleague's disgusting slander of #Ukraine was retracted. It was not.  @LeahGazan only said her tweet was missing added context.  That is a doubling down. Not a retraction.  Here’s an idea. Delete it 👇
