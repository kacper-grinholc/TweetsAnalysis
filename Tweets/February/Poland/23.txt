The past week the US Army sent 5,700 fresh 82nd Airborne Division troops via Rzeszów Airport into Southeastern #Poland. US soldiers set up camp at the small airstrip of Zamość, 80km from Ukraine, as well - which can accommodate helicopter ops. #military
According to @DrPMarkiewicz, "Canada and #Poland are two of #Ukraine’s most important transatlantic allies and partners." In the context of greater Russian aggression, Warsaw &amp; Ottawa can work together to strengthen transatlanticism in the region. #cdnpoli

I reported here that #Poland's cases started falling a while ago. Today confirmation the death rate's heading down too. Wednesday usually the worst day for reporting of #Covid19 fatalities and 360 more today, but that's 14 fewer than last week and the 2nd successive fall.
#Poland lifts most COVID-19 restrictions from March 1; masks stay 
#Poland preparing for #refugees, says worst-case scenario could see up to 1 million people arriving from #Ukraine in case of a full-scale #Russian invasion. #Hungary sending troops to border too, partly for refugees. #Romania is considering refugee camps.   
German Environmental Minister Steffi Lemke while visiting Poland: "Poland's will to have nuclear power plants is neither good nor safe." She mentioned to take this up on EU level. #nuclear #Poland #energy

TL;DR #Afghanistan 2022 Summary, Bleak. Especially for the women, or half the 38 million souls. Approximately the same population as #Poland and tad under #Ukraine’s 44 million.  
As per Astrological Analysis;  After #Ukraine - #Poland will be the next.. then #england and #European countries.
Migrants are not all the same for #Poland (and the #EU): 'Ready to accept 1 million Ukrainians'.  .. a few thousand asylum seekers on the border with #Belarus have been turned away in the name of the risk of a new migration wave. At least 21 people died
European countries prepare for #refugees from #Ukraine   Ukraine shares land borders with four EU countries – #Romania, #Slovakia, #Hungary and #Poland. Poland "quite well prepared to welcome a lot of Ukrainians"  [ but - none from other countries? why?]
