A very bold move Sir @JFLopezAguilar , that will serve as a model for other European member states! It is hoped that the two countries will soon take effective steps to avoid these suspensions in accordance with #EU rules. #Poland #Hungary #NextGenarationEU 
Ah, finally, the EU has teeth and doesn't let the principles which makes us strong (united in diversity) be trampled without consequences. Poland and Hungary now need to think about their desire to be team players or free riders.   #poland #hungary #Europe

Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has announced that a ministerial task force will be set up in the coming days to prepare for a potential influx of Ukrainian refugees amid lingering fears of hostilities breaking out between Russia and Ukraine.  #UkraineCrisis #Poland
#Poland and #Hungary losing their court battle to the #EuropeanCourt #EU they would be better off to leave that crooked alliance like #Britain did and #Brexit that shit
The EU #RuleOfLaw argument against #Hungary and #Poland is plainly ridiculous. It risks mobilizing political forces against a "rule of law" that has degenerated into a purely left-liberal ideological concept.
