Given that the whole EU project was a political project from the start, was this not clear to people like Victor Orban? Did they not read the member statutes or did they not understand them? Way to go, geniuses. Did not understand what they signed up for. #Hungary #Poland #EU

NGOs urge #EU ministers to act decisively on #Poland's rule of law crisis 
@EUCourtPress @Europarl_EN @EUCouncil Dear #Poland and #Hungary, please begin finally the Exit. Nobody in Europe need such a totalitarian antidemocratic regime of technocrats and lobbyists as #EU. They destroyed my country #Greece, now they want to destroy also you. Stay strong.

Today's EUCJ decision paves the way for the EU Commission to cut funds to #Poland and #Hungary unless they address rule of law issues. What now?  Check this 🧵by @DemocracyR colleague @J_Jaraczewski arguing that the Commission won't react quickly (surprise, surprise) 👇 
🇵🇱 🇭🇺 The #EU's 🇪🇺 top court on Wednesday dismissed a challenge from #Poland and #Hungary over claims they violated democratic rights.  This surprised some, noting Poland's increased importance amid the crisis in neighbouring #Ukraine 🇺🇦.  FRANCE 24's @DaveKeating ⤵️

@sumlenny Additionally, some companies forbid Ukrainians to move to #Poland (which is the only country in #EU allowing Ukrainians to work 90days with tourist visa) to avoid problems with taxation. Tho #Ukraine #Poland have bilateral agreement of avoiding double-taxation. Disgusting!

A historic judgement. If not for legal reasons, for political purposes 🎓 #RuleOfLaw #EUBudget #CJEU #Hungary #Poland 
Spring temperatures today on and off the slopes, good sledging in the park weather 🛷🛷🛷 and fun soft snow on the slopes 👌 #sledging #zakopane #familyholiday #poland @ Zakopane 
#Hungary said the verdict showed Brussels' abuse of power, while #Poland called it an attack on its sovereignty.  
A work in progress! Mecalux is setting up a high-rise ecommerce warehouse in #Poland featuring a massive pick tower. Exciting to see this fantastic project take shape! #logistics #ecommerce #mecalux #warehouses

EU top court paves way to cut billions to #Poland and #Hungary for violating democratic rights and #RuleOfLaw  Hungary and Poland have been rapidly backsliding on #media freedom, #LGBT rights, independence of #judges, the #RightToProtest  
Allegations that human rights defenders have been threatened at the Polish-Belarusian border, including media workers and interpreters.  🇵🇱#Poland must investigate all harassment allegations and grant border access to journalists and humanitarian workers.   
"The Court dismisses the actions brought by #Hungary and #Poland in their entirety". 
#China, #Russia, #Hungary, #Poland and also the #RepublicanParty in the #US redefined #Democracy as #Dictatorship by and for the people and promise to fight for and protect this #NewDemocracy also against the people.

#Poland and #Hungary should also leave the corrupt and #warmongering #NATO as well.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has announced that a ministerial task force will be set up in the coming days to prepare for a potential influx of Ukrainian refugees amid lingering fears of hostilities breaking out between Russia and Ukraine.  #UkraineCrisis #Poland
#Poland and #Hungary losing their court battle to the #EuropeanCourt #EU they would be better off to leave that crooked alliance like #Britain did and #Brexit that shit
The EU #RuleOfLaw argument against #Hungary and #Poland is plainly ridiculous. It risks mobilizing political forces against a "rule of law" that has degenerated into a purely left-liberal ideological concept.

#Poland and #Hungary must accept destructively asocial #Wokism or lose EU funding. Perfect reason to leave....    
Precedent for “ALL” Members States!  President @vonderleyen and her @EU_Commissionis pushed to act and take action by President @EP_President @RobertaMetsola as it is the position of the entire EP House @Europarl_EN   #RuleOfLaw #Hungary #Poland #conditionality #EUBudget 
The stuff they keep out of all history classes.   Every felt you’d watch or hear something that would raise your hairs in a good way, coming from Hitler?   #Hitler #Nazi #Germany #WW2 #Poland  
A heavy defeat for the governments of #Poland and #Hungary: European Court of Justice declined Polish and Hungarian actions against #RuleOfLaw mechanism.
