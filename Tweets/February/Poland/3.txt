More cooperation between #Ukraine and #Poland on infrastructure projects: 🇺🇦 Denys Shmyhal (Ukrainian Prime Minister) met 🇵🇱 Mateusz Morawiecki (Polish Prime Minister)  🏗️ @zwyklyPolak @MissPaszkowska @StowNIGDYWIECEJ @KresySiberia @galarnik @YarlYOMSBORG 
It would appear Russia has deployed to Belarus multiple Krasukha-4 EW units. If Russia decides to escalate, these units can disrupt EW (NATO/AWACS/JSTARS) aircraft, which would provide recon &amp; intel to Ukraine in such a scenario. #Ukraine #WW3 #Poland #USA #WW2 #awacs @swentol 
On the day that #US downgraded the threat of Russia invading #Ukraine, Biden sent 2,000 troops to #Poland &amp; 1,000 troops to #Romania.  Ukraine is a tool for the US regime to destabilise Eastern #Europe.  A good distraction from the Covid19 fiasco at home. 
The alternative corridor would allow trains from #Ukraine to enter #Poland through one of the two or three border crossings, and from Poland to #Lithuania through the Trakiszki-Mockava border crossing 
Andrej Nosko practically admitted that there was an unfair and biased campaign against #Hungary  and #Poland.  🇵🇱🇭🇺 @mno_hu #Soros #OSF #Hungary #Poland  
The European Court of #HumanRights has today found a "systemic dysfunction in the judicial appointments procedure in #Poland".  @ECHR_CEDH press release:     #FairTrials #ECHR 
➡ #Poland and #Czech negotiators have reached a deal on the contentious #Turów lignite mine at the two countries' shared border, Polish state news agency PAP reported on Thursday, citing an anonymous source. 
The #UnitedStates will send nearly 3,000 extra troops to #Poland and #Romania to shield Eastern Europe from a potential spillover from the crisis over the massing of #Russian troops near #Ukraine, U.S. officials said.  Read more: 
A great way for Minister @AnitaAnandMP and the #Trudeau government to bolster #Canada deployment to #NATO Eastern Flank would be cooperating with or even joining the multinational @MNBHQ constituting 🇱🇹🇵🇱🇺🇦 soldiers based in Lublin #Poland 
@MarinaPurkiss Liz #Truss might have known about #Kaliningrad. On the #Baltic Sea (not the #Black one). In interesting #Russian enclave between #Lithuania and #Poland. Missile site.... #Putin is all about destabilising the Baltic states. Liz Truss would know about them of course.... 
Poland’s border wall to cut through Europe’s last old-growth forest  Work has begun on a 116-mile long fence on the Polish-Belarusian border. Scientists call it an environmental “disaster.”  🇵🇱   🌳    #environment #forest #Europe #Poland #nature 
As in the 1920s/30s, you also get passionate, polarized views on who is to blame. There are those who see #Putin as #Hitler and Ukraine as the Sudetenland – or #Poland There are those who see the ‘US Deep State’ driving things. And both can be true, which just makes matters worse
The Advocate General of the EU Court of Justice says #Poland's extension of the #Turow mine was against EU rules. The opinion will likely weigh heavily in favour of the #Czech lawsuit when the court rules.  
Very important development in #Turow case. #ECJ #AG confirming that #Poland infringed #EULaw.   I expect @EU_Commission to take this seriously and finally stand firm on #RuleofLaw. Words are not enough. We need to see action otherwise #EU laws will be seen not worth the paper.  
4/4 #USA moved forces to #Germany #Poland &amp; #Romania USA resisting to share power-podium with other economic &amp; military powers. Hence #War is the option to delay it Wishes cannot change course of history @nytimes @BBC @CNN @guardianworld @RT_com @PDChina @AJEnglish @StateDept
Biden Sending More Troops to Eastern Europe Amid Russia Tensions 2,000 troops will go to #Germany and #Poland, another 1,000 soldiers will be transferred from Germany to #Romania by Dave DeCamp @DecampDave #Ukraine #Russia #NATO #EasternEurope   … 
#ECJ #AG Pikamäe: by extending the authorisation for #lignite mining in the #Turów mine by six years without carrying out an environmental impact assessment, #Poland infringed #EUlaw #CzechRepublic #environment 👉
Weather update for #Poland: Light Rain tomorrow, and as for the government - they're still, to no one's surprise, a bunch of assholes.  Come back tomorrow for another #weatherupdate.
The United States will send nearly 3,000 extra troops to #Poland and #Romania to shield Eastern Europe from a potential spillover from the crisis over the massing of Russian troops near #Ukraine, US officials said on Wednesday (2 February).
➡️ #Poland’s President Andrzej Duda expects to meet with the leaders of #Germany and #France next week to discuss the situation around #Ukraine.
➡️ Washington's decision to send more troops to #Poland, #Romania and #Germany amid fears of a Russian invasion of #Ukraine is a symbol of allied unity and a warning to Putin against taking any further military action, the Polish prime minister has said.
➡️ The #US will send 1,700 extra troops to #Poland and around 1,000 to #Romania to reassure its Eastern European #NATO allies amid fears of a Russian invasion of #Ukraine, the Pentagon announced on Wednesday.
In #EasternExpress we spoke with former Polish ambassador to #Ukraine @JanPieklo about the new alliance between Ukraine, #Poland, and the #UK. 
An interesting challenge directly aimed at the weak cohesion within the #EU. The UK amplifies de facto #Poetin’s efforts to further divide and geopolitically weaken the #EU. Will #Poland take centre stage in UK’s circumvention of the #Brexit agreement? @2eKamertweets @EersteKamer
