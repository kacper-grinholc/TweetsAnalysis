#US to send extra 3,000 troops to #Poland amid Ukraine-Russia crisis. 
The question is not how to save #Ukraine!  But how to protect #Poland from Russian invasion, obviously the direction of tanks &amp; cannons in Belarus are heading to westward !!
@StandSure8 @FrederikDTunnat @EndGameWW3 That could be why 5000 of the 82nd are now in #Poland. #Russia #Ukraine #NATO
1/ Can today's threat against #Ukraine be compared with the 1980 Soviet invasion threat against Communist #Poland ?  An interesting article, worth reading.  Interesting that there was weak and inappropriate reasoning by #Germany and #France in 1980. 
Weather update for #Poland: Mostly Sunny tomorrow, and as for the government - they're still, to no one's surprise, a bunch of assholes.  Come back tomorrow for another #weatherupdate.
Nice to see that #Poland is in the top three countries with the highest #GDP growth forecasts in the upcoming years 
A close family member is going to #Poland next week for a few days. Should I be worried? #UkraineCrisis

You may not like Mateusz Morawiecki, but the PM of #Poland is entirely right about Europe's leaders not having the integrity to stand up to Putin.  Europe’s leaders lack the courage to stand up to the Kremlin during the greatest crisis since the Cold War
