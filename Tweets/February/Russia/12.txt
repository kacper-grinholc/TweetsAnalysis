@jesseKawell @ArsenyOlivari @PolymathBull @amoslim @McFaul But I do, because it's crucially important for today. #Russia has ZERO incentive or desire to march into #Ukraine! Crimea was immensely important, militarily and from a geostrategic pov. Ukraine today is an economic basket case that Russia happily lets the EU to fully own.

#Russia and the #USA should stop fighting each other in other people's countries.

Interesting: number of #Republicans who view #Russia as an enemy has risen in recent years. How come so many #GOP voters are still strongly behind #Trump , a notorious "friend" of the autocratic #Putin + Putin's Russia? 
Here's the thing: If he is pushed back again, will the people of #Russia actually rise up similar to other oppressed around the world and physically pull him out of office? My guess is yes and my hope is they'll handle up w/ him like Nicolae Ceaușescu was in Romania in the 90s.

What a shocker. That #Russia-#Trump Collusion bit was obviously a hoax. Anyone with at least 3 functioning brain cells could see that. All those involved should be put behind the bars. 
The @WhiteHouse didn’t announce any material progress in deescalating the tension between #Russia and #Ukraine after President Biden held an hour-long call with Putin.  The Epoch Times reached out to the White House for comment. 
#BREAKING: Presidents #JoeBiden and #VladimirPutin concluded a call on the crisis in Ukraine as the White House says intelligence shows #Russia could invade. #Biden planned once again to call on Putin to pull back the Russian troops near #Ukraine’s borders.  (AP)
Trump was just the perfect vehicle for #Putin to do his own evil things. He made it easier, but #Russians were already in #Ukraine. #Putin may not plan to reconstitute the Soviet Union, but a greater #Russia is clearly his plan. He wants to control the former Soviet republics.

Both the #MinskAgreements have nothing in there that allows #Donbas or #Crimea to "break away" or "autonomy" with #Russia in fact "decentralization" is meticulously described. It explicitly states any "mercenaries" to explicitly "pull-out" and any "illegal" armed groups.(#10) 
#Russia states the #UnitedStates hasn't forced #Ukraine to abide by the #MinskAgreements but #Russia is trying to reframe the agreements with "autonomy" claims with conflicted regions, and this is disingenuous, in addition they've been violating the agreements along w/mercenaries

The world is closer to #war (#NUCLEAR)between #Russia &amp; #imperialism than at anytime since SU collapse. Russia is NOT the #SovietUnion.  The #USA #NATO are forcing war vs #Russia. The imperialist #media is compliant in lying that Russia is the aggressor. DOWN with #Imperialism!
@WhiteHouse #Russia has no plans at all to invade but grandpa #Biden promotes his narrative by provoking until irritation levels reach a top that they hit back.Just that is what the #US wants so they can prove their ‘right’.  #Bidens dementia erased his memory of #USwarcrimes
🇷🇺#Russia Ambassador Matsegora met with #NorthKorea Deputy Foreign Minister Im Cheon-Il in Pyongyang on Monday to discuss the international situation in the context of events around 🇺🇦#Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula  Did he try to put the #DPRK in a box¿ You are not allowed to

@thewiretwo @SimonOstrovsky Difference is #Russia has no desire to conquer #Ukraine while #crimea was of utmost strategic importance. Russia has neither the means nor incentive to finance this basket case. Nato membership:Russia can do zilch. But they can/will take down any missile launching sites from afar
Don’t ignore #Russia-#China collusion or (possibly joint) efforts to use #cryptocurrency #blockchains to undermine #sanctions regimes as #Iran is doing w/ #Chinese help. 
I’ve got the deepest respect for @Snowden until this moment   Putin is about to trigger WWIII and #Snowden has nothing to say about the aggression against the coming #UkraineInvasion   It might be time to block @Snowden and his bias for #Russia   @YourAnonNews

Here's something to ponder... IF #Biden lets the #USA get into a war with #Russia, it will be run by the same generals and #PENTAGON    leaders who couldn't defeat the #Taliban.
I'm not sure if this is happening now but hearings reports of military activity in eastern #Ukraine... #PrayForPeace 🙏  #Ukraine #Russia #Europe #USA
We're living in the #WWE: after #Russia throws #NATO into the top rope, #China will jump in the ring and dropkick NATO on the sly. While everyone is watching Russia and the #Ukraine, China will invade #Taiwan. They are working together and this is the ultimate power play. Watch. 
If they don’t reach any agreement we will sure see nukes at some point! #Russia #UnitedStates 
#Germany's relationship with #Russia against #Ukraine goes way back to Schroder funding him with #NordStream2 Are they a reliable #NATO ally? #SanctionNordStream #StopRussianAggression Putin and Schröder: A special German-Russian friendship under attack 
So the hot topic re #Ukraine and #Russia military stratergy-ists tonight is…

From #Finland:    All this is now known about the situation in #Ukraine: Biden warned Putin of the consequences of the attack - the Kremlin says "hysteria has reached its peak"   #UkraineCrisis #Ukraine #Russia
#PrayForPeace 🙏  #Ukraine #Russia #Europe #USA. #Poland is opening the borders for #US citizens who wants to leave the country now, but can't leave via airline carriers. 
Russian diplomats are leaving Ukraine now. The war is really close on starting. Just one call away from Putin to let it happen. Call with Biden also failed. No point of return anymore. To many soldiers at the frontline. Putin doesn't want to lose faces #UkraineInvasion #Russia
The United States sent 3,000 additional troops to #Poland, and USAF  F-22 Raptor's as Russia held military exercises in Belarus and the Black Sea following the buildup of its forces near Ukraine. "#Russia #Ukraine #Donbas"
