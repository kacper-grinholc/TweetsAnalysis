Well done Keith - standing shoulder to shoulder with #Johnson against #Russia #WhatATool  You can both be at the front on the Ukrainian/Russian border and we'll make room for you both at the Fletcher Memorial Home if you make it through #incurabletyrants  
@maxseddon @ElenaChernenko Intelligence is not a word associated with Liz Truss. The whole cabinet has a collective IQ in single figures but Truss is outstanding at zero on the Kelvin scale. Absolute imbecile making the UK a laughing stock around the world.   #LizTruss #UKRAINE #Russia
Russia and Kazakhstan signed 11 cooperation agreements #Russia #Kazakhstan  
#Russia’s MoD cancelled the NOTAM for the Sea of Azov which was blocking commercial cargo to all ports, in both Russia and #Ukraine. But it added more areas in the Black Sea, with Ukraine’s ports effectively blocked for 13-19 February:

It’s a propaganda echo chamber, just like “Saddam has weapons of mass destruction.” None of them are credible. #Russia 
Today, #Russia engaged in major military exercises in  #Belarus, closed off large swathes of the Black Sea, and Lavrov said talk with Truss was "dialogue of the deaf."  Not a good day for #Ukraine.  Interview with @cnni @HalaGorani @cepa

Let’s be #real Geopolitically speaking, it’s imperative for #russia to prevent #nato which is designed against Russia , from expanding to The Russian border.  The #west tried to subjugate 🇷🇺 for centuries now. Don’t expect them not to push back! #Ukraine should be pragmatic.
#russia cheated before and they're cheating now! The Olympics are such a fucking sham. @Olympics support genocide. They allow doping of minors for Russia.  @Russia is a joke and it is led by a clown (who everyone says enjoys the penis...#PenisPutin) 
Can everyone calm down. Even I know #Russia would need 750 thousand troops to invade #Ukraina #Truss #deadcat
The French want to ignore everything that happened before two months ago? I don’t think “going back to 1997” is strange in the slightest. #Russia

@JackyBrown_007 @JulianRoepcke @golub @AlexKokcharov If #Russia occupies more of #Ukraine, what will happen next? #Putin is never going to be able to control Ukrainians the way he does with obedient Russians, he is not welcome there and now the locals are well armed + sanctions - It would be a suicide for his regime
