Far-right: Exists purely to discredit #Ukraine in the eyes of the West. You’d almost wonder if they’re pro-#Russia. Hmm…  Javelin: First anti-tank missile nominated for canonization.

#Russia: “Gas station,” but also a “riddle” and “regional power,” but also dangerous agenda-setter.   Volodymyr Zelensky: Comedy actor turned reality TV actor.  Vladimir Putin: Small man with big tables and bigger nukes. What’s he compensating for?
