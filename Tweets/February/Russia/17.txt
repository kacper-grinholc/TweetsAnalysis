#Germany invaded 'along the entire length of the #Russia border from the #Baltic to the #BlackSea' - @BBCTwo #RiseoftheNazis.  This is what #Russians have in their national memory &amp; dictates their sense of vulnerability on Western borders @NATO #UkraineCrisis
@PattyMurray Very true On the other hand neither #China or #Russia have any empathy for the rest of humanity when it comes to #ClimateCrisis 
If the #Russian Federation says that they have no intentions whatsoever of invading #Ukraine at all, I would love the opportunity to get #Putin and #Lavrov in #Russia to explain this to the international community… 
I assume #Russia will make a heavy strike from multiple directions, but then I don't see how #Ukraine can defend from it, even with weapons provided by NATO and partners. Ukraine needs weeks to bring troops to defending positions.  2/2
