@shaun_riordan @vtchakarova The recognition of the republics by #Russia is one of the two scenarios that #Ukraine and the #USA were discounting at this stage. The other scenario was hardly-opposed ethnic cleansing of #Donbas, not through killing sprees, but by making life really miserable.
Seems appropriate #Putin #PutinsWar #Russia 
#Putin prepares to bring 'peace' to the rest of #Luhansk and #Donetsk which are still controlled by #Ukraine and not by #Russia. Putin has declare Ukraine a puppet state of the West and a fake state, legitimising further invasions. Time for sanctions is now.

Russian President Vladimir Putin recognizes Ukraine's breakaway territories, and has ordered the deployment of troops for what the Kremlin called "peacekeeping functions"  #Ukraine #Russia 
I assume that the U.S. is making this recommendation based on their assessment of #Russia's plans in #Ukraine:  
RT - "When you describe Russian soldiers invading Ukraine right now as "peacekeepers", even when you use quotation marks, you are using language that Putin wants you to use. Call it what it is.... an invasion." #Russia #Ukraine #War #Nato #RussiaUkraineTension

#Putin's grown deranged. However it's not the recognition itself but #Russia's any ties&amp;relations - unapproved by #Ukraine - with LDPR what's inadmissible.  This mess'd 've never happened if Kyiv'd allowed the Russian language and gubernatorial elections in those regions in 2014.
