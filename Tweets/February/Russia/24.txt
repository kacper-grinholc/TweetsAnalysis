@POTUS America will always be a beacon of HOPE for the world as long as we stand for people's freedom and democratic values. The time to stand WITH Ukraine and AGAINST Putin is now. 🇺🇦🇺🇲 #Ukraine #Russia #Putin
Ukrainians and Ukraine supporters gather in freezing rain in front of the White House in Washington DC for a protest against the Russian invasion.  #Ukraine #Russia #WhiteHouse #protest 
Shout out to those brave enough in #Russia to publicly oppose the Putin regime’s war on #Ukraine. It would’ve been great to see that same courage in countries like #Ethiopia, where elites openly celebrate that country’s war on #Tigray.  #StandWithUkraine #StandWithTigray 
In Moscow Russia, 600 people protesting against the war were detained  #RussiaUkraineConflict #Kharkiv #Kyiv #RussiaUkraine #Russia #Ukraine 
We attempted to warn the world with this painting, depicting Putin as a new Darth Vader, last Christmas (2021), but failed. It's too late now.  #helmort #Russia #ukraine #RussiaUkraine #RussiaInvadedUkraine #russians #ukranian #war #conflict  #peace #StopRussianAggression

Everybody I have ever met hated Russia or CCCP. Many reasons like freedom, business, lies, military. Few semi plus opinions I've ever heard were from the communist fans in the west. After this, will there exist a true fan of this country? #russia #ukraine #communist #putin
Poll: Agree or Disagree? -&gt; Putin is taking a page out of Trump’s playbook - do something that the civilized world believes is unthinkable and people won’t know what to do or be prepared to respond. #Ukraine #Russia #RussiaUkraineConflict #russianinvasion
Dear all UN/NATO countries. You are wasting your time imposing sanctions on #Russia. You might as well use a chocolate fireguard. Putin is not going to take a blind bit of notice #PrayForUkraine #CommunistBastards #PrayingForUkraine
@DDERSS @ChristopherJM @amberinzaman Again: You obviously swallowed all that propaganda.  The only "installed" regime here is #Putin 's. Not even the people of #Russia are behind him and are taking to the streets with anti-war messages despite the potential repercussions.  In other words: You. Are. Losing.

"#Russia's full-scale invasion of #Ukraine will ripple throughout the global economy in many ways, but one immediate concern is that it could send food prices soaring in some parts of the world. That's because Russia is the world's largest wheat exporter..." @gzeromedia 
#Ukraine’s Parliament, banks and offices are being “bombarded by waves” of cyber attacks as #Russia invades the Eastern European nation — hitting #Kyiv, other cities and military bases with airstrikes and shelling early Thursday morning.  Full Story:

Cui bono?  Who benefits from the Russian invasion of Ukraine? a) USA b) USA c) USA d) Not Ukraine  This invasion could've been avoided easily, but no, there's money to be made when there is war, especially when Russia is involved.  Poor Ukraine! #RussiaUkraine #Russia #Ukraine
@groo_on @janfromdevon @RhonddaBryant It was hard to tell by your tweet that you were aware. For those that are not aware this will help them understand that the Red Army was not a monolith. In fact Ukrainians within the Red Army played a big role in liberating Auschwitz. Again Putin doesn’t like this either. #Russia

#Russia needs to be isolated from the rest of the world like #Cuba was embargoed by the US in 1962. But this time it needs to be a global embargo. Absolutely no exports to Russia, no free world citizens can visit it, no free world money going to Russia.
All we want is PEACE!  #Russia #Ukraine #PeaceOnTheWorld 
Have seen discussions about impacts of #Russia/#Ukraine wheat on Middle East food supplies. More specifically, these were the sources of #Yemen's wheat imports in 2019. Yemen is highly dependent on wheat imports, a political economic fact long-criticized even before the war 
@DSchlorp @Krypto_Ekonomix @ABCWorldNews #Russia will be fine.   Do you think #Putin didn't anticipate there'd be "American posturing" before going into the #Ukraine?  Sorry to tell you this—the USA isn't the superpower it once was, nor does it have any real influence anymore.  P.S. Kennedy did flip his shit over Cuba.
#Russia is bigger than #Ukraine, #Russia can take on 5/6 countries at a time but it most definitely can’t take one the whole world🧐 So why doesn’t the #world step up and breach international laws like #russia did to teach #russia a lesson and to help defend the #Ukranians?
EXACTLY !! #facts #BidenIsADisgrace #Ukraine #biden #Russia #Putin 
Europe says that Russia has made a direct attack on the sovereignty of a country. Okay, but Isr.ael has been doing the same thing for decades, mas.sacring the civilian population of Palestine and annexing their territory.  #RussiaUkraineConflict  #Russia #Ukraine
How comical is it that #Russia is called to chair a meeting of the #UnitedNations #SecurityCouncil that was called because it invaded #Ukraine! Nothing could have illustrated how utterly useless and ineffective the whole structure has become.

SPREAD ALL THE FOOTAGE OF RUSSIAN MILITARY ATROCITIES TO THE CITIZENS OF #RUSSIA. SHOW THEM WHAT THEIR LEADERS ARE DOING TO #UKRAINE! 
Putin knows he can never effect regime change and install a pro-#Russia leader in Kyiv with brute force. Coercion and laborious disinformation campaigns might have done it, never an invasion. But he can surely wreck the country. #UkraineInvasion #Ukraine

@james_rogers fully agree. More support is needed.  The more kit #Russia loses, the better for #Ukraine, for #Europe, for everyone.

This thread shows protests across #Russia to #PutinsWar … mention of protests in 44 cities across Russia. Here analysts discuss “can Putin hold #Ukraine if they occupy” but let’s hope it’s more “can Putin hold the Russian people” - this is not a popular war. 
Time to change leader. Not in #Ukraine but #Russia. Whether it’s a military coup or a bullet in the back of the head remains to be seen.  #Turpo

Wasn't gonna say anything about #Ukraine and #Russia as I try and not be political here but...  Innocent lives lost and unnecessary violence. It's making me angry that it's lead to this...WAR.   Humans: Most intelligent species...bullshit.   Let's make the mistake a third time
