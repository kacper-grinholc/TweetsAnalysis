Is it just me or does #russia invading #ukraine seem like a poorly planned, staffed and executed campaign?   Makes me wonder if Russian military is really this bad or if this is all some kind of decoy for a more sinister plan‚Ä¶ thoughts?ü§î  #RussiaUkraineCrisis #UkraineRussianWar 
#Muslims lands have been attacked non stop without any international outcry. The UN supported these invasions. For example anytime a case of War crimes was brought to the #UN a country would veto it. Now #Russia is using the veto in the UN. What goes around comes around.
@deniizeriis it does not look good. #NATO basically said they will send a mean cease and desist letter to #Russia telling them to stop attacking. Let hope this ends in a day or two.
Yes, it was. The worst cases for #Russia are when they just are ignored. #Putin‚Äôs entire power is based on attention and compensatory behaviour 
Forget about #SWIFT, the West just activated the real nuclear financial weapon by sanctioning Russia's central bank. This means #Russia won't be able to deploy a very big chunk of its forex war chest. #Ukraine
Why is there no press in Ukraine? #UkraineWar  #RussiaUkraineWar  #Ukrania  #Russia  #RussiaUcraina  #Turkey  #Press

@KatyOnMSNBC @stengel @KatyTurNBC @BarackObama @StateDept @cnnbrk @CNN @NBCNews @NATO @EUCouncil World leaders are terrified that Putin will start a NUCLEAR WAR if other countries get involved with their military. üåç @NATO is about AVOIDING WAR. It is easy to yell for soldiers to get involved but hard for a son or daughter not come back home. War is horrible #Ukraine #Russia
Radical Islamist cleric Sadiq al-#Gharyani said #Russia had a history of racism and killing Muslims, and now sent its armies to #Libya.   
Time For #Russia's Own People To Take Out #VladimirPutin From Power  #Russians And #Ukrainians Should Not Have To DIE In A WAR That Is Only For The Personal Pride Of It's "Leader"  Where Is THIS COURAGE Among The People Of #Russia To Do The Right Thing ???  #–Ω–µ—Ç–≤–æ–π–Ω–µ 
Though I love my country dearly, I wish the USA would drop the teenage cheerleader mindset about it all "me, me, me."   The mental midgets in our political parties can't pass up a catastrophe without politicizing it.   - K  #Ukraine #UkraineRussiaWar #Russia #IStandWithUkraine

@Msbmoran Poor kid... he probably has no idea why #Russia is at war with #Ukraine ... am sure there are many #russiansoldiers that are confused. Unfortunately many are blind and just following the leader and doing what they are told.
Europeans are trying to calculate every measure against #Russia, introducing half measures such as expelling only a few Russian banks from the Swift code, meanwhile Ukrainians are fighting for their lives. This is not the time to calculate, #Europe is at war!
@SvenErikAnderse @elonmusk The users would have to have a receiver, or an aerial access point setup in a given area.  Not probable in hostile #Russia.
