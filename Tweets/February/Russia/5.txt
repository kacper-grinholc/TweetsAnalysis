UK and France agree Nato must ‘unite against Russian aggression’   #russia #news 
#Russia has in place about 70% of the combat power it believes it would need for a full-scale invasion of #Ukraine  
@AJEnglish Hopefully one day we can see #Ukraine is one part of #Russia

RT:  Meanwhile in #Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says no one should believe Ned Price or the State Department. Are you convinced?   — Julia Davis (@JuliaDavisNews) Feb 5, 2022
Not sure I get these moves by #NATO or #USA . #Russia  supposedly has 120k troops on border. How will a few thousands of troops going to deter #Putin? #UkraineConflict is not an #American problem. 
Not only Italy,but the whole world 🌍 should stop corporating with Ethiopia 🇪🇹, unless stands on a path of peace, allow humanitarian assistance to 7 million people. #Iran @Turkey_UN, #ChinaExposed #Russia must stop supporting #TigrayGenocide @POTUS @_AfricanUnion @UNHumanRights  
And more #Russia forces are on the move. Some interesting insight here by ⁦@phildstewart⁩ ⁦@humeyra_pamuk⁩ ⁦@Reuters⁩  #Ukraine  
From 23 to 26 January, French Air Force Mirage 2000s were mobilised to monitor the Russian intelligence vessel "Vasiliy Tatischchey" in the Mediterranean. #NATO #Russia 
If the Ukrainian forces act like the Afghans in 2021   it will be an easy match, but if they act like the Finnish forces in 1939 it will, ask Stalin.. Finland is the bravest country in the Nordic! !  #Finland #Russia #salla #tolvojärvi #suomussalmi #suomi
This #Russia &amp; #UkraineConflict situation comes dn to this, stone-cold reality: if US sticks w pos of keeping NATO expansion open to Kyiv, Russia likely invades. We do Ukraine ppl no favors by ignoring reality. I explain why/how in detail: @defpriorities

In Russia, Rex can't chase Daisy in the yard for no reason. He can do so only due to Bewegung des Weltgeistes #Weltgeist #Weltschmerz #Russia

Hello Everyone, 1/6) This is an interesting #news story. Last place I would want to be trained for possible combat. Ukrainian Troops Use Chernobyl Ghost Town For Training Exercises  #Ukraine #Russia #Chernobyl #Troops #Training
Russian SU-25SM attack aircraft have been moved from #Russia to #Belarus for what Russia and Belarus are calling '#exercises' but West suspects may be an ever-growing #invasion force near #Ukrainian borders. SU-25SM would be paramount for an invasion. 
I’m no Russian, nor a Russian spy, but I think #JoeBiden’s approach to #Russia is pure idiocy.  He’s a light weight in a heavyweight match.    Biden officials say those questioning US approach to Ukraine are spouting Russian disinformation #Potus.

From some perspectives, Russia has indeed tasted the sweetness in Crimea.  Russia believes that Ukraine is simply unable to withstand its force, while Washington, NATO and the European Union are already weak. …#EU #NATO #USA #Ukraine #Russia 
How many times has the #US said ‘just trust us’ and then lied? In a single day, two members of the American #press asking for clarification and evidence from the Biden administration were painted as sympathizers of #Russia and ISIS.
#Russia moved an unknown number of Sukhoi Su-25SM fighter #jets into #Belarus days before a planned military manoeuvre in the country, the Defence Ministry in Moscow said on Saturday.

#Putin will take #Ukraine and the #USA will do nothing. Neither will #NATO Also, the  Sanctions won’t hurt #Russia. They won’t need the dollar with what’s coming. 
Why #Russia'n food will never be fast food, like McCrap?

I don’t know why everyone is so worked up about Joe Rogan. Russia and China are making moves to take over the world. We should worry about Ukraine and Taiwan being invaded soon. #JoeRoganExperience #JoeRogan #Russia #China #UkraineConflict #Taiwan 
Russian ‘False Flag’ Ukraine Plot Wouldn’t Be Its First  #Russia #Ukraine #Belarus #Beijing #war #Military
I think that the world has entered into a new era! #China has for the first time backed #Russia's rejection of any future #NATO expansion. In a joint statement with #Putin, #XiJinping  voiced his support for Moscow's call for "security guarantees" from #US &amp; #NATO. #MyPhoto 
@business @bopinion That wasn't #Russia, that was the #SovietUnion. Meanwhile, we didn't fare any better in Afghanistan. The Soviet-backed Kabul government lasted years after the Soviet Union, and WAY longer than the US-backed Kabul government.
As it balances China’s rise &amp; builds a strategic partnership with US, India remains keen to invest in a stable relationship with #Russia. The India-Russia engagement of today is responding to today’s geopolitical imperatives, not of the past: Harsh V Pant. 
@truthjustice61 You're take is absurd. 30,000 #Russian troops dispatched to #Belarus, 100,000 to the #Russia/#Ukraine border - and YOU blame the #USA?
