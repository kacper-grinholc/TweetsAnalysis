Moscow moods: #Russia #Ukraine  “Parts of the business elite are preparing for the worst. Its leaders were once among the biggest #Putin supporters but have been sidelined over the years”.  
@SecBlinken @YusufDFI Just sanctioning #Russia is not going to work. Sanction #China n it’s financial institutions. Than only thing are going to work. Or else, it’s useless exercise.
I served during the Cold War &amp; remember my CO saying about #Russia: "It ain't over". He warned while we would become focused on other "more immediate" issues, Russia would continue doing its thing behind the scenes, and then suddenly, one day, it'd be October '62 all over again.

1. This video shows a weak attempt to stop Putin. This is my personal impression. 2. I'm alarmed by Naryshkin's phrase that he supports the entry of the occupied Donbas into Russia. Is this a slip of the tongue or one of Putin's next step? #Russia #Ukraine

I am predicting global leaders &amp; their representatives make embarassing F-ups very soon in regards to #Russia #Ukraine. There have been some (Truss) and there will be more to come.
Damn.  When ever the #UN Secretary General--which by necessity has to be as uncontroversial as possible--calls bullshit, you know you're not fooling anyone.  It's great to see that no one outside of #Russia is falling for this nonsense as they invade #Ukraine.

#Kenya's ambassador responds to #Russia's threats to invade #Ukraine &amp; #VladimirPutin's false history with an important statement to the UN Security Council about empire, #nationalism, irredentism, dangerous nostalgia &amp; the pursuit of ethnic homogeneity:   
“#Russia said it will soon evacuate its diplomatic staff from #Ukraine to “protect their lives”, hours after #Russian lawmakers approved #Russian President, Vladimir #Putin’s request to use military force abroad, the Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday.” 
.@SaraMeger on who the separatists being used as pawns in #Russia’s military posturing is well wroth a read: “People in western #Ukraine saw European integration as a panacea to [the] political problem, whereas people in the east were less optimistic.” 
I’m having a déjà vu today, I can't stop thinking about #17September1939 - always the same lies from #Russia: "liberating" or "sending peacekeepers", #passportization, "protecting Russian citizens", bending the facts to their own imaginary reality... How much longer?!?
