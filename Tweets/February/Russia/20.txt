#Ukraine #Russia. Second conversation of the day between President Macron and President Putin this evening. Intense diplomatic drive.

#Russia/#Ukraine/Post Biden Bows to #Putin  Hands Ukraine to #Putin on a Platter Gives Green Light -No NATO now -No "internal intervention" (Knowing Ukraine is unable to resist #Russia regime military might) -No consideration for human/etc loss (as in #Afghanistan)
Nearly five hours ago, #Russia shelled one of the "capital" cities in the occupied "separatist republics" in eastern #Ukraine, intending to blame the Ukrainian government.
“#European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen disclosed some details of the sanctions #Moscow would face if it invaded #Ukraine, saying #Russia would be cut off from international financial markets and denied access to major export goods.” 
#Putin and #Macron had a second telephone conversation in the last 24 hours - BFMTV  According to the channel, the call took place around 1:00 GMT+3 on February 21.  #Russia #France #Ukraine #RussiaUcraina #UkraineRussiaCrisis
One of the biggest indictors from this is #Russia's integration of ADA assets with movement and maneuver as well as fires assets within close range of the border with #Ukraine, units now appear to be organized and prepared to conduct action.
