@jakluge Exactly! 🇷🇺-🇺🇦crisis or #Russia-NATO antagonism are only part of global crisis in which those once we called “rogue” super powers are trying to dominate the world by monetary-military-hybrid power-politics, demolishing the post-WW2 liberal-democratic order

@TomBalawejder @McFaul @NATO We both know who is the tool here, and is you by far. Nuances of geopolitics are something that is way above your intellectual capacity, go cry to your mom that #Russia will invade #Ukraine. No invasion is gonna happen, unless @NATO truly wants a breakdown in Euro Security.
Most #Europeans want to stand with #Kyiv against #Moscow. More than 60% of people surveyed believe #NATO (#OTAN) should come to #Ukraine’s defence if #Russia invades. #UkraineCrisis #UkraineConflict #UkraineWillResist #UkraineInvasion #VladimirPutin 
Dangerous fucking idiot @BorisJohnson is actually trying to goad #NATO and #Russia  into war over the #UkraineCrisis. The demented clown thinks a war will distract the British people from his own homemade shit-storm of failure, corruption and incompetence.
“Majorities across #Europe think #Russia will invade #Ukraine in 2022 &amp; believe both #NATO &amp; the #EU should stand by #Kyiv, according to a study whose authors suggest the crisis could end up dramatically changing the way #Europeans view their security.” 
Thanks #Russia #Bitcoin

Analysts claiming that France is being soft on Russia are either trying to stoke more tension or don't understand the classic good cop (France) bad cop (USA) routine. NATO, an obstacle to peace, is unified but the leaders of its member states have differing roles. #Russia #NATO

@shashj This is a very helpful confirmation as to what Moscow really does not want. It is afraid that designating #Russia a hostile power in @NATO's new Strategic Concept (I have been long arguing for precisely that!) would undermine its key aim, i.e. reducing US defence role in Europe.

So in year one of his presidency @POTUS Biden surrendered to the Taliban. In year two he’s surrendering to drug #Cartels. It’s only a matter of time before he bends the knee to #Russia and #China.
