#oilprice #2022BuBBle They hope for 125,  promise 150, &amp; talk about years.  If I were the president of #Ukraine, I would hand over the country to #Russia &amp; save the world.  But what if nothing happened in Ukraine‚ùî‚ùó What will they say about all this delusion at prices‚ùì‚ùï 
U.S. #allies are negotiating for #peace and preparing for possible #war ‚Äì while #NATO forces hoping to encourage #Russia not to invade #Ukraine are holding a series of ‚Äú#wargames‚Äù in nearby #Estonia.

"The magnitude in the scope of #Russia‚Äôs challenge and threat. Is it commensurate with that of #China? Is it something entirely different? How do you think this plays into the whole aim of the US to not be as invested in European theatre and look toward the Pacific?" @GoranaGrgic 
#Macron does not seem to abide by his previous words on letting #Russia know of the developments between #Paris and #Kyiv, yet.
Liz Truss in Moscow to start the war then?! #Russia #LizTruss #newsnight
For the second day in a row, war hawks in the U.S. and NATO Wednesday had to contend with increased efforts by several European leaders to cool the crisis over Ukraine. #UkraineCrisis #Ukraine #Donbass #Russia  
@RealCynicalFox Exactly, and the fact that they get a total 49% from #Russia makes it far more dire than #NATO and other members are saying. #France gets 24% of their overall from Russia as well.
@usosce Lol, wut?!  #UnitedStates #wars #Hypocricy #Exceptionalism #Russia #Ukraine 
This is standard operating procedure. When the rhetoric of "democracy promotion" and "territorial integrity" does not align with reality, then of course they cannot allow media access. Only images of #Russia's invasion forces can make the headlines, not #NATO's! #UkraineCrisis

#Russia and #Belarus will begin 10 days of joint military drills , setting in train one of the most overtly threatening elements of the #Kremlin‚Äôs buildup of forces around #Ukraine‚Äôs borders.   
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives in #Melbourne  Despite mounting tensions between #Russia and #Ukraine, Can America prove it can focus on multiple issues at once? @brittanycoles8 #China #Politics 
So in year one of his presidency @POTUS Biden surrendered to the Taliban. In year two he‚Äôs surrendering to drug #Cartels. It‚Äôs only a matter of time before he bends the knee to #Russia and #China. 
While the #West is into its unrealistic to I am afraid moronic #EnergyTransition extravaganza, #Russia is tapping the natural resources of the #Arctic. As per @SamoBurja's analysis, it will ultimately lead to greater integration with #China. | @vtchakarova
