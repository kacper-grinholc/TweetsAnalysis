The latest on the #Ukraine-#Russia border crisis
I can blame #Putin for many things, but definitely not on foreign policy. #Russia has interest that have 5o be taken into concern, no matter what the others think and @NATO is perpetually against #Russia and needs to be stopped.
So if you are an @Olympics athlete, do not smoke weed before competing, but if you want to cheat, take #HeartMed to make heart work better, and you can compete. Too bad #Russia could give a crap about the other two #ROCSkaters who will not get metals.
üìù For the record:  üá©üá™ On Tuesday, Putin will meet the Chancellor of #Germany Olaf Scholtz.  üáßüá∑ On Wednesday, Putin will meet the President of #Brazil Jair Bolsonaro.  üìçlocation of meetings: #Russia  #US #Ukraine #Poland 
Ukraine has called on Russia to show more "transparency" regarding possible military plans. Kyiv says Moscow has so far ignored formal requests to explain its build up of troops near its borders, and this would be the "next step." (KI) #Ukraine #Russia #Transparency #Military
Warmer relations between #Germany &amp; #Russia signal an end to the unipolar world order the #US has overseen for the last 75 years. A German-Russo #alliance threatens to hasten the decline of the Superpower presently inching closer to the abyss. #NordStream2 
Highly interesting that FM #Lavrov seems to argue for a continued dialogue üá∑üá∫üá∫üá∏üá™üá∫ in order to see if there is some common ground, but that it‚Äôs said that #Putin hasn‚Äôt made his decision on the recommendation yet: @carlbildt #Ukraine #Russia #EU #US #RussiaUkraine #UkraineCrisis 
@Margin4Error And yet #EU imports more than 40% of it's gas from #Russia. If #Russia is in such a decline, how have they been able to amass a $630 billion reserves. If it's of no consequence, why did #US ask for #Russia help in #Iran deal. It's foolish to think that.
@DisclosureTv_ #Russia has issued orders for its citizens to leave Ukraine immediately... Russian citizen's aren't soldiers or in any form working for the government, you don't order them to do anything. Second, it's not true. Putin said no such thing...
The Russian parliament is pushing for independence for Lugansk and Donetsk republics from Ukraine -   #Russia #UkraineKonflikt #UkraineInvasion

Most likely pretext for #Russia to do #UkranianInvasion is a #falseflag in Eastern Ukraine whereby Russian FSB or similar attack Russian citizens &amp; blame it on Ukrainians. Vladimir Chizhov &amp; Russian media have been promoting #counterattack justifications all week. #breakingnews
And not even that war with #Ukraine will cost #Russia more then all of the military equitment, what has been transported in recent 3 months combined.

It could be that #Russia is hoping to create a situation of extremes (high demands, invasion, actions by the West) with the hopes of being able to, at the last moment, produce a middle/moderate option (AKA the result they want). Not sure what that would be.

Russia to attack Ukraine as artillery Regiment are positioning them self in strategic places along the border.  #Russia #RussiaInvadedUkraine #RussiaUkraine #Ukraine #UkraineCrisis #NATO #USA #russia_ukraine 
End Result: European security architecture is gone, any new one will take #Russia as an equal partner. Sanctions does impact #Russia, but in longer run trade off, #Russia will have a better trade off. #US influence declines massively having lost the deterrent effect. (9/n)
@RogerPielkeJr Seeing this you understand what a problem it would be for #Russia to occupy such a large land area where most of the populace would be hostile.
@RichardTCasey @Theimmigrant84 @LynAldenContact 4)Yes, it does cost growth and harms real incomes in #Russia but the alternative to that "financial fortress" strategy is to get blackmailed all the time on all sorts of issues.  5) #Ukraine is as far away from being a democracy as they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago.

If #Russia turns to negotiations now, it could stand to gain something. If it invades #Ukraine, it seemingly has nothing to gain except a war that no one wins and crippling sanctions, along with the threat of sparking more widespread conflict.

@FoxNews peddling Russia invasion of Ukraine propaganda &amp; warmongering.  #FoxNews is serving its Boomer audience, who believe the programming &amp; want war, per recent polling.  #RussiaUkraine #UkraineInvasion #Russia   Meanwhile, the real invasion continues via the southern border.
#Russia invading #Ukraine. What you get when you let a petty-minded, mini (dick) tyrant, wanna-be (actual) dictator rule a country for 2 too many decades.  #Putin
For real though, don‚Äôt poke the bear. #UkraineInvasion #Ukraine #ukrainerussia #BREAKING #RussiaUkraine #Russia #Biden #UkraineKonflikt

This is all about Putin hanging onto power If he does not it's game over for him Wouldn't surprise me if he resorted to becoming Tsar #Putin #MafiaState #Russia

@JoeBiden ratings in free fall in any case, @HouseDemocrats lose control of House, making his job even harder and relegating him to a one time presidency. The status quo remains, sanctions by west and #Russia consolidates #Ukraine.  #EU starts breaking consensus with time (6/n)

@jesseKawell @PolymathBull @ArsenyOlivari @PMGrabowski @BulgarOZ @amoslim @McFaul Yes, but one crucial difference is that #Russia actually NEEDS #Ukraine as buffer and needs it a lot more as  economic partner than the West which actually doesn't need UA at all. West is satisfied to divide RU/UA and will help UA just enough to keep an anti-RU regime in power.
#Ukraine #UkraineInvasion @KremlinRussia_E @Russia #Europe #dangerous  All in all, I do not really care all that much what #Russia does as long as that quixotic country does not want to attack #America. After all, who can stop Russia, from doing what it damn well pleases, anyway? 
The list of Democrat crimes is long:  - Accepting bribes from China, Russia, etc. - Rigging a US election - Impeachment with false evidence - Hiding COVID cures (HCQ, IVM) to help vaccine maker's profits - etc.  #HillaryClinton #Hillary #Biden #Trump #COVID19 #Russia #COVID #Jobs 
@peacefromashes @joeabodnar @KateKizer In this month‚Äôs @thebabesbluf, @blondenukegirl provided some essential context to #Ukraine's quest for #NATO membership and why #Russia is not happy about it: 
@MID_RF @RussiaInUSA @USEmbRu @USinStPete @USApoRusski @natomission_ru @NATO @NATOpress @RusMission_EU @EUinRussia Here's a couple of legitimate question.  Why did #Russia INVADE #Ukraine, years ago? Why are there #Putin's little green men all over #Crimea and #Donbas?
#UN Secretary-General #AntonioGuterres has called for diplomacy to defuse the heightened tensions between #Russia and #Ukraine.  Guterres has said that he is deeply worried about the current tensions and increased speculation about a potential military #conflict. 
@mccaffreyr3 War is avoidable if #NATO's eastward expansion is halted.  US has meddled with #Belarus and #Ukraine for years (remember #Trump's $400M blackmail?).  Belarus &amp; Ukraine are large buffer states bordering #Russia  and should not be part of a US-driven expansionist mil. alliance. 
I am constantly checking and praying over #UkraineInvasion by #Russia.  It‚Äôs likely to impact the market.  The intel is for Wednesday @OptionsPastor.  It‚Äôs hard for me to believe this is happening with #UN and #NATO still in operation.  Prayers and Sanctions are the only remedy.

Follow @EvangelistMDyal as I preach from the #PENTAGON as the world discusses the possibility of #worldwar3 ! #Putin #Russia #China May plot to take #Ukraine but what is God thinking and planning? It‚Äôs called #Armageddon and it will be in #Israel. Only #pentecost can #SaveAmerica 
@timkaine Your refusal to back the #AUMF President @BarackObama needed to militarily respond to Syrian use of chemical weapons is the key MOST foreign policy experts say emboldened #Putin, leading to the coming #UkraineInvasion  Should be called TIM(ID) KAINE  #Ukraine #Russia
Interesting question asked by a Greek journalist. Will the West head to a Potsdam or Yalta like conference/agreement with Russia? #Russia #Ukraine #US
#Ukraine should be #heightened every day to #ProtectUkraine. #Russia wants to invade with or without #warning. As #Ukrainians, we should be #ready to bring #HealthyAggression to #WinTheWar. @ukraine_world @UA_EUMission @EUDelegationUA
