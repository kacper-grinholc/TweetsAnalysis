Could #Russia and #US still find some sort of "pragmatic engagement?" @IFRI_ argues that reaching a stable relationship maybe impossible but dialogue can still be achieved to avoid a military conflict.
@benandjerrys has spoken out regarding US-Ukraine policy as tensions continue to grow in the region.  #Ukraine | #Russia | #Conflict   by @sfrantzman  
🇺🇸Russia could invade Ukraine “as soon as tomorrow,” Biden's National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan claims. #Ukraine #Russia 
Rallies had taken place Saturday under the motto "Peace with #Russia Day of Action: February 5, 2022," all across the #US. 
#Russia reports a record daily count of new #COVID19 infections of 180,071, a tenfold spike from a month ago as the highly contagious #omicron variant spreads through the country.
I pray the Ukrainian People  realise they're about to be used as Pions on the board by the military industrial complex. #Ukraine #Russia
Any Russian victory in the Ukrainian file, it will mean an accelerated expansion of Russian influence globally and may include even current #NATO allies who would prefer a less demanding in terms of democracy #Russia, especially in North Africa and the Middle East. 9/10
Nothing new in readout of Biden/Macron call but this is yet another sign #Macron wants to show #Putin that there is “constant concertation among allies” ahead of their meeting in Moscow on Monday. He’s also had calls w/ #NATO sec gen &amp; UK PM in recent days. #ukraine #russia #f24 
Look like #Russia has some strong views regarding #CryptoTax 😥📣👀 what are your thoughts on this? 🤔    #OdinPlatform #forex  #forextrading  #forextrader  #DeFi #OdinPlatformNews 
@anders_aslund 2&gt;&gt; Many Russians feel humilated by the West. So I think some will support this attack. Some will just not oppose it. See #China. You think Chinese will rise up if China attacks Taiwan? And Taiwan was 'lost' decades longer ago then Ukraine. What do you think?  #Russia #Ukraine

@trussliz Liz- don’t go stirring up war with #Argentina as well  You backed off #Article16, you weren’t missed when you avoided a meeting in #Russia over Ukraine and you agreed a lousy deal with NZ and #Australia.   Stick to cheese and pork as it’s about the limit of your diplomatic Skills
U.S.-Led Air Bridge of #Weapons  Seeks to taunt #Russia. Troops fight wars, if #Russia wins then they will belong to #Putin  #Fail   
@a_appeliii I trust a GOP Senator who went to Russia during our July 4th week (so patriotic) to learn #RussianStylePROPAGANDA &amp; GOVERNING &amp; who said “poor people in #America live better than middle class in other countries” (#RUSSIA). When did we start comparing to other nations? No doubt
#Russia  At the outset, it must be emphasized that the Russian administration, which was built on the ruins of the Soviet Union, still sees #Ukraine in the same way, that this country is a natural part of the Russian Federation (in terms of race, language and geography). 2/16 
Here is my take on the Russian-Ukrainian crisis focusing on the fears and the benefits for both Moscow and Washington regarding this crisis. 1/16 #Russia #USA #Putin #Biden #NATO #UkraineCrisis #Ukraine 
Fourth book of the year proceeding nicely. Requiem for a Glass Heart by David Lindsey. Written back when Russia was reeling from the breakup of the Soviet Union and overrun by organised crime. #Russia #reading #spynovel 
During my work with @mdmgreece, I lived in Ukraine, in #Mariupol, for more than three years Ukraine has a unique place in my heart as a beautiful and great people and nation. #Russia #USA #Putin #Biden #NATO #UkraineCrisis #Ukraine 
@JackPosobiec Davai davai everyone! #Jack's bots and trolls! #Putin #Russia
#UPDATE: Iskander-M short range ballistic missile systems spotted in Bryansk #Russia. Range is 50 to 500km, around 60+ have been moved near Ukrainian borders or border areas. #Ukraine 
The world isn't ready for another war. #Ukraine #Russia
@CityAM Fooking late to this party, no? As if he just discovered this was an'issue' #MoneyLaundering #Kleptocracy #Russia #DirtyMoney #Oligarch #Statethreat #CORRUPTION
So @JakeSullivan46 claims on @TheWeek that #Russia could invade #Ukraine tomorrow. I guess they're going full gobsheen now. Why is it that the biggest gobdaws left and right in America are #Irish  #UkraineCrisis my arse
I’m simple Russian girl, I have vodka in my blood ( c ) it’s a joke) #Russia #culture #winter 
Provided that there won't be an extended war in eastern Ukraine (why should #Russia invade the #Donbass region at all? It does not make any sense). The question is: what will happen after #NATO and #US forces along with #Putin's squads will have left the ukrainian border area?
@Texaspaleo Taibbi is a complex case. His book about Eric Garner was a passionate masterpiece of justice #journalism. His skepticism of #Russia’s role in the 2016 election is almost certainly wrong. His skepticism about Covid censorship is worth reading. It’s complicated.
THREAD #Russia #Ukraine 
@mariasopot1 @georgethecutter @apmassaro3 It’s true. Russia has a long history of appropriating Ukrainian culture and history.  It’s like they are ashamed of their own so they just keep trying to rewrite it. #putin #russia #ukraine
