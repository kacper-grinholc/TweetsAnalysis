#Putin's choice of table for his meeting with #Macron vividly illustrates #Russia's theme of the moment: it wants its space.

@joncoopertweets #Trump is a #RussianAsset, and won’t stand up to #Russia. John Bolton reliably said that if Trump was #President, the #Russians would already be in Kiev.
It's obvious that #Putin is cracking under the pressure the oligarchy must be putting tremendous pressure on him. #Putin seriously misjudged #NATO will and resolve #Russia #NATO. These are the ravings of a leader who is boxed in. Attack or withdraw both bad choices for Putin.

Too much for me. Too many lies in this conference. Putin tell us it is white what we all see is black. And no, black is not the new orange. Black is black. Let's not fool ourselves about #Russia

Here’s my guess, hope I’m wrong @PattyArquette   This translator had a “terrible accident” befall them shortly after Helsinki.  He/she is unable to speak/in a coma/missing/has died.  #sorry #Russia 
All six @RoyalNavy Type 45 destroyers are currently docked in port, at a time of heightened tensions with #Russia. 
In presser w/ #Macron, #Putin again dismisses #NATO open-door policy as a "wide interpretation" of the alliances rules, insisting NATO "has no obligation" to accept a new member.  It's important to note that no one has ever said NATO had to take in #Ukraine. #Russia

#Russia may well fear that #Ukraine, backed by @NATO, will try to seize back #Crimea, which #Moscow could see as attack on #Russia. Just b/c we don't see it like this doesn't mean it's not at back of #Russian minds &amp; reason for troops near border.
