#Russia’s version of de-escalation is to keep adding to their list of demands. Now they want all western military trainers to leave and Ukraine to return all weapons. 
A host of other countries have also urged their nationals to leave #Ukraine.  They include the #UK, #Canada, the #Netherlands, #Latvia, #Japan and #SouthKorea.   #Russia's foreign ministry has accused Western countries of spreading false information.

Ukraine: What if we send this picture to Russian President Putin in Russia on Valentine's day? #Putin #Russia #Russian👇 #Ukraine 
❌ Interestingly enough, when I look back at 1939, the moves by politicians in #Europe, the statements being said: both hardline and appeasement comments, I can only say there are shocking parallels.  As if history must repeat itself ❌ ____________ #Ukraine #Kyiv #Russia #NATO
All the idiots are pushing for war. Americans can't corner Russia and expect no reaction, it's a very stupid move. #Usa #Russia #Ukraine
USA and Canada have borders blocked by citizens demanding their #freedom back. Many countries planning #freedomconvoys of their own to combat government tyranny. #Trudeau and #Biden: "Look out Russia is about to invade #Ukraine!" #Russia: "No we're not." 
#Russia could invade #Ukraine at any time and is amassing more #troops along the #border, U.S. Secretary of State #AntonyBlinken said Friday, a day after the State Department urged Americans to leave the country immediately.  
Ok, give the gold metal to #Russia womens figure skating IF they pull their troops back from #Ukraine !!!
@MartinE33275784 @RALee85 Martin,  You bring up a good point. I think #Kiev is waiting to do just that. That might trigger a Russian reaction... and so on.  Rob, @shustry,   Any news on this?  #Ukraine #Russia #UkraineCrisis
#BREAKING (via WH press pool) #Biden will have a conversation Saturday morning with #Russia's president, Vladimir #Putin, per WH stmt:  "Russia proposed a call Monday. The White House counter-proposed Saturday, and they accepted."  #Ukraine #Zelensky

#Finland seals deal for U.S. #F35 stealth jets, reflecting tight ties to NATO. This comes at a time when there is tension between #NATO and #Russia over #Ukraine  
The brave and beautiful people of Ukraine.  Are an inspiration to the entire world.  How not to buckle to a nasty bully neighbor who force their children to do drugs.  Ukraine would be a fine NATO Partner. #NATO #USA #RUSSIA #Europe  
I pity career professionals in the Foreign Office. They must be fizzing at Lizz Truss. #Russia #Ukraine 
There are no winners in war. Except if you’re long oil. But there will be no war. #Russia
Not forgetting this while Russian boots are on the grounds ready to invade Ukraine #Obama #Russia #Ukraine #Biden 
🇺🇦#Ukraine isn't showing alarm, as US indicates that a possibly imminent invasion by #Russia would likely begin with aerial bombings, and might include a "rapid assault" on Kyiv.  But Kyiv Mayor @Vitaliy_Klychko has outlined emergency preparations, if needed, reports @MarquardtA 
If Putin is flexing muscles as a negotiation tool, not succeeding this time. #Ukraine not accepting one-sided implementation of Minsk  and the West slammed the door on the Kremlin’s core demands. #Russia can’t maintain this buildup for long and dip. is faltering. That’s scary.
I've said it before in a past twatr life but I've never had any issue with President Putin. #Russia🇷🇺#Russia🇷🇺#Russia🇷🇺  I hope he sees this! 
Taking to @ChadHastyRadio at 705pm on #Russia and #Ukraine. What oh what will Putin do?

"a boycott of the [#ICM2022] will not help the release of Azat.. Russian authorities may even be pleased with another argument that helps them portray #Russia as a “besieged fortress.”  The Russian mathematical community will suffer a..loss. Does it deserve such a punishment[?]"  
#Russia #UkraineInvasion #Biden #Bidenflation  Is the Biden administration's claims that Russia's invasion of the Ukraine is "imminent" simply to distract us from his destruction of our economy?
#BREAKING US Nat'l Security Council issues readout of Nat'l Security Advisor #JakeSullivan's meeting today with #Sweden's state sec for foreign affairs to the prime minister, Karin Wallensteen, re: multiple topics, incl. #Russia and #Ukraine.  #Putin #Zelensky
