@BelindaJones68 It's not just you Bee. US should eff off and leave #Russia and #Ukraine alone. The #armsindustry requires an urgent stocktake sale. Too many outdated weapons sitting on the shelf, while they're pushing for newer models to get a test run.
#Russia doesn’t want war “but if there is a threat to the lives of citizens of the Russian Federation and compatriots living in the DPR and LPR, then Russia will stand up for them”, new statement spreading from RU media | EMPR #russiaukrainewar #RussiaCrisis #Ukraine
USA should change its presidential elections from 4 to every 8 years. This will reduce the number of wars by 50%. Because, every new president feels that launching a new war is their existential necessity and they all start with the creation of a monster. #Russia
It's a big worry when @POTUS, who has difficulty remembering names, seems convinced #Russia is hell bent on attacking the Ukraine. Will the defence chiefs support him?
#Russia has started attacking the #DNR &amp; #LNR districts of #Ukraine in the much-anticipated #FalseFlag operations, in preparation for the ill-conceived invasion of a sovereign nation.
