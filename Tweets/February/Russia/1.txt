@RealScottRitter @2Stroong Scott, I think #Russia moved their navy drills further away from Irish economic zone as a sign to the world by saying -we listen &amp; respect those who talk to us, who treat us equally with with respect. It‚Äôs a message that  Russia will cooperate if the opponents choose to.
@Apex_WW If #Russia launches an invasion,there will be millions of emigrants! And I don't know how Europe will like it! The result is ... similar to a war.
Even if Russia invades Ukraine I suspect that #Singapore may continue to provide a haven for Russian investors and be a gateway into Asia. @Billbrowder  #Russia #Ukraine #Magnitsky

Lots of sound thinking concerning #Russia's relationship with the world from Gray &amp; Jon in this podcast.  Probably should be required listening for IR students and US policy wonks.  I have an analysis of this percolating in my mind, problem is writing &amp; distributing it. 
Putin today came out after a week tells everyone that he believes #Ukraine joins #NATO next they attack #Crimea what he considers Russian territory. This will provoke war between #Russia &amp; NATO he says. Can anyone confirm if Mr Capone is doing some hefty Crack cocaine? Seriously. 
Here's my message to #Putin and #Russia:  You may be waiting for #Trump to be president again and you may want to help him, but he's either going to be in prison or in a coffin.  You can visit him in Hell.
Can we please not go to war with #Russia? Life is complicated and hard enough when there isn't a fucking war going on.

The US understands that the last Fourth Turning was the unification of #Germany, not the 1st US civil war. Or we'd still be allies with #Russia and the "British" [German] monarchy would have faded into history instead of what we've seen since. #Berlin1932

Putin miscalculated, he hoped massing troops on #Ukraine would result in US assuring security for #Russia, similar to 1991 pledges.  But US has exploited situation to expand pressure on Russia and reinforce support from Ukraine and other countries. Only US gains from European war
@soniasodha on #skypapers speaks as though Putin wanting to invade #ukraine is a given, demonstrating complete ignorance of history  before 2014, when #Russia was living with assurances from the West in 1991 that NATO would not expand. NATO now threatans Russian border.

#Hungary who is one of the #NATO and #EU Member States maintains pragmatic and positive relations with #Russia. A good example to follow if we want peace, stability and security in Europe. 
@USAmbUN discusses the UN perspective of the rising #Ukraine and #Russia tensions. 
The #US can support #Ukraine by using its influence to encourage cooperation between its political and business elite. @KamranBokhari writes that without more cohesion, Ukraine can't withstand military and economic pressure from #Russia, in @ForeignPolicy.

Excellent analysis @lindseyhilsum @Channel4News re #Russia, #Ukraine. Points out how #Russia #Putin in spin over what they see as aggressive western intentions designed to trick them into war. Note: they can misread us as we misread them. Therein lies the danger #UkraineCrisis
John Kirby @PentagonPresSec on Tuesday warned Americans that Russian President Vladimir Putin is adding to Russian forces surrounding Ukraine and that he could move soon.  #JustTheNews #Ukraine #Russia 
America Isn‚Äôt Ready for Russia‚Äôs Battlefield Nuclear Weapons - #Russia 
@thinkdefence Do not underwestimate the power of #tyranny.  They do that in #Bielorussia now and even in their own country #russia
The world's eyes are turned on eastern Europe for a possible Russian invasion of #Ukraine. The conventional wisdom is that #Europeangovernments would sanction #Russia who would retaliate by cutting off their #gassupplies. The #Economist argues differently: 
@PixelatedBoot We can already make our own ammonium nitrate, looks like they are just trying to tank their own economy at this point. #UnitedStates and #Europe will find other suppliers, good luck to #Russia trying to get back their business by doing this.
Rolling Stone   ‚ÄúToday, when the Russian army is on our border threatening another invasion, Putin should understand that he has lost the most important people. He lost us, Russian speaking Ukrainians.‚Äù  #Putin #Ukraine #Russia   
How do you put sanctions on #Russia #Putin when they get everything from #China?  #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
#Russia trying to steer #Hungary to the east with their pawn they have in place 
@Nigel_Farage is switched on as usual. Saying exactly what I've been saying for days. An independent üá∫üá¶#Ukraine outside of #NATO &amp; üá∑üá∫#Russia both secures peace in Europe &amp; üá∫üá¶Ukraine's permanent independence. The buffer state situation works, let's keep it. üëçüèª #GBNews @GBNEWS 
#Ukraine is surrounded by military drills. 1. #Belarus to North,  2. #Moldova to West, 3. #Crimea to South,  4. #Russia build up in East..  #Russian forces hold military drills in breakaway statelet near Ukraine 
In Washington, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, reacted derisively to Mr. Putin‚Äôs comments, comparing them to ‚Äúwhen the fox is screaming from the top of the henhouse that he‚Äôs scared of the chickens.‚Äù via @nytimes  #priceless #russia #USA
02/01/22 #Russia #Ukraine @DOD @thejointstaff @SecDef @US_EUCOM @US_Stratcom @NATO @ODNIgov @WHNSC @SecBlinken: Putin's remark on Tuesday reflected his view that Russia needed to defend itself from an aggressive US. He said Washington doesn't have Ukraine's best interests...(1/6)
If nations other than #Ukraine  and #Russia have better perceptions about what is happening between these two nations why can't they put their brains to diffuse crisis instead of choosing the easy job of military options ? #Security #UK #USA @UN #InternationalRelationships 
After more than a month, Gazprom was set to resume westbound gas flows from Poland to Germany on Tuesday via the Yamal pipeline, after the reversal sent gas prices in Europe to all-time highs. #YamalPipeline #NaturalGas #Russia #Europe
We are in a crisis in the UK ,cost living  "ect",but this #PM , will  give millions in aid to the #UKRAINE over tenions with #RUSSIA ; WE are being DRAWN into a CONFLICT ; right or wrong ;;
#Taliban and #ISIS are proxies of the western governments, a weapon against #Russia and #China. 
Then what's imposed on #Iran, the "father"? Time to start a happy sanctioned family...  America prepares the ‚Äúmother of all sanctions‚Äù against #Russia @TheEconomist 
Keep in mind #Russia is among the worlds largest producers of ammonium nitrate. This is going to but critical amounts of strain on that market. #Ukraine #Crimea #Donbas #NATO #EU #Europe #ukrainerussia 
It's indeed bizarre that so-called "capitalist" bastions across the globe are being sucked into #Fascism. ALL that matters to the rich anymore IS their money. They're ALL-IN with corruption, and NO nation is more corrupt than #Putin's #Russia! @GOP is a #RussianAsset! 
‚ÄúIt is already clear that Russia‚Äôs fundamental concerns have been ignored,‚Äù Putin said.  President Putin delivered his first remarks on #Russia's standoff with the West over #Ukraine by claiming the US and @NATO have ignored #Moscow‚Äôs top security demands. 
.@mmagierowski: "The US has made it clear that strengthening #NATO's eastern flank is necessary to deter #Russia and the only way to prevent them from acting unreasonably".
When you're thinking about the #Ukraine  &amp; reading histories of WW2 &amp; how the Germans nearly got to Moscow, think about how Napoleon actually took Moscow &amp; still got his ass kicked by the #Russians. There is no winning a war w/ #Russia. Just doesn't happen. The Russians know this

#Russia Refutes Biden Admin Statements That Russia Responded to U.S. #Ukraine Proposal: by Sebastian Hughes -    Russian officials denied they sent a response to a U.S. proposal aiming to deescalate the conflict at the Ukrainian border just one day after‚Ä¶  
@rteliveline Quick someone tell Joe #British &amp; #US Navy dropping Active Sonar Bouy's all over Irelands EEZ, causing catastrophic damage to sea life. #UK &amp; #US are actually doing what Joe spent a week accusing #Russia of doing. Lets see the balance eh!  @BowesChay 
US aims at hampering Russia‚Äôs growth not ensuring Ukrainian security - Putin  US is not so much concerned about the Ukrainian security, although maybe it thinks about this, but its main task is to hamper #Russia‚Äôs development #USA #Ukraine #Donbass #Crimea
Interesting history lesson about #Russia and #Yeltsin, #Gorbatchov and #Putin 
What is happening between #America and #Russia now is not reassuring
Noted author &amp; #Russia scholar, @RadioFreeTom, weighs in on eroding civic values in the US today and a 40-year old political ad about the Russian "bear in the woods" ‚Äî just as the bear now threatens #Ukraine. Listen now:  
The evidence is on their side I'm afraid.  Honestly you would be better off justifying why #Russia gets involved with the rest of the former #USSR rather than completely deny it. 
Yes! I knew Horowitz wasn't fully utilizing Transparency,  and thus avoiding Accountability! #SteeleDossier #Russia #Clinton  "Durham Filing Rebuts Inspector General Horowitz‚Äôs Claims on Missing Cellphones, Hints at Growing Rift" 
If you care more about partygate than the Ukraine Russia situation‚Ä¶you are truly stupid. And yes this includes the BBC‚Ä¶why are we still paying you‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt like you.  #PartyGate #Russia #Ukraine #BBC
