US intelligence-sharing convinces allies of Russian threat to Ukraine via @FT #ukraine #russia 
#worldnewstonight on #ABC network. It was a piece how supposedly #Russia is ready to invade #Ukraine &amp; about #Biden/#Putin #virtual #meeting. In that piece, ABC news failed to mention Russian troops are 250 miles away from Ukraine. Also ABC used Victory Day military parade photos

@anders_aslund #Russia will never invade #Ukraine again.

@AFP Comment:1206221 Putin's intend YoY is a  revival o the Soviet Union;  it's military might, territorial control no longer hindered. #Ukraine's independence case is the same as 1939 Poland's casus belli. Both aren't about the present reality b abt Putin's will t turn the clock back
'nr' Voronezh is where they supposedly were in April, 200+km from #Ukraine. Btw, where would you expect #Russia to station its troops in normal times, w/ @NATO countries on its Western borders? Siberia?

What is The Biden Administration prepared to do about this pending situation?  #Ukraine 
@mdubowitz Russia is threatening #Ukraine/U.S., China is threatening #Taiwan/U.S., Iran is threatening #Israel/U.S.. What will the U.S. do to defend these countries?  What will the U.S. do to arm these countries with the weapons they need?#StandWithUkraine #StandWithTaiwan #StandWithIsrael

I've always found Putin's "one people" argument incoherent in an abusive husband kind of way: Ukrainians &amp; Russians are one people, have shared history, language &amp; culture. Therefore, #Russia will invade #Ukraine, kill more "brothers &amp; sisters", proving Russia really cares??🤔 
#Russia/ Yes #Russia is a threat for all of us (the Europeans), might be Polish, Romanian or French. No doubt here.  Yes, #Ukraine is at risk. Very high risk.  But please, do not forget Baltic States. #Latvia #Estonia and #Lithuania are at risk as well. We need coordination. Now. 
Not all Europeans live in peace.   #Russia is planning an offensive in #Ukraine by using 100 battalion tactical groups with an estimated number of up to 175,000 soldiers.  #Europe will be alongside Ukraine. Attacking Ukraine means attacking all of us, all Europeans. 🇺🇦🇪🇺

Front page of Monday 6 December @FT’ front page, with #Ukraine and the threat of military invasion by #Russia as the main story: 
@RT_com @RealScottRitter Apart From When You Stole Part Of: #Ukraine A Few Years Ago :/ :(
If Putin starts another offensive against Ukraine it would be his last big mistake. #Ukraine #Russia
"There are tactical reasons for threatening an invasion, but the real cause may lie in the Kremlin’s fixation with righting what it sees as a historical injustice."  Good read. #Ukraine, colonized by #Russia, has a better historical injustice argument IMHO
@madrid_mike Absent #Ukraine joining @NATO, which would require US Senate ratification (among other actions), America should not use military force.
A part of #Russia’s exploits in #Ukraine in the past years have revolved around classical Russian foreign policy goals; specifically securing the Western buffer (Ukraine/#Belarus) and deterring the expansion of NATO.  Only now is Putin being so direct.

We're beyond Stopping #NordStream2 already. No matter Putin's Apache tribe dance their sanctuary, if invading #Ukraine its a warcrime! Besides cutting them financially the West must close airspace &amp; maritime waters for all Russian traffic. &amp; kick Putin crime friends straight out! 
@McFaul Ukraine-haters .@amoshochstein +.@secblinken  are collaborating w/ germany to make sure that mass-murderer #putin's #nordstream2 pipeline succeeds, empowering #ENEMYruSSia to defeat #Ukraine. This is truly disgusting, &amp; severely weakens the US. 
I find it difficult to find reliable and unbiased takes on #Russia #Ukraine conflict, but this is a good explainer by @GresselGustav for anyone who wants to catch up on what’s happening there before this ratchets up a level in next few weeks #UkraineAlert 
U.S. intelligence shared with #Biden its estimate- #Putin plans to use 175,000 troops (half are already deployed) along #Ukraine's border, 100 battalions of tactical troops along with tanks and #artillery. #UkraineAlert #Military #defense #geopolitics
Yes - weapons, intel, training, defence funds etc.: what #Ukraine needs today and the best deterrent, and sending soldiers is somewhat unlikely. Multilateral framework would be the ideal channel, even if consensus may be tricky. Speed is essential, so clever coordination for now. 
#Russia #Ukraine If Russia invades Ukraine . China will invade Taiwan. This will tie the hand's of the United States and it's WOKE Generals .
NATO Russia founding act? I agree with @general_ben. Folks have an inalienable right to a normal, peaceful existence to raise seed.  #WarsawSummit #ukraine
#China in the last few weeks and since #Biden has taken over from #Trump has been quite intimidating and aggressive towards #Taiwan. Again, if #NATO and the #US goes to #Ukraine's rescue, it will encourage China to go after Taiwan. [2/2]
The west needs to think carefully how to respond in case #Russia invades #Ukraine. Why? Because if the US and Europe is busy trying to save Ukraine and push back the Russians, it will give China the green light to invade Taiwan. The west will be fighting a two-front war. [1/2]

@AnarchoTerran @andersostlund @TatAtfender @patrikoksanen 2015? nothing 2016? nothing 2017? nothing 2018? nothing 2019? nothing 2020? nothing 2021?  ..?  14000+ dead Ukrainian's. Occupied Donbas, Occupied Crimea. Most heavily mined and weaponized area's in the world.  Sure we will join NATO if Russia invades further into #Ukraine. 🤷‍♂️
@LeannConklin See #Ukraine today in news cycle days after Liz Cheney announces weeks of public hearings in January  So much overlap w tax grifters &amp; insurrection players subpoenaed to speak, see no way contradictions between each’s story don’t pile up fast  imagine most be advised and take 5th

@andersostlund @TatAtfender @patrikoksanen Why didn't Crimea and Donbas trigger anyone in joining in 2014?  Slowest reaction without even having a reaction. Like they are testing Russia to invade #Ukraine further.  Everything is so telegraphed it's unbelievable.  Lets tell our enemy how we are going to defend ourselves 🙃
Authorities in #Russia and #Ukraine have closed down a number of illegal #crypto mining facilities allegedly powered by stolen electricity. 
Chairperson of the 🇺🇦 Parliament @r_stefanchuk also took part in the ceremony of laying lighted lamps at the Monument to victims of the Holodomor in #Ukraine in 1932-1933 in the Wolski Orthodox Cemetery in #Warsaw. 
Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada of #Ukraine @r_stefanchuk began his working visit to the Republic of #Poland by honoring the memory of the soldiers of the Ukrainian People’s Republic Army who are buried in the Wolski Orthodox Cemetery in #Warsaw.

@McFaul @Swiftpfote 1 It's NOT "right" to negotiate with terrorist &amp; mass-murderer #putin.  2 There are SO MANY ways to stop #ENEMYruSSia, but pro-kremlin WH advisors pretend not to know this. 3 #Ukraine is a great  democratic country &amp; US ally. 4 #ruSSia is our enemy.
What #Russia’s Military Movements Could Mean for #Ukraine, #Europe, and #NATO  via @ViewsWeek @mfa_russia @InModernRussia @Ukraine @EU_Commission @NATO
Just arrived in #Warsaw for the 11th Parliamentary Assembly of the Lublin Triangle. The main topics to discuss with colleagues from #Poland and #Ukraine - Russian troop buildup at the Ukrainian border and Lukashenka’s hybrid attack. 
@KremlinRussia_E I’mma need my shit back.. Let me get that!!  #CRIMEA #INHERITANCE #UKRAINE #HOMIES
There are currently rumors about skirmishes at the Ukrainian border.   #Russia #Ukraine
@TomCollina @McFaul I believe the position of @stephenkinzer whereby #Ukraine becomes a #neutral state is sounder than adding fuel to the fire in the form of sending more American #weapons. #MIC #NATO
#Russia along with #China, #DPRK, #Pakistan, #Turkey, #Syria, and others should form a military alliance to counter #NATO. Russia’s ‘plan to invade #Ukraine’ exists only in the #US and NATO imagination 
How the west disarmed #Ukraine from its nuclear arsenal and left it defenceless against #Russia #budapestmemorandum

What exactly did the first meeting between Biden &amp; Putin achieve? — The “strategic stability” Washington sought remained an elusive concept. And here we are five months later w/meeting No.2 scheduled for Tuesday as #Russia amasses troops on #Ukraine border
