Nothing can be ruled out in such scenarios but I see it as:-  #Putin won't attack #Ukraine to give #China an edge.  #USA won't engage militarily with #Russian to lose its focus on 🇨🇳,  However, 🇨🇳 would like both 🇷🇺&amp;🇺🇸 to engaged militarily.

 Putin is now realizing that POTUS is nothing like what 🤡 (t)rump told him he is. #Ukraine
The White House releases a readout of the Biden-Putin call. @PressSec says President Biden "urged Russia to de-escalate tensions with Ukraine. He made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if #Russia further invades #Ukraine." 
“The top #US military commander in #Europe wants to reinforce #NATO’s eastern flank with multinational battlegroups in #Romania and #Bulgaria because of concerns about #Russia’s moves around #Ukraine.” 
#Ukraine’s geographical proximity with both the #EU and #Russia enables it to extend its cooperation across both sides, especially owing to deep historical and cultural ties with Russia, points out Rahul Kamath. 
Some progress has been made in the call it seems #Ukraine #russia #USA. Call between Putin and Biden ended recently and lasted for about an hour. Some details are starting to emerge now.
