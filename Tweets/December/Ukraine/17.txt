Military invasion by Russia Ukraine is certainly unstoppable?: but #Moscow lists demands for defusing #Ukraine tensions: massive borders share between Ukraine’s, the #EU and Russia, with which it has deep social and cultural ties.  
@TotalTobi @GlasnostGone All the more reason to show international support for #Ukraine. Thank you for your service and sacrifice, Tobias. Thank you for sharing part of your experience.
Scenario 4: Show of force in Rumsfeldian "shock and awe" style. Occupation of entire #Ukraine and negotiations to reach a grand bargain.  Very high cost to maintain, high escalation risk, but militarily feasible. Allows #Moscow to chose which parts of Ukraine to keep in control.
Scenario 3: #Russia goes for a "decapitation strike" seizing #Kiev.   Forcing #Ukraine in unilateral surrender is pointless since after withdrawal #NATO moves in.  Effective control of Kiev solidifies #Putin as a restorer of #Russian greatness but technically difficult.
Scenario 2: #Russia assumes control of #Novorossiya which roughly corresponds to #Donetsk oblast+most of Southern #Ukraine up to #Odessa.  Ukraine's geopolitical value is significantly reduced, losses access to #BlackSea, link to #Transnistria achieved.
How will an intervention (read:war) between #Russia and #Ukraine play out.   Assuming #Moscow instigates hostilities in response to  #Kiev's #NATO aspirations which Russia views as an existential danger, let's examine available scenarios ranging in escalation/consequences.
#Putin doesn’t know what to do because I keep revealing his plans, forcing him to change them, @JakeSullivan46   Right now, @KremlinRussia_E is looking at invading #Ukraine on February 21, the day after @Beijing2022 wraps up. @ZelenskyyUa 
#Ukraine #NATO ...and what we can trust in: 
Russia issues list of demands it says must be met to lower tensions in Europe. Contentious security guarantees Moscow is seeking include a ban on #Ukraine from entering Nato 
@HueyFirst @SWYGAntiMPrty Opposite. #Russia is looking like #Iraq. When Iraq's Saddam wanted to invaded #Kuwait, West warned for consequences. Now Russia's Putin wanting to invade #Ukraine, west warning them too. Only the strategy will be different and result will be same.

#Ukraine has become the main flashpoint in #Russia's relations with the West after a build-up of tens of thousands of Russian troops near its border and a series of tough statements from President Vladimir #Putin setting out his "red lines".  READ MORE:

This supports one of the points we stated in our recent piece: Putin's Ukraine policy is motivated by fear for for own life:  #geopolitics #putin #russia #NATO #Ukraine #Crimea #Donbass

@nikola_sock It’s the British tabloids. It’s not reporting. It’s entertainment. Like a war movie. And aimed specifically &amp; only at British working class. It’s not about informing anyone of anything.   That’s the point the #Ukraine war hype has reached

#Russia #Ukraine: Moscow lists demands for defusing Ukraine tensions - Putin is like Hitler at the Munich conference. The British &amp; French who were too frightened to fight in 1938 where forced to fight, on Hitler’s terms, in 1939  
It's becoming clear that #Russia will attack #Ukraine. It might be limited or a wider conflict, but I find it hard to believe that this situation will get better before it gets worse

The weak #UK are promising to stand behind #Ukraine against the giant #Russia ?! Someone care to explain do #UK has strategy to stop SU-35 of flaying over #Ukraine ?  @UKinEgypt @UKParliament @10DowningStreet careful what you wish it’s not #Hollywood movies 😂 
@dwnews embarassing mistake from You! 🤦‍♀️  #planehijacker-#Lukaschenko tried to force #MariaKolesnikova into exile, but couldn't force her to #Ukraine as she shread her passport.  Then Lukaschenko prisoned her in #BELARUS!!!!!!!!  #DWnews #false #information please correct asap.  
@AliRogin #Russia does not respect weak, mincing diplomatic speak. "We're going to put on the table our concern" is a surefire way to draw #Russian disdain and hostility. It's the language of the spineless, woke Western Millennial. Do these fools have no cultural insight?  #Ukraine
MFA spox #Zakharova: #NATO is sending more weapons to #Ukraine and training its military personnel. This is done not for the ostensible purpose of maintaining stability and security but to scale up the ongoing civil war in the country.

There is serious discussion that West and #Russia could have regarding legitimate/legitimate security concerns on both sides about European security. But can't be US-Russia over heads of Europeans and #Ukraine. And will require more serious approach from Kremlin. 3/3
Kremlin handling of these drafts will raise concern in West that #Russia is not serious about negotiating but is laying pretext for attacking #Ukraine.  US, #NATO and #EU should be doing all they can now to make clear the painful costs that would be imposed if Russia attacks. 2/3
Moscow's draft #NATO-#Russia and #US-Russia agreements are full of demands that Kremlin must know will be unacceptable to West and take no account of Western or #Ukraine's concerns.  Making draft agreements public does not suggest they provide basis for serious negotiations. 1/3
