#Ukraine Military action is unthinkable for Russia, because it means a full-scale war with the West. Moreover, doing so will only benefit China, which Putin cannot possibly not know. Russia's troops is nothing more than to show its power and threaten Ukraine not to join NATO.

@MarQs__ @idreesali114 Finally, a decent and strong leader. Biden and the jello-spine Zelensky could learn from him.   #Ukraine
NATO's Stoltenberg rejected Russian demands to rescind a 2008 commitment to #Ukraine that the country would one day become a #NATO member via @idreesali114
Yup, Empire is pulling back   #US Officials Tell Ukraine No #NATO Membership For At Least A Decade  #Ukraine ending like any other US proxy: used and then betrayed... 
NEW: "There is still is a sizable amount of #Russia|n forces" along border w/#Ukraine, "per @PentagonPresSec   "We have continued to see increases [in Russian troops] over recent days &amp; weeks" he adds
NEW: "@NATO membership is a NATO decision to make" per @PentagonPresSec, asked about #Russia|n demands #Ukraine, #Georgia not be granted membership  "It's for NATO allies to determine...sovereign nations decide that"
In this week's @CSPC_DC Friday News Analysis, I take a look at the Biden-Putin call and the latest developments in the #Russia-#Ukraine situation. 
Biden invited #Ukraine to #NATO, this is big news, conflict is about to begin.  #Russia is doing #LiveFire artillery drills in the #SeaOfAzov amd has blocked off Ukraines access.   #RepublicanSenators have threatened #NuclearStikes on Russia #WWIII 
It is reported that the BMP of the Armed Forces of #Ukraine somewhere in the southern direction, after the shelling of the #DPR, left the firing position so hastily that it ran into a #Ukrainian mine. One crew member jumped out and ran away, the fate of the rest is unknown. 
I hope I'm wrong about this, but every day it's looking more and more likely that my birth country is going to be the catalyst that ignites #WWIII. Why can't Putin leave my people alone? Fuck that guy. #UkraineWillResist #Ukraine #RussoUkrainianConflict
You see? A proof that Russians want war is that they have put their country very near #NATO bases. (Not updated in the map #Sweden &amp; the #Baltic countries even closer around #Russia, recently announcing intentions of also sending troops to #Ukraine) 
Here is just some of the travel photography I have done. I hope you enjoy it!  #America #Mauritius #Ukraine #photography #travelphotography 
Ukraine's Jewish president loses hope in the West and ‘does not rule out’ the Donbass referendum. #Donbass #Ukraine
#Russia demands #Nato retract pledge to admit #Ukraine and #Georgia that offer the most detailed insight so far into the “red lines” #VladimirPutin wants to form the basis of a new European security order   #JoeBiden #Stoltenberg #vonderLeyen
Despite this week's video call between Biden and Putin, #Russia is likely to continue its pressure on the #US over #Ukraine: 
#WriteforRights: Sphere NGO in Kharkiv is an #LGBTI &amp; women’s rights NGO in #Ukraine. Sphere has been attacked almost 30 times since 2017, leaving the organization &amp; supporters in constant fear.  Please call on @MVS_UA to protect Sphere NGO. #W4R21 &gt;&gt;&gt;  
#West will never keep its word on admitting #Ukraine into #NATO, says #Russia's MP 
I suspect 2022 will see: #Israel and #Iran go at it, #Russia and #Ukraine do handbags and I reckon that #China may make a move on #Taiwan if #Russia goes big. Also we will see civil unrest in most #Western countries. But that’s just birth pains. #DoNotPanic #LookUp #Jesus

#Russia demanded on Friday that #NATO rescind a 2008 commitment to #Ukraine and #Georgia that they would one day become members and said the alliance should promise not to deploy weapons in countries bordering Russia that could threaten its security.
Just dusted off my 1996 copy of Huntington's Clash of Civilizations, and indeed, memory served me correctly: Huntington did recommend to let Russia have #Ukraine as their sphere of influence "unless Ukraine splits into two countries." #Donbas 
In #Ukraine, President @ZelenskyyUa said that he does not exclude the idea of holding a referendum on the status of the occupied #Donbas region:

If the US is unwilling to support #Ukraine with American troops &amp; airpower we are not true allies.  The threat of "increased economic sanctions" Biden mentioned in his call with #Putin does absolutely nothing to deter a dictator that steals from his people already #RussiaInvasion 
Sad that they have a publisher locked up in a prison cell and the war criminals free to continue to manufacture wars. They don't care about collateral damage aka innocent lives lost  #FreeAssange #FirstAmmendment #CivilRights #Syria #Ukraine #EndlessWar 
Let's be clear about who the aggressor is...  #Ukraine isn't attacking #Russia.  Russia attacked Ukraine, and is planning an invasion.  They are the invaders, and they are the bad actors on the stage.
Once, upon a time, where was a great, same nation with a great outlook at life.  #Russia #Ukraine Growing up in the Soviet Union: a short story about Russia and Ukraine  via @wordpressdotcom
The world is yet again silent. "I don't care about Ukraine." "It's their fight, leave them be." A warning to humanity was dismissed. How many of you I wonder know that there is an actual concentration camp in Donbas run by Russia-backed occupants? #Ukraine #RussiaInvadedUkraine 
Conflict in the Ukraine: Do Americans Realize What Is at Stake? by Maria Francesca Gritsch #Ukraine #Russia #NATO #BlackSea   
Military experts urging @POTUS to pledge to defend #Ukraine from massive invasion are the same old crowd that never met a war it didn’t like. If Russia does invade, inevitable early successes will face worldwide condemnation and a heroic people who will fight them door to door.
NATO Sec. Gen. Stoltenberg: Every Russian action against Ukraine will come at a severe cost. #XGlobalMarkets #NATO #Ukraine #Russian
#Breaking: NATO Secretary General states that every Russian  act of aggression to Ukraine would come at a high price. Bold statement by NATO in the wake of words being tossed by both sides. #Russia #Ukraine #NATO
