People who gave their entire professional lives for the global #nuclear non-proliferation movement, if they're honest with themselves, now must be really itching to spit or urinate in #Obama's and #Biden's faces for the latter's #Ukraine decisions.
Each time a top Westerner says "NATO won't go to war over #Ukraine" is yet another nail in the coffin of the #nuclear non-proliferation. From 2014 onwards, it now takes a really dumb ignorant state leader to have means for acquiring weapons of mass destruction but don't do so.

If #Russia does in-fact decide to invade #Ukraine, I highly doubt #NATO or the US will fight the Russian aggression. However lethal aid will spike, and we will likely see a geographical redline somewhere in Ukraine that they warn Russia to not pass, or face military response.

It is courageous Russian civilians who document Putin's troop deployment (not the 25 or more German and hundreds of foreign correspondents in the country).  We should be grateful to them for providing us with a picture of the preparation for aggression.  #PutinInWar #Ukraine 
#UK troops will not be deployed to #Ukraine to defend against Russia "We shouldn't kid people we would," Ben Wallace told the Spectator magazine. "...not a member of Nato, so it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to send troops into Ukraine".
