What would be domestic political reaction in the US to a major war between #Ukraine and #Russia? #Putin 
UNless #Biden tells #Putin 2 shut it-- get out of #UKRAINE as he's the invading aggressor--then tell #ZELENSKY that ##Russia will comply or else #Ukraine gets automatic membership in #NATO, #Biden has accomplished nothing! #Zelensky:you stay firm if #BIDEN gets weak knees! 
Important issues about #ukraine under threat from #Russia and @KremlinRussia_E from @FukuyamaFrancis

I know this #Russia #Ukraine #US situation is pretty tense and can have dire consequences, but the IR nerd in me can’t help but think that this is a fascinating case in diplomacy 
@giuliomerelli @MarkAmesExiled ooh so that's why Ukrainians decided to join the #nazi forces and participated in #WarCrimes by aiding committing #Holocaust against Jewish civilians. You are one sick dude who glorifies and justifies Nazi activities during #WWII. #Ukraine.

As Russia prepares to invade Ukraine, I’m reminded of that dangerous buffoon’s (Trump) contention that NATO is irrelevant. This week we're coordinating with our NATO allies to deter Russian aggression. Thankful a sane grown-up is in the White House. #Ukraine #UkrainiansWillResist
"December 7th" #Putin #Ukraine #UkrainiansWillResist #Russia 
SO TRUE! FIX IT!! Tomorrow, #BIDEN- leader of the democratic world--must tell #Putin that if he invades #Ukraine or kills another soldier or civilian in his illegal, murderous war there, #Ukraine gets automatic #NTO membership!  That's leadership!! Everything else blah, blah... 
Why is #Putin not wanting #Ukraine to join #NATO?

If Putin wants to go full-mob-boss, he'll invade #Ukraine  the moment he hangs up the phone with Biden tomorrow. Remember, boys and girls, weakness invites aggression. Always.

Quoted in Mohammed Ataya's article on the use of the #Turkish Bayraktar drones by #Ukraine against pro-#Russian separatists, Ukraine &amp; Russia's military, and on #Russia-#Turkey relations &amp; tensions over the drones &amp; potential Kremlin invasion of Ukraine.

With #Russia poised for a major assault on #Ukraine's sovereignty, can this key partner count on America's support?   Hudson Senior Fellow shared his reflections earlier this year in @TheNatlInterest.  
President Zelenskiy says #Ukraine’s armed forces are capable of fighting off any attack from #Russia as the country marks its national army day with a display of #US armored vehicles and patrol boats.

#FactCheck   #Ukraine signed #BudapestMemorandum under the West and   in particular #US pressure because missiles were aimed at US This memorandum gave only "security assurances", not as Ukraine interpreted "security guarantees"  
🇺🇦 Zelenskiy visited the positions of the Ukrainian army at the contact line in Donbass.   He congratulated the servicemen on the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, talked with the military and presented them with valuable gifts.   #Ukraine #Russia 
🇺🇦⚡️🇷🇺This train with the 2S9 "Nona-S" self-propelled guns unloaded on December 2 in Crimea  #Russia #Ukraine 
The American military, headed by the Defense Attaché at the US Embassy in Kiev, Colonel Brittany Stewart, congratulated the Ukrainian Armed Forces on its 30th anniversary, writing down an appeal in which "there is no better partner for Ukraine than the United States."  #Ukraine 
If the findings in this article are close to reality there is no deterrence planned by the US or NATO that would be strong enough to prevent #Russia from invading #Ukraine . If the European states are waiting for the US to save the issue for them they might be in for a surprise. 
Do join me 21GMT @AJEnglish Newshour.  #US confirms #DiplomaticBoycott of #Beijing #Olympics. Analysis with @McCannSportsLaw. Plus build up to #Biden #Putin summit- we talk about   #Ukraine tensions with @KadriLiik, Policy Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
Would a Russian invasion of #Ukraine be considered a "gray rhino"? AKA, a highly probable, high impact yet neglected threat?
Is it true that #CharlesAFlynn has privately contacted #Putin to let #Russia know that he, Charles Flynn, will stand down the United States Army Pacific should Putin invade #Ukraine. Even if @Potus should command otherwise. #GOPTraitors #RussiaInvadedUkraine
➡ Parliamentarians from #Poland, #Ukraine and #Lithuania on Monday condemned #Russia for its aggression against Ukraine and #Belarus for creating a migrant crisis on its border with the European Union. 
Interesting analysis on the #Ukraine crisis. 
@ThevibeKilling @wrongname46 LOL #Russia isn't going to initiate any invasion of #Ukraine, but if it ever came to war, Ukraine's military would be annihilated
#Ukraine #Russia  The New York Times has published latest satellite images of the Russian build up near the Ukr border. But a lot of the footage shows  already existing bases in western Russia &amp; #Crimea 
« The fact that #Ukraine has taken a different political path from Russia raises awkward questions for the Kremlin which likes to argue that“western liberalism”is completely unsuited to🇷🇺 Perhaps that is the real reason why 🇺🇦 excites such fury in Putin »  
Your daily reminder that #RussiaInvadedUkraine , annexed #Crimea , still occupies part of Eastern #Ukraine and still wages war on #Ukraine  #RussiaIsATerroristState #CrimeaIsNotRussia  #CrimeaIsUkraine 🇺🇦  #UkraineIsEurope 🇪🇺 #UkrainiansWillResist  
The European energy crisis is not abating. Here’s my take on why that is and what the west should do about it. #EU #energy #gazprom #russia #moldova #ukraine
