With #Russia poised for a major assault on #Ukraine's sovereignty, can this key partner count on America's support?   Hudson Senior Fellow shared his reflections earlier this year in @TheNatlInterest.  
President Zelenskiy says #Ukraine‚Äôs armed forces are capable of fighting off any attack from #Russia as the country marks its national army day with a display of #US armored vehicles and patrol boats.

#FactCheck   #Ukraine signed #BudapestMemorandum under the West and   in particular #US pressure because missiles were aimed at US This memorandum gave only "security assurances", not as Ukraine interpreted "security guarantees"  
üá∫üá¶ Zelenskiy visited the positions of the Ukrainian army at the contact line in Donbass.   He congratulated the servicemen on the Day of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, talked with the military and presented them with valuable gifts.   #Ukraine #Russia

The American military, headed by the Defense Attach√© at the US Embassy in Kiev, Colonel Brittany Stewart, congratulated the Ukrainian Armed Forces on its 30th anniversary, writing down an appeal in which "there is no better partner for Ukraine than the United States."  #Ukraine 
If the findings in this article are close to reality there is no deterrence planned by the US or NATO that would be strong enough to prevent #Russia from invading #Ukraine . If the European states are waiting for the US to save the issue for them they might be in for a surprise. 
Do join me 21GMT @AJEnglish Newshour.  #US confirms #DiplomaticBoycott of #Beijing #Olympics. Analysis with @McCannSportsLaw. Plus build up to #Biden #Putin summit- we talk about   #Ukraine tensions with @KadriLiik, Policy Fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
Would a Russian invasion of #Ukraine be considered a "gray rhino"? AKA, a highly probable, high impact yet neglected threat?
Is it true that #CharlesAFlynn has privately contacted #Putin to let #Russia know that he, Charles Flynn, will stand down the United States Army Pacific should Putin invade #Ukraine. Even if @Potus should command otherwise. #GOPTraitors #RussiaInvadedUkraine
‚û° Parliamentarians from #Poland, #Ukraine and #Lithuania on Monday condemned #Russia for its aggression against Ukraine and #Belarus for creating a migrant crisis on its border with the European Union. 
Interesting analysis on the #Ukraine crisis. 
@ThevibeKilling @wrongname46 LOL #Russia isn't going to initiate any invasion of #Ukraine, but if it ever came to war, Ukraine's military would be annihilated
#Ukraine #Russia  The New York Times has published latest satellite images of the Russian build up near the Ukr border. But a lot of the footage shows  already existing bases in western Russia &amp; #Crimea 
¬´¬†The fact that #Ukraine has taken a different political path from Russia raises awkward questions for the Kremlin which likes to argue that‚Äúwestern liberalism‚Äùis completely unsuited toüá∑üá∫ Perhaps that is the real reason why üá∫üá¶ excites such fury in Putin¬†¬ª
