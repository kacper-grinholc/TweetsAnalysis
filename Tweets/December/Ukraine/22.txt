We can either have peace backed by international law, or escalating war, invasion &amp; annexation.  To have the former we need to deter Putin by arming #Ukraine, opening a rapid path to their membership in @NATO &amp; massively sanctioning his corrupt, rapacious, criminal clique.

Some good news amid growing #Ukraine tensions. Participants at today's round of #peace negotiations have agreed to fully adhere to #ceasefire in #Donbas.  Ukraine says this offers "a restrained optimism to de-escalate the situation in eastern Ukraine &amp; unblock the peace process" 
I don't agree with this, mainly due to costs war would mean for #Ukraine and Ukrainians. But it offers interesting perspective on costs for #Russia, costs that Kremlin may well underestimate.
Interesting perspective on #Russia-#Ukraine crisis.  West should take hard line with Moscow. If Kremlin goes to war, so be it. Results: - galvanized anti-Russia sentiment in Europe - crippling sanctions - Russia stuck in military morass

I think the best thing for #Ukraine is to make sure everybody is well fed. That may be a strategic advantage.
@gpovanman @BBCNews repeat "Supreme b/s"  #UK has the reputation of sewer rats 'cos of this filthy corrupted .gov system; it's beginning to make #Ukraine's system look clean  It won't wash  This news broke as @bankofengland issued negative interest rate bonds 5/2020   
Looks like many women in #Ukraine will now have to register with the military and be ready for call-up, as men over 18 have always done.   Defense Ministry order shows a list with hundreds of professions to which it’s applicable, including photographers and journalists.

Mario Draghi is a good man and a smart man.   It's sad to see him subjugating himself and all of Europe to a murderer like Putin and buying into the hagiography that Putin is powerful and Russia is successful.  #Russia is a failed state and #Putin deeply unpopular. #Ukraine

Putin warns of possible military response over ‘aggressive’ Nato. But the military build up on #Ukraine border is being done by Russia, not the West.  Putin's sabre-rattling is to distract public attention from his regime's corruption &amp; economic failings 
Yes, Europe has leverage over Russia, if you have the guts to use it.  No, you don't need to keep talking to Putin.  Just rid yourselves of your addiction to Russian energy and Oligarch money.  #Russia #Ukraine #Putin  
So #Putin has made up his mind about invading #Ukraine with a guarantee of absolute success.

#Russia seems to have a sincere concern on failed agreements between them and the #USA  and if you follow chronological events, you too will agree that the U.S. has dropped the ball in many different ways.  Now #Ukraine is getting entangled; just saying.

Time will tell if #Ukraine really can count on the US for protection against #Russia. 
It may surprise some to see #Ukraine appear among the leaders in my recent @TauGlobal research.  The country is very dynamic technologically, especially its West. I often think #Putin values it for this as much as for historical reasons.  /2
