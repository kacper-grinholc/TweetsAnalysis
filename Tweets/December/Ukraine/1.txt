Situation in #Ukraine is much more tense than in spring this year. - protests in Kiev  - troop build up by Kiev near Donbas is higher - Russian troops now also in Belarus - rhetoric of NATO and Russia also much more aggressive - increased mutual shelling (artillery / mortars)
#NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, speaking at the #Reuters conference, said #Russia would pay 'a high price' for #Ukraine aggression? Maybe the first #victimes will be #Norway or #Brussels? It's sad when grown men always want to #play #war like #children

@Ahk14061 @27khv @jensstoltenberg The only way NATO can help its partners is when one of them comes under direct attack activating Article 5. #Ukraine is not a member so does not fall under this.
You guys see whats going on in #Ukraine ? Over 100,000 Russian troops guessed to be at the border. @NATO sent several thousand troops to Poland over it. Probably just Russian posturing. What do you think?
Your reminder to watch the border between #Russia and #Ukraine. Do not let Vladimir Putin decide the fate of free Ukrainians. #HumanRights

@SameeraKhan @JSoresa 🇪🇹 is a failed project from the get-go. Cold War emboldened #US failed to assess the new 🌏 order. #Sudan, #Nicaragua, #Ukraine is just of few blunders. 🇪🇹 is unique where #US FP principles were ignored due to personal connections to #TPLF rather well oiled #US policy.

Russia's military is fitting slat armor umbrellas &amp; heat decoys to T-72, T-80 #tanks near #Ukraine border, apparently to mitigate threat of Kiev's #Javelin #missiles &amp; #BayraktarTb2 + other #drones. How impactful could those arms, and their counters, be?

@SecBlinken in #Riga, #Latvia:  "We are prepared to impose severe costs for further #Russian aggression in #Ukraine.  #NATO is prepared to reinforce its defenses on the eastern flank." 
I met @trussliz today. We exchanged views on the ongoing crises in #Ukraine &amp; #Ethiopia.   We also discussed our shared commitment to Indo-Pacific and Arctic engagement and obtaining justice from #Iran on the downing of Flight #PS752.   We'll stay in touch. 🇨🇦🇬🇧 
Just yesterday, I was in Nevelske, which is located right at the “contact line”. Out of 45 people who remained there, 42 left due to the spike in hostilities. This is a sad reminder of why humanitarian work matters for people in eastern #Ukraine.

Good that Jewish community in #Dnipro has confidence in the police investigation into this #antisemitic incident, as do I. The #menorah represents a time in history when Jews fought oppression and won. Maybe the perpetrators should read the story #ukraine
