How did the whole #russia #ukraine thing spark up again? Feels like it just came out of nowhere. Maybe they should just negotiate a real estate donation deal.
Patrolling a trench separating Kiev's army from pro-Moscow rebels in eastern #Ukraine, a young Ukrainian soldier says he is prepared for a #Russian invasion. "The enemy will not pass," says 27-year-old Oleksandr
American Institute for the Study of War (#ISW) gave its forecast regarding the so-expected "Russian invasion of #Ukraine". According to them, springboards for launching operations will be #Crimea, #Belarus and #Russia mainland but they don't expect a war during winter.

Further, it’s unsettling to read #Putin’s essay on unity between #Russians and #Ukrainians.  Maybe this is a hot take, but “#Ukraine is #Russia” may be the new “Austria ist Deutschland” line of Germanic peoples of the 1930’s…  
@nseskuria @VladDavidzon @ForeignPolicy The West has spent millions helping #Ukraine build democratic institutions, promoting free enterprise and the Rule of Law.  Walking away from Ukraine in the hour of it's greatest need would make a mockery of #Biden's Summit of Democracies. Why would anyone trust our  word?

Johnson warns Putin of deep concern over #Ukraine 
Fighting was heard in the #Donbass earlier today. In Marinka and Trudivs'ke, #Donetsk.  Matthew 24:6 - Wars #Ukraine #Russia
On the surface, this seems to hint at why #Putin is posturing 100k troops on #Ukraine border, and refuses to allow any #NATO expansion east: it would keep him from restoring the former USSR if that’s his dream. 
The European Union stands united and firm in support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.   Any aggression against #Ukraine will come with political consequences and with a high economic cost for Russia.  #FAC    
This isn't a new discovery. This is not spontaneous.  The angle of the story is you've let this happen and now the people to solve it are the ones who created it.  #Ukraine  Whether Ukrainian's kept saying it. Remind yourself no one listened. Act accordingly without animosity. 
#Ukraine - #Russia and #NATO war drums! Matthew 24:6 - Rumors of wars

#Ukraine #Russia #USA  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei #Ryabkov said that if there is no reaction from #NATO &amp; the US to Russia's demand for security guarantees, a military response will follow (not necessarily an invasion) 
On my way out of St Sophie’s cathedral. You can never just walk through the entrance. You cannot help but stop and stare #Ukraine 
So far #Ukraine has exported 28.3 million tonnes of #grain in the 2021-22 season, an increase of 21% from the same period a year ago. #WorldGrain  
Saying it's unfair is unfair.  No one knew Germany had it's own agenda?   No one knew Russia was an enemy of the Ukrainian state? Yes they did.   There was no other way to procure weapons? That's a problem  This is and always was an opportunity.  Or else it's insanity. #Ukraine 
Satellite images show #Russian military forces massing near #Ukraine’s border.  Image on the left taken on Sept 7th shows Russian forces in #Soloti near the border with Ukraine.  Image on the right shows the same location Dec 5th. 
Well okay then.. But if freedom ends where others begins.. wouldn’t that mean they would be free to join an alliance? #Russia #NATO #Ukraine

Good read by @marcthiessen on the situation in #Ukraine &amp; how the actions of the Biden admin are rewarding #Russian aggression, rather than making it clear that any attack on Ukraine will be met with severe consequences.

I think it is futile to predict whether Russia will be expanding its military presence in #Ukraine. What matters is the context and where Ukraine remains the only unsolved problem for Moscow. We need to pay closer attention to the utterances and writings of Russian officials.
Foreign Minister #Asselborn underlined that the EU must remain firm and continue to defend its values and international law, be it in #Ukraine, in #Afghanistan or in #Ethiopia  Press release ➡️
