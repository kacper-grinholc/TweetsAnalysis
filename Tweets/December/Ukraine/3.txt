#Ukraine talks of Russian invasion. Ukraine has put half its army. 125,000 men on the borders of the breakaway Donbass republics. More likely, Ukraine will invade Donbass &amp; Russia will respond. This build up is to make Putin, Russia into "bad guys". Be careful about believing
#Russia takes #Crimea and the #Donbas under #Obama, nothing under #Trump, and now they will take the entirety of #Ukraine under #Biden. All without any significant response. Maybe expel some diplomats or minor sanctions, but that's it.
