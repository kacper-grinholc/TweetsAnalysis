Interesting thread worth reading on #Russia #Ukraine 
#Putin is really using warmongering rhetoric- ‘we have nowhere further to retreat’. It evokes 1941 just before the battle for #Moscow. He talks about the US deploying hypersonic weapons in #Ukraine, about encouraging extremists groups to encroach on Russia, in particularly Crimea 
🤣🤣🤣  #US and #UK Intel cancelled "#Russia invasion of #Ukraine"  They replaced it with "Russian cyberattacks that take down the electric grid, the banking system, and other critical components of Ukraine’s economy and government" instead 🤣    1/ 
He may invade #Ukraine because reasons, but that’s partly since he knows #NATO will not intervene militarily. #Russia will pay a heavy price in other ways, though.  Interesting times, indeed.  “#Putin says Russia has 'nowhere to retreat' over Ukraine”

Unfortunately, a sound analysis. Nonetheless, let's hope it turns out wrong #Russia #Ukraine 
One of the smartest commentaries on #Ukraine from former US Ambassador to Kyiv &amp; arms control expert @steven_pifer. In addition to pressure to deter Russia from further assaults on Ukraine, where/how could diplomatic engagement help stave off a new military crisis? 
In 1991 US guaranteed the neutrality of #Ukraine as a buffer state between #Russia and NATO.  Then Obama funded riots in #Kiev, which overthrew the democratic government, drew Ukraine into NATO camp and and threatened Russian security by putting NATO troops on the border 
Putin addressing an extended meeting of Russia's Defense Ministry:  "Russia has nowhere further to retreat. Does NATO really think we’ll sit idly as they create threats against us? We must now make an important decision."   #Putin #Russia #Ukraine #NATO
Why should the #US approve sale and/or MilAid to #Ukraine of lethal weapons like #Patriot &amp; other antiiair, #Javelin antitank, anti-UAV gun etc. systems ASAP? Because it's better to have them &amp; not need them, than need &amp; not have when Putin decides to escalate.
Why odds are in favor of #Putin invading #Ukraine 
Tensions are rising. 🧐#Ukraine #Russia #Putin #Nato #USA   Putin warns of possible military response over ‘aggressive’ Nato 
@itvnews From the lunatic who invaded &amp; annexed #Crimea, nobody believes #Putin while he threatens the #Ukraine with massed troops on their boarder.
#Georgia and #Ukraine's membership in #NATO is a direct threat to Russia's national security, and violating Moscow's "red line" could have irreparable consequences for the West and for the international system.
If a war with #Russia and #Ukraine on a massive scale occurs, it has the very real possibility of affecting you and your loved one's lives in a huge way. Gas pipelines, stores, websites, GPS, other satellites, and other key infrastructure all could be taken offline. 1/2

#Russia Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu claims that #US private military companies have stationed troops in the #Donetsk region of eastern #Ukraine and are preparing a “provocation using unknown chemical components” 
Just more rhetoric, or does #Putin actually believe what he's saying in this speech???  His perspective may be that #Russia has true cause to feel cornered; and that could result in actually physically lashing out, rather than just expressing the threat  #US #Ukraine 
So where is the Ukrainian government ahead of them both?  Where are Zelenskyy's press conferences establishing the Ukrainian position so there is no miscommunication on where #Ukraine stands?  Where is the country that is being attacked? Why let others control the narrative?
