The northeastern regions will face the highest temperature increase. These are Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk Oblasts. Rising temperatures will also lead to an increase in extreme weather events such as storms, flooding, and droughts. #Ukraine #GlobalWarming 
@WorldBankECA has conducted an extensive study on how climate change will impact Ukraine. Two options are examined. 1. No mitigation efforts - temp rises 4.3°C by the year 2100 2. Sufficient mitigation - temp rises 2.4°C by 2100. A thread⬇️  #Ukraine #Kyiv
#ALERT  Highly suspicious activity at #US EMBASSY Kyiv, Rostov-On-Don, and Crimea airfields. #Ukraine  Reports earlier that #Russia|n logistical and medical assets are in place within Donetsk and western Russia.   Additional unusual combat aircraft activity near Belarus border.
What diplomatic path is there?  US has demonstrated yet again “you can never trust the word of America” In 1991, at end of Cold War and with break up of USSR, US and Russia recognized neutrality of #Ukraine. Then US funded Kiev riots which resulted in Ukraine being in NATO camp 
#US is ready to discuss Russia's concerns, but won't publicly announce issues to be discussed. Significant progress is possible in the dialogue with the #Russia. #Biden will inform #Putin that there are diplomatic opportunities for de-escalation around #Ukraine. /White House/ 
@BostonsBuddha I believe you're right. That was his stance as VP, which Obama did but limited. I expect a larger approach from Biden and larger arms exports to #Ukraine.
Genocidal Racist US killed tens of millions in South America, Africa, Middle East, Asia.  Next target #EU #Ukraine and #Taiwan helped by #BBC in US servitude @UKParliament.  Long range missiles to source of weapon manufacture will be only way to stop US planned genocide.
