"Russians already know that international victories don't just lead to a sense of national pride but are also followed by crackdown at home and falling living standards." #Ukraine    
The world‚Äôs wealthiest democracies @G7 on Saturday sought to present a #united front against #Russian aggression towards #Ukraine as #Britain hosted a meeting of foreign ministers in #Liverpool. #G7 
#UK often uses ‚Äúeventual Russian aggression against #Ukraine‚Äù bogus slogan, when in fact it is üá¨üáßarmed forces that aggressively advance towards üá∑üá∫borders in Poland &amp; Estonia, and üá¨üáßmilitary chiefs openly aiming to achieve military presence in Arctic.  üí¨  
#US provocation and escalation of tensions  First time USAF RC135W JAKE11 enters #Ukraine airspace, flies over #Donbass and close to #Russia border  1.   2.   3.   1/

"As #Russia's troop build-up near its border with #Ukraine raises alarm bells in Washington and across Europe, the Biden administration is consulting with allies and considering an unprecedented sanctions package" @CNASdc experts on growing tensions.  
#Russia Wants #NATO to Ditch Plans for #Ukraine and #Georgia Membership 
 Starting Monday, snow is expected in western #Ukraine. #globalwarminghoax @nytimes #propaganda
The #CrimeaPlatform aims to elaborate practical approaches to bringing attention to the situation in Crimea &amp; discussing opportunities for its return to #Ukraine. Register for our joint event w/ @UA_Analytica &amp; @UKRinDEU next Monday via events@dgap.org. 
No one has to do anything for #Ukraine  They are content with the status quo.  Appeasers are in power. Enabling Russia. Where is the denial stemming from? When does the acceptance happen?  Ukraine's war it should have fought centuries ago. Finally putting Russian's in their place 
@WeTheBrandon @JoeBiden It's not will, it's the fact that Russia can crush us militarily in #Ukraine, and there's nothing we can do about it.   That's without the privileged sanctuary in Russia. Bomb Russia, and all our carriers would be at the bottom of the ocean, and things would be blowing up here.
As fresh tensions build up between the US and #Russia over reported military build-up near #Ukraine border, Moscow has now clarified that President #VladmirPutin has no plans to launch an offensive against the neighbouring country 
War-weariness in #Russia as military tension with #Ukraine rises 
"[@JoeBiden] said we won't defend #Ukraine militarily..." stop right there, then. History is determined by those who want to win more than the other side. Russia yearns for E. Ukraine whereas the West gaslights Kiev. Game over. Move on. 
What's happening at the #Russia-#Ukraine border. 
Biden gets tough on Putin, just like he did with China... #putin #Biden #Russia #Ukraine #China #Olympics 
@TrumpCritic @DmytroKuleba Of course not, it's suicide. We expect the kids in the #Ukraine trenches to be the patsies.
People get murdered all of the time in Cleveland, Ohio.  Please forgive me for not caring too much about the relationship between Russia and Ukraine.  Ukraine is not better than Russia.  Ukraine is a smaller, weaker Russia that does the same things as Russia.  #Ukraine #Russia
@PilibSandair @brainiac3397 @Hyperpop_Imam @MaitreyaBhakal Since when did the west care about  the rules? West  have blatantly disregarded international law any time that suits them. West should stop dreaming about taking Donestk &amp; Luganstk by force &amp; make sure Ukraine implement Minsk agreement. #Russia #Ukraine
@TrumpCritic Because Russia will invade #Ukraine and slaughter them?
To Putin! #Ukraine 
Just in: @StateDept A/S Karen Donfried to travel to Kyiv &amp; Moscow next week to meet w/ senior officials to discuss #Russia‚Äôs military buildup &amp; to reinforce U.S. commitment to #Ukraine‚Äôs sovereignty, independence &amp; territorial integrity.

Well I can pretty much say neither will happen, NATO has already said they will not back down from 2008 promise, nor is ending training and logistical assistance a likelihood. Sounds more like a justification for a future conflict to me.. #NATO #Ukraine #Russia

@naveed360 And the answer is, no #Ukraine can't defend itself. It will be slaughtered, unless Russia shows mercy.

@DuddleyDuddley #Ukraine promised to negotiate with the rebels, and now they refuse. Simple to solve, they need to honor the peace treaty. Or pay the price.
The US is sending top diplomat for #Europe, Donfried to  #Russia and #Ukraine to talk about the #Russian troop buildup near the #Ukrainian border and to confirm #US commitment to the sovereignty of Ukraine the State Department said on Saturday.  Read More:

A Russian army soldier takes part in drills at the #Kadamovskiy firing range in the #Rostov region in southern #Russia ! #Russian troop concentration near #Ukraine has raised #Ukrainian &amp; Western concerns of a possible invasion that #Moscow has dismissed. #UkraineWillResist 
#NATO is not budging to #Russia‚Äôs diktat but the question is if it can defend #Ukraine against an invasion.
