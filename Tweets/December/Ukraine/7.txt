@olgatokariuk #Ukraine's attempt to destruct the long term relations between #Russia and other European nations won't be successful. Instead, Ukraine should concentrate on building, constructive, respectful relations with those European nations &amp; get used to it. Europe won't boycott Russia.
Great, so now Putin is doing a reverse wag the dog to try to get attention on @POTUS and foreign policy. #Ukraine
This is the correct position to hold. And no, it doesn't mean that anyone is clamouring for WW3. #politics #Russia #Ukraine 
#Biden warned #Putin the West would impose #sanctions on #Russia, military support for #Ukraine if Russia invades Ukraine.  Putin demanded guarantees #NATO would not expand further eastward.  #NordStream2 on the line; #JCPOA #nuclear deal revival also. 
U.S. President Joe Biden-Russian President Vladimir Putin call  Putin demands security guarantees from Biden to curb NATO expansion. U.S. says allies would bolster #Ukraine if Russia attacks #GeoPolitics #Russia #USA #NATO #CSTO  
Poor #Ukraine. President Biden has indicated military action is NOT on the table. The biggest tool in the West's armoury appears to be sanctions, only. 
How can we believe this when #Biden lacks the courage to answer unscripted questions from the press &amp; just scampers away?!?  #Putin #BidenPutin #BidenDelivers #Russia #Ukraine #BidenAdministration  
The main question for #Putin in today’s meeting with #Biden is new guarantees about #NATO without #Ukraine. Maybe Russian forces in Ukrainian border now are argument for this Putin’s goal. But only Ukrainians will decide about their future. #UkrainiansWillResist
#Ukraine #Biden. Kudos to Biden and the others.Striking contrast to Putin Loving Trump who would have gladly given Ukraine to Putin for all of his favors to him and family.
@newsmax Poor #Putin sat through 2 hours of Babbling #Biden, on behalf of all Americans, we’re sorry. #Ukraine #LetsGoBrandon #Drinking 
Readout: Vladimir #Putin had a telephone conversation w President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip #Erdogan at the latter’s initiative...    #Russia #Turkey #relations #energy #agriculture #Syria #Libya #Azerbaijan #Armenia #NagornoKarabakh #Ukraine
#Ukraine’s position has been weakened by West’s moral relativism (overlooking Putin atrocities &amp; hostilities for “diplomacy”); economic greed (Nordstream2); strategic weakness (Biden waffling on military aid) inability to enforce agreements (Minsk) &amp; keep commitments (Budapest). 
Putin continues sending troops to Ukraine's border while saying he will not invade Ukraine. #Russia #Ukraine #troops #border
Watch how @RepMikeTurner took a jab at Fmr Pres. Obama with a LIE that was told by late Sen. McCain *and* the “former guy.” @jaketapper *barely* pushed back. The media is not equipped to handle lying Republicans. cc: @TimsDesiree. #CNN #TheLead #Ukraine #PoliticsOnMyMind 
Again #Russia is menacing #Ukraine claiming its neighbor is a failed state controlled by Western forces but Ukrainians are generally happy to engage with the West! This 2019 article is good background for today’s events  @jesuitseurope #Putin 
@OhNoezzz @abdulibyan9 @JackDetsch #Russia never intended to invade #Ukraine. Unless #Zelensky and his handlers do sth very stupid and attack the #donbass but even that is unlikely to be met by an intervention with  Russian ground troups. Lots of idiots are playing with fire here and 99% of the media are complicit
Everyone knows Kremlin's parallel universe (#NATO invades #Ukraine) reproduced by its propaganda. The most surprising is that this nonsense is found in an official statement after the meeting with an US president. Putin does not even try to maintain the appearance of credibility.
