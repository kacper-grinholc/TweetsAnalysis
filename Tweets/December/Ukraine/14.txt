US Lawmakers Urge Pre-emptive Sanctions, #Ukraine Arms To Deter #Putin  
#Ukraine Allows Foreign Forces to Join Planned 2022 Military Drills 
Dec 14 - #US lawmakers who have just returned from a trip to #Ukraine are urging the Biden administration to take proactive steps to prevent further Russian aggression toward the country     
Listen to @RepAdamSchiff as he leads @HouseIntel Committee's probe into Trump's abuses of presidential power concerning #Russia &amp; #Ukraine or read his book: "Midnight In Washington". 
@McFaul #Ukraine is not a part of the West. Do you really think that #Crimea is going to return to them? No chance. Why would #Merkel halt weaponry to #Ukraine? What happens when #Mutti joins a #Russian energy board? Our fight is with #China.  They are a threat to our way of life. Period
A group of #US lawmakers calls for pre-emptive sanctions on #Russia and expanded arms shipments to #Ukraine, fearing that action so far may not dissuade President Vladimir #Putin from invading. 
Experts say #Russia can inflict massive damage to #Ukraine in less then an hour: “They can devastate the Ukrainian military in the east really quickly, within the first 30-40 minutes.” As it gets “hybrid aggression”, Kiev is inviting US+#NATO! 
#Geopolitics  Interesting times for #CzarPutin: his relentless efforts to "return" #Ukraine to "mother Russia" fold seem to encounter another hiccup:#Moldova decided to join the #EU &amp; is warning #Russia not to interfere  ... what is the world coming to ...
Among the 1.6 million internally displaced persons in #Ukraine (a result of the separatist action) are children, many of whom have only known life frm within their fenced compound, #children who have never even seen their "homes" Can you help?🙏 #ChristmasMiracle needed⤵

There are growing signs that the leaders in Donbas are trying to build an identity that separates them from both #Ukraine and #Russia. What does this mean for the future of the conflict?  My comment: 
#Russia’s President Vladimir Putin tells his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinisto that he wants “immediate” talks with the United States and #NATO over security guarantees, the Kremlin says as tensions mount over #Ukraine. 
Hello, @CIA @FBI @StateDeptSpox @StateDept, I heard about the #Bipartisan group visiting #Ukraine, am wondering who has what briefings? This was odd to me. ? 
The issue of acces of #Crimea|ns to safe drinking #water 💧and sanitary services should be considered in the context of #HumanRights . Water blockade of the peninsula by #Ukraine directly impacts economic and humanitarian interests of ordinary Crimeans. 
Let me say this again: #Ukraine is #Russia's redline!  #Moscow has raised the possibility of deploying intermediate-range nuclear missiles against the backdrop of the thorny issue of Ukraine. 
🇺🇦💥🇷🇺|| 🇺🇸🇩🇪🇫🇷  ✅ #Ukraine is facing a serious threat from #Russia.  ➡️ The #US sells Ukraine words  ➡️ The #EU (#Germany-#France) avoids escalation with 🇷🇺  ➡️ 🇩🇪 blocks #NATO weapons to 🇺🇦  ⚠️ No surprise if they blame🇺🇦next — ✅We saw a lighter v of this 🎥🍿. #Turkey-#Syria 
@worldonalert There will not be a major operation against #Ukraine because it presents obvious risks to the #Kremlin regime. Minor skirmishes, provocations, staged terrorist attacks are what #Russia has under its sleeves.
Hey #Putin...#Ukraine didn't invade #Russia...RUSSIA invaded Ukraine ...so fuck off
#Putin accuses #Ukraine of being pumped up with modern weapons...what a joke...Is Putin actually scared that Ukraine will invade #Russia?
Opinion💭by @TheJohnRobson  Supposedly there’s this united Western front against a possible Russian invasion of #Ukraine. Except #France, as usual.  But united in resolve and united in fatuity aren’t quite the same thing. 
Russian President Vladimir #Putin and his Chinese counterpart, #XiJinping , are scheduled to discuss the tense situation in #Europe and #NATO's belligerent rhetoric as tensions escalate between Moscow and Washington over #Ukraine. 
With this amount of wisdom. Watching the West and Russia fuck over #Ukraine again. Are Ukrainian's the commentators of the world?  Who chose not to see this coming? Shaming the West in making the same mistakes from WW2 is doubly embarrassing that we are here now then. Clarity? 🤷‍♂️

#Putin has expressed concern about US missiles in #Ukraine that could strike Moscow in minutes. That is legitimate security concern.  However, #Russia's desire to have veto over Kyiv's foreign policy choices is not legitimate claim. 3/3 
There is discussion to be had on broader European security issues. But it should: - not take place with threat of #Russian invasion hanging over #Ukraine  - address security concerns of all European states, including Ukraine - focus on legitimate security concerns 2/3

Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that the expansion of NATO military activity to Ukraine constitutes a “direct threat” to the security of his country. #Russia #nato #Ukraine 
Week after Biden-Putin meeting, crunch time coming.. NATO still arming Ukraine and threatening borders.  Russia&gt; “Our response will be military” @Antimilitarist2 @OTANno_AND @platnoalaguerra @ExtinctionR @nonuclearwar235 #Ukraine #USA #NATO #Biden #Putin 
#UPDATE : Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin urgently wants to begin talks centered on #Russia's security with NATO. #Russia #NATO #Ukraine
Is this for real? It's polarizing They aren't Gods Americans generally hate their politicians for good reason. Stop putting faith in them.   The disaster for Ukrainians is this kind of idealism. It leads to false expectations and removes responsibility. Depend on no one! #Ukraine

"Ukrainian President Volodymyr @zelenskyyua, a native Russian speaker who was elected to lead the Ukraine in 2019, has embarked on a reform drive. However, his popularity seems to have taken a dive. This may have to do with Covid, but also with how hard it is to reform #Ukraine"

@PerceiveRealise And we promised NATO wouldn't expand, and then ran it right up to #Russia's border. That deal with #Ukraine became null and void.

Russia’s President Vladimir #Putin is blackmailing the West on the future of #Ukraine.  “It is time to move forward with the real Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova,” says @KubiliusA, MEP.  Watch and learn more 👇 
@PaulHowellMP Rightly so.  Treat it is palpable. NATO wants Ukraine to resolve Donestk &amp; Lugansk issue not by implementing Minsk agreement but by taking that territory by force.  And Russia is saying: Wait, you can't do so &amp; Ukraine is not going anywhere.  #Ukraine #Russia
#Ukraine's parliament approved on Tuesday a draft law that allows foreign troops to take part in military exercises on the territory of the former #Soviet republic in 2022, a move likely to infuriate #Russia. 
A Russian invasion of Ukraine would be unacceptable but some interesting considerations in Mark’s thread. #ForeignAffairs #Russia #Ukraine

Curious facts about #EU's new #WagnerGroup designations: 1) they are spread across 4 sanctions regimes: #humanrights list (which lists #WagnerGroup as entity), #Libya, #Syria and #Ukraine 2) Double-listing of group founder 3) Total: 8 people + 4 entities

#Putin and #Xi to discuss 'aggressive' talk from #US and #NATO, Kremlin says.    Maybe not in 2021 but looks like early 2022 for war in #Ukraine and #Taiwan - coordinated one-two from the boys in the East will leave the #UnitedStates stretched.

On #TOSOM with @frankmorano: Colonel Douglas MacGregor, Former Senior Advisor to the Secretary of Defense, assesses the readiness of the U.S. military to intervene in the #Ukraine if tensions with Russia continue to escalate there.  Full interview:  
#Russian President Vladimir Putin and his #Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, are scheduled to discuss the tense situation in Europe and NATO's belligerent rhetoric as tensions escalate between #Moscow and Washington over #Ukraine. #BreakingNews 
"Over rest of Europe". #Ukraine IS #Europe. 
#Putin, in a phone call with the #Finnish president, demanded that #NATO stop expanding east and deploying weapons to #Ukraine.   #Russia 
@tonio_walter US and NATO should move troops to Poland that are ready in an emergency.  Putin has to realize that he can no longer cross a certain limit.    Peace is secured with strength and not with appeasement!  #USA #Nato #Ukraine #EU #Germany #France
#Russian President Vladimir #Putin told his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinisto that he wants "immediate" talks with the United States and #NATO over security guarantees, the #Kremlin says, as tensions mount over #Ukraine
Ukrainians sign up for military training as Russia tensions ratchet up   #ReadSelective  #Ukraine #Russia  
#Ukraine says it is planning ten military exercises for next year with the participation of thousands of foreign troops, in yet another move that raises the risk of a military confrontation with #Russia. #BREAKING #nato #USA 
#Russia's 🇷🇺 mobilization of forces to the border with #Ukraine 🇺🇦 has largely been met with words, not action. Check out @emilavdaliani's latest on policy recommendations for preventing a Ukrainian crisis: 
President #Putin gave #UK PM @BorisJohnson specific examples of Kiev's destructive course on derailing #MinskAgreements, which are the only viable path towards resolving internal #Ukraine crisis. 
@abyczewska @KubiliusA Then #Russia would overrun #Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, and no doubt the Baltics and more. And there's not a damn thing we can do about it other than WWIII. Cuban Missile Crisis Principle.
#Ukraine On Dec 8th there was apparently a fascinating remote assassination attempt in #Dnipro, during which an AK-74 was fired from a parked car at the regional council deputy's office before it self-destructed/burst into flames. One man is in custody.  2 pics via @HALLONSA
