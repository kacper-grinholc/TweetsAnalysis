What did MEPs have to say good or bad about #Ukraine? Here's a sentiment analysis wordcloud based on tweets posted in the last month. Explore the tweets at  
Just heard on @ABCWorldNews that #Moscow fuhrer #Putin accused #Ukraine of genocide. What about #Russia’s murder of 7 million Ukrainians in 1932-33? What kind of lies &amp; deceit will #Putin use to deflect attention from his aggression against #Ukraine. #StopRussianAggression
Are there any similarities between #Ukraine and Sudetenland? #Russia #Putin
Sounds like Biden’s Ukraine border strategy is the same as his strategy for the US southern border - Give up and hope the problem goes away. #Ukraine #BorderCrisis

Gen. Kyrylo O. Budanov, chief of #Ukraine’s military intelligence service: “There are not sufficient military resources for repelling a full-scale attack by #Russia if it begins without the support of Western forces.”  Arieli was right.

@FallonTonight @JoeBiden Suggest he enlist @jontaffer to help with #Ukraine negotiations. Once Taffer gets out of his SUV to confront #Putin it’ll be fixed in 3-5 days. USSR Rescue? Border Rescue? War rescue? At the very least, Russia will get a new brand and have more curb appeal.
Looks like #Russia may be gearing up to invade #Ukraine using #Donbas as a plausible excuse. Just look at the change in language recently from #Putin
#Ukraine’s generals give indicators that in an event of an invasion by #Russia, they would have no hope of repelling it without a major infusion of military help from the West.
#Ukraine #Russia  #BUK_M1_2 SAM launchers at #Maslovka. Vehicle numbers have been painted over 
HUGE story - Biden admin reverses US policy on #Ukraine It has been: The US supports Ukraine’s “territorial integrity.” NOW policy is evolving: Hey, Ukraine, forget about that sovereign territory.  It’s #Russia’s now. Big win for #Putin Terrible for our friends, partners &amp; allies 
Well, after the Afghanistan disaster, this would really be the cherry on top for US global credibility. Despite the denials, can’t rule out this was suggested after Kabul. #Russia #Ukraine #NATO 
“If the civilized world wants to avoid catastrophe — and this will be a catastrophe for everyone — we need military technical support now, not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, not in year. Now.” #Ukraine

Zbigniew Brzezinski, in "The Grand Chessboard" (1997): "#Ukraine, a new and important space on the #Eurasian chessboard, is a geopolitical pivot because its very existence as an independent country helps to transform Russia. Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire"
@apmassaro3 It's truly baffling and infuriating, especially when one knows the history of how much #ENEMYruSSia has stolen from #Ukraine over the centuries. The only explanation that makes sense is that Biden and/or his administration, is also compromised, like #tRUMP's was.
Biden Expressed 'Deep Concerns' To Putin Over #Ukraine, #White #House Says - Dec 9 @ 5:54 PM ET

"One senior #Ukraine military official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that if all else failed, the military would simply open its weapons depots and allow the Ukrainian people to take whatever they need to defend themselves and their families." 
Very good and thought provoking thread by @RALee85 on #Russia's options against #Ukraine, and where this crisis is likely to head. This is about compellance rather than invasion per se. His point about long-range fires is important, given that it forces you to ask 'why invade'? 
I imagine President Zelensky of #Ukraine dreams of the day, He can party like #Finland Prime Ministers, without a phone or care or urgency. May Ukraine know that day,when life is free of invasion &amp; war. #NATO

What?! “Admin officials have suggested that the U.S. will press Ukraine to formally cede a measure of autonomy within its eastern Donbas region, which is now under de facto control by Russia-backed separatists who rose up against Kyiv.” #ukraine  
@POTUS just finished a roughly 1 hr 20 min call with #Ukraine President Zelensky.
Controversial trend. The current "peace process" [Minsk + Normandy Four] has been as damaging for #Ukraine (and for #Donbas civilians) as the active fighting was. Would a hypothetical US involvement restart it? Replace it with reason? Or strenghthen #Russia &amp; her vassals in it? 
Instead of threatening #Russia , @POTUS , impose a few now to give #Putin a taste of what could come.  He's already taken a huge step towards an #Invasion .  Time to ask him to pull back in good faith. #Ukraine help.

@Jim_Jordan The few javelins that Congress twisted Trump’s arm to send over were  under stipulation to be held in western #Ukraine, far from the frontline and forbidden to be used unless there was full on invasion, which would’ve been too late. They were just for show. Typical Trump.
