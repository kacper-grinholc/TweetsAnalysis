As expected, #EUCO leaders have warned of "massive consequences" and "severe cost" against #Russia including "restrictive measures coordinated with partners" in the event of any further military aggression towards #Ukraine
Instead of bored rhetoric about mystical ‘dialogue’ with #Russia, #EU must without delay draw up package of meaningful, painful sanctions against arrogant #Russia and put on the table. Sedation will not stop aggression against #Ukraine. Russia must see price of its deeds.
Here the final version of the conclusions on #Ukraine, where EU leaders added “including restrictive measures coordinated with partners”. US is urging EU to put forward a package of sanctions, but the Europeans are seeking to de-escalate the conflict with Putin

#Ukraine #Russia #NATO  #F15 fighter-bombers of the #USAF arrived on December 15 at an air base in Constanta, #Romania, where they will "strengthen their presence" in the Black Sea region together with Italian Eurofighter #Typhoon. 
Another *IF*🙃  Note: same #US which planted "#Russia invasion of #Ukraine" narrative is now pushing #EU to impose sanctions on Russia (preferably pre-emptively) in its *economic* #Warfare to stop #NordStream2 and neutralise a competitor  
A digital marketing agency in #Ukraine deployed a multi-platform operation pursuing #Facebook users willing to rent their accounts out. In exchange for a fee, the marketers exploited the accounts to run ads while mitigating the risk of being de-platformed. 
Imagine if #putin invaded #ukraine simultaneously when #china invades #taiwan . Biden be like

#communism Russia has its troops on the border of Ukraine. They are going to invade #Ukraine  . The Russians sense weakness in the west #freedom . China is watching if we allow Russia to invade the Ukraine #Taiwan  is next . #war For sure
The European Parliament today enacted a resolution at a plenary session calling on the EU to be ready to impose sanctions against Russia in the event of escalation at the Ukrainian border.  #EuropeanUnion  #Ukraine
@ukrmilitary_en The Russian soldiers will be surprised at how brutally and mercilessly the Ukrainian military defends their homeland.  Russian soldiers are forced into a war with which they do not identify, sacrificed for great power fantasies, that will make the difference  #Russia #Ukraine #EU
Today in #Jerusalem  celebrating 30 years of #Israel &amp; #Ukraine diplomatic relations. Mazal Tov ! 
#Germany urged to use #pipeline threat to deter #Russia over #Ukraine #OlafScholz (who replaced Angela Merkel last week) faces calls from some #EU leaders to threaten #Moscow with termination of #NordStream2.  #NATO #Putin
⚡️NATO continues to focus on Ukraine says no threat to Russia 🙈 #ukraine #china #russia #G7 #NATO 
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry Spokesman to Al-Arabiya: Joining NATO and the European Union is a strategic choice. #Ukraine has the option to apply to join #NATO since 2008. #Russia still demands that the promise of joining NATO be removed. 
Interesting tidbit in this @AP story: In Rostov-on-Don, #Russia near border with #Ukraine, court found local businessman "guilty of offering a military officer bribes to procure contracts to supply food to Russian troops deployed to eastern Ukraine." 🤔 
#Russia 💃 #Putin  #Ukraine  #روسيا_اليوم  #أوكرانيا  #China🦠#Taiwan  #الصين 🦠#تايوان   No body gonna expand no where 😉 shortie &amp; biggie da pooh One of you ll be screwed by the other big time…which one of u is the sold out  Well the world shall see🤣  #Bikinsky #Khabarovsk 
Territorial Integrity of #Ukraine is without a question. Need to go beyond. Increasing military build-up of Russia near its borders without any explanations is unacceptable.🇪🇺 needs to coordinate w/🇺🇸 &amp; @NATO. We call for #deescalation &amp; #dialogue but tough #sanctions to be ready
Interesting piece from @CarnegieRussia. #Russia's bloodless (for Russia) seizure of Crimea was popular with Russian public. Fighting in Donbas -- not so much.  How would Russian public react to major war with #Ukraine with significant Russian casualties?  
"#Russia invasion of #Ukraine could ignite World War III". Warning by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense noting that Russian invasion would have far-reaching consequences: "It must be taken into account that it will ignite a global conflict." 
As #underpantspoisoner-#Putin's #cleptocracy has been attacking &amp; occupying parts of peaceful #Ukraine for almost a decade by now &amp; after concessions to Russia it only threathens Ukraine by an open all-out war, this is the only right answer. 
.........Russia prepares the military war, USA the economic one.......to each his own style......  #Russia #UnitedStates #Ukraine 
War Between #Russia and #Ukraine A Basic Scenario  via @YouTube
Russia was the corepower of the evil Empire #SovietUnion before a brutal #Empire, as #RussianFederation from 1992 led 2 terrible wars in #Russia and wars against #Moldova #Ukraine #Georgia and wages wars in several countries #Syria #Libya etc much to say sorry for I guess.

#Ukraine opens up bomb shelters in capital city, Kyiv amid speculation #Russia is gearing up to invade.
#Russia may have no intention of launching a large-scale invasion of #Ukraine despite its recent military buildup, instead aiming to force the #West into political concessions, according to @TheStudyofWar study: 
In The Canada and other Western countries, arrogance &amp; ignorance create potent potion that feeds systemic racism &amp; general feeling of supremacy over non western nations. Millions are dying because of it. #cdnpoli #cdnmedia  #Ukraine  #Russia  #nato  #EU 
This should have always been the goal. #Ukraine 
An awkward moment @MoscowTimes fails to emphasise that what was written in the verdict was only t/*testimony* of t/*defendant* If #Russia had 26K troops would they allow #US-led #Ukraine #Zelensky regime #CreepingOffensive &amp; daily bombardment of Donbass? No #OSCE reports either🙃  
This should have always been the goal #Ukraine.
