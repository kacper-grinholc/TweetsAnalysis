Yeah, right...There are none. Only failures. #Afghanistan #Taliban #oilprice #oilprices #Russian #TAKEOVER #Ukraine #Taiwan #IranDeal #terrorism 
More relevant than Oct 2019‼️  #Ukraine #Butt 
#Ukraine #Azerbaijan bilateral cooperation on economy, agriculture, trade, diplomacy, security, education will create strong bridge for the future generations 
#Moldova #Azerbaijan #Ukraine cooperation will be basic for the strategic relations 
#JoeBiden defense funding bill gives $300 mil to #Ukraine   I bet he didn't ask them for a favor first ...
#EU and #UK warn #Russia it will face tough sanctions if it decides to invade #Ukraine 
We join forces with @EU_Commission to modernise vocational education &amp; training schools in #Ukraine providing valuable works skills for young Ukrainians &amp; improved educational facilities for over 10,000 teachers &amp; students➡️  #EaP #TeamEurope #EU4skills 
In 12th century the land is first mentioned as #Ukraine. #Russia does not exist. Learn more impressive historical facts:  | EMPR 
📍 I would be grateful for any help - Zelensky invited Azerbaijan to help free Ukrainian political prisoners  #Ukraine #Azerbaijan #Zelensky 
This piece by @rogerboyes is excellent. A winter war against #Ukraine will be deeply destructive to #Russia, potentially bogging it down for years. #UK and allied support for Ukraine will make it even harder. Is it not time to call Putin’s bluff? 
#naturalgas in #Europe  rose to $1,400 per 1,000 cubic meters.  #Northsream2 provides the #West with some leverage over #Russia. By delaying its certification until Russia complies with #US-Bloc demands over #Ukraine #Civilwar.   #US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan 
@McFaul Heed the need for #Ukraine to honor the #MinskAgreements, they don't  That is the #issue, @Russia will wipe them clean if they try, the Ukrainian #generals admitted they don't have a chance  Funny you'd miss this "#Logic"  #sanctions as #foreign #policy is a loser ... bigtime

The difference between farce and real drama? Compare the Ukrainian kerfuffle over an unproven "coup d'etat" and reports about Dresden police probe into anti-vacciners' plot to kill Saxony's governor over #COVID19 restrictions. #PoliticsLive #Ukraine   
Russia edges closer to war as new arms arrive on Ukraine’s border. If #Putin's intention is not war, it is definitely intimidation &amp; bullying. Both are unacceptable. Neither #Ukraine nor the West are threatening #Russia &gt;&gt;    @MaximEristavi @BenWeinthal
#Propaganda works;#Putin knows it. His moles use it in #US, #EU:everywhere. He means 2 win.    Turn the tables:punish #Russia with #SWIFT, freezing assetS IN #west, #UKraine in #NATO membership. No  idle threats, #POTUS;do it or #Putin's "predictability" will harm ALL democracies 
With no direct talks in sight, #Ukraine is bracing itself for an escalation in the next few months.

🇬🇧|#Brussels threatens #Russia "with unprecedented measures" over fears of a Russian invasion of #Ukraine. The #EU wants to expand existing #sanctions. Diplomacy is a foreign word for these technocrats! #ID 
Yuliia Laputina, the minister for veterans affairs - who previously served as a top officer in Ukraine's equivalent of MI5 - told Sky News that her country was ready to defend itself should Moscow launch a new attack #ukraine #Russia #YuliiaLaputina #WW3
#EU countries oppose plans to introduce new sanctions against #Russia because of #Ukraine, #France and #Germany prefer negotiations - Bloomberg

@_hudsonc @declanwalsh #US invades #Russia , just because it did military drills with #Ukraine 👇
Security experts warn that #Ukraine is radicalizing far-right foreign fighters in the same way as #Syria has with Islamist extremists, creating an international network of combat-trained extremists.  ⬇️   
France, Germany and Ukraine seek fresh peace talks with Russia  by @rdfemmott + @sasilink #Germany #France #Ukraine #summit #Russia
„talking to Moscow…” #Ukraine  
Tensions are flaring in #Ukraine once again - we take this opportunity to stress the obligation to uphold education, even in times of conflict. More information contained in our monitoring guide on education under attack:    #ProtectEducation 
Ukraine does not need the EU's "understanding". For the sake of European security, #Ukraine needs a joint deterrence and common resolute action!
