@ABarbashin Dear @ABarbashin, excellent thread here. Retired CIA officer @glcarle &amp; I have penned something on #VladimirPutin's long game. Is it just #Ukraine or does he have sights on more?

When the Trees fall, Maryzia Nikitiuk, #Ukraine #Poland  #NorthMacedonia 2018 🤯@Arte_Kino 
I fully understand #Putins concerns, the liberal #EU is a deep danger to all not only to #Russia but #Europe it self.. Invasion of #Ukraine is not the solution.. nor expansion of #Nato, but a serious step to full world war, where no one is the winner .. 
@MSnegovaya NATO has no desire to fight with, or invade, #Russia, why would the #Ukraine joining #NATO be a risk? The only ONE INVADING has been Russia, who annexed Ukraine, after white anting support for Ukrainian Government, slipping 'little green men' without identification in to attack.
BREAKING! HUGE WARNING FROM RUSSIA TO NATO   via @YouTube #NATO #Russia #Ukraine #Biden #Putin #US #Sweden #Finland
Russia considers military action if NATO doesn’t meet its demands.   NATO once floated the idea of a ‘fast track’ membership for Ukraine.   #Russia 🇷🇺 #Ukraine 🇺🇦 #NATO  #WW3 
How is the situation between #Russia versus #Ukraine and #NATO ?

Georgraphy matters: the image of "#Russia'n forces NEAR #Ukraine" shows Pogonovo Training Area outside of Voronezh. It's about 390 km (240+ miles) to UKR border.  Austin, TX is some 200 miles from border w/ Mexico. Is it considered "at the border"?  
So @VP will talk about possible sanctions against #Putin if he invaded #Ukraine but is absolutely silent on the #nordstream2 ?

The #US has conducted two failed wars, in #Afghanistan and #Iraq, over the past 20 years and that many Americans have no interest in fighting another faraway conflict in #Ukraine with a fuzzy connection to national security. Especially when the conflict is the result of a coup.
Despite the #UK’s claims of "unwavering support to Ukraine," reports say that #British troops are ready to pull out from #Ukraine 'in case of a #Russian invasion.'
Clearly, something of a PR offensive is underway, censuring #Germany for not yet doing enough for #Ukraine and facilitate its  NATO ambitions , and confronting Russia it is no surprise that German fm Baerbock has already warned that Nord Stream 2 cannot be certified – !

Training Civilians, #Ukraine 🇺🇦 Nurtures a Resistance in Waiting.  European nations have drawn a lesson from America’s wars of the last decades: Insurgency works. Ukraine’s training of volunteers has become a factor in the crisis with #Russia.  #SundayRead 
Unlike the 2014 annexation of Crimea, #Russia 🇷🇺's saber-rattling in #Ukraine 🇺🇦 has not resulted in a rise in anti-American sentiments 
Here’s a guy making ridiculous demands so he can support an invasion.    Not Unlike last time he’ll attack during the Olympics which provides a useful distraction.    #Crimea #Ukraine #Putin 
Silent night, holy night...#Ukraine 
Polish TV @tvp_info picked up my speech regarding the Russian military threat on the Eastern border of #Ukraine #dontappeasethebully 
Meanwhile in #Ukraine  #European effect !!! 
Thousands of 🇷🇺#Russian 🪖 military are reportedly returning to their "permanent deployment points" from field training on the #border with neighboring 🇺🇦#Ukraine. 
#Putin said today he would ponder options if the West fails to meet his demand guarantees precluding @NATO’s expansion to #Ukraine. He said #Russia's response “it could be diverse,” &amp; “it will depend on what proposals our military experts submit to me.”

"The head of the domestic intelligence agency, Ivan Bakanov, had been the director of the Kvartal 95 [comedy] studio. A chief presidential adviser, Serhiy Shefir, was a screenwriter and producer"  #ukraine #democracy #corruption
America &amp; its allies did nothing to thwart the Russian rape of Crimea in 2014. They must do so this time. Especially after the Afghanistan debacle, it is urgent that the free world defend #Ukraine's sovereignty and force Putin to back down.  My new column:

Russia announces withdrawal of 10,000 troops after drills near Ukraine...  #russia #announces #withdrawal #of # #troops #after #drills #near #ukraine
Paranoia with access to nukes is not so good combination. But this is most likely only to deter intervening completion of occupation of #Ukraine, nothing else.   #Russia #Putin

🇷🇺#Russia denied that it was planning to #invade 🇺🇦#Ukraine.
The United States and the #G7 warned #Russia that there will be massive consequences for pursuing any further military aggression against #Ukraine. 
"The Ukrainian Question". #Ukraine #Historyv FYI @BBCWorld @RFERL @SkyNews @JEyal_RUSI @BritishArmy 
#Putin sent a message to #America   "You won't get #Ukraine"  A message from #Russian Federation to #Americans for #Christmas in form of a light projection at #American Embassy in #Moscow appeared on Dec 25 exactly on 30th anniversary of collapse of #USSR
MOSCOW, December 26. / TASS /. Moscow has received a proposal from the NATO to convene the #Russia-#NATO Council (NRC) on January 12, 2022 and is considering it, the Russian Foreign Ministry told TASS on Sunday. #Ukraine #Putin 
Very good timeline of situation in #Ukraine 
Why should America line up our soldiers on any ones border? Don't you think that, that would be provocation? Doing nothing is allowing #Putin to dictate the circumstance. Arm #Ukraine and allow them to defend themselves. 
#Russia #Ukraine   Thousands of Russian troops are withdrawing from the Ukrainian border after conducting drills for a month.  "more than 10,000 Russian troops were leaving a number of regions near Ukraine — including Crimea, Rostov and Kuban — and returning to permanent bases." 
@MarkSeddon1962 Absurd statement. Vladimir Putin invaded #Ukraine in 2014. He annexed #Crimea and fermented war in the Donbas...
“The #US administration must increase supplies of defensive weapons, including lethal weapons, to #Ukraine to strengthen the defense capabilities of the #Ukrainian Armed Forces amid #Russian aggression says #US senator, Rob Portman.”
