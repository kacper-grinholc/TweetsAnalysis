WHO GIVES ONE DAMN ABOUT YOUR UPCOMING VIDEO CALL WITH THE EVIL PUTIN?   Get our troops over to #Ukraine, post haste.  Monitoring the situation ONLY means hand-wringing after the fact, to the Ukrainians' detriment, from YOUR procrastinating negligence!   @POTUS @JoeBiden @NATO
[1-hour ago] @PressSec is confirming a call is expected between @POTUS and #Russia's President Putin "on #strategicstability, cyber, and regional issues" including activity on the border with #Ukraine. 
@NikaMelkozerova from fellow #Russians, bombing #Chechnia, and killing those who reported about it.  The higher the price, the longer appeasement is continued.  So, helping #Ukraine now in all possible ways including military, is the first step.
#Russia, LEAVE #Ukraine ALONE!   BUNCH OF DERANGED LUNATICS STARTING WITH #VladimirPutin!   #Putin, YOU ARE A #FRUITCAKE!   I AM WITH #UKRAINE and the #Ukrainian people 100%!
Dear #Kremlin #Putin, Referenda are really in vogue right now, so before you go ahead and wage war against #Ukraine, you may wish to ask them if they‚Äôd like to be a part of #Russia. If you deploy the same tactics you did during Brexit, you might win. Regards, a tired world.

#Biden, #Putin Set Video Call Tuesday as #Ukraine Tensions Grow | 41 mins ago - Putin will come to the call with concerns of his own and intends to express Russia's opposition to any move to admit Ukraine into the #NATO military alliance
‚Äú#Putin cannot help but notice that many top officials on the #Biden team were senior Obama administration officials when the US government discouraged #Ukraine from resisting Russia‚Äôs invasion of Crimea in 2014.‚Äù

And that by helping #Ukraine NOW here, and in every ways, will reduce the price in the future compared to appeasement which only empowers such actors.  #Russia could do as #Ukraine, and we better be prepared to help them, too.
True or not, it's something small like this that #Putin would or could use to justify some degree of military action/response from #Russia toward #Ukraine  #US #NATO #EU #Belarus
The planned talks come after Kyiv has warned Russia could invade next month. #Ukraine  
@AngieSkys HEADLINE: Biden warns Putin he will make it 'very, very difficult' to attack #Ukraine.  But is #Russia planning to invade? No, because the Russian military is based on defense &amp; avoiding war as long as possible. If provoked, however, Russia will finish the war.
‚ÄúIf made operational, this pipeline would enable the Kremlin to use gas for political purposes by withholding it from countries in east Europe that pursue policies it does not like, and make it easier for Moscow to expand its current war of aggression in #Ukraine.‚Äù

When we think of Ukraine we should think about what Putin does not want. And one thing he does not want is the U.S. missile defense system Aegis Ashore in Romania - and ultimately Poland. So he is looking to get concessions from U.S. in arms control talks. #Ukraine

Russian separatist forces have received pay increase and have been sent on training. Previous reports stated separatist forces have problem retaining fighters as many are leaving fearing the onset of rmed conflict with with #ukraine 
Where is Zelensky in all of this? #Ukraine   The optics of a Ukrainian president nowhere to be seen. To speak on behalf of Ukrainian's to the world.  While Russia and its mouthpieces fill the air with fear and disinformation.  The opportunities that are wasted on a daily basis.üò° 
@Mortis_Banned No thx. This is live now. We‚Äôre watching. #Ukraine üá∫üá∏üá∫üá¶ 
I have a feeling that before #Putin dies his goal will be to rebuild the #SovietUnion And he‚Äôs starting with #Ukraine With a pandemic and a weak American president he might make his move soon. I don‚Äôt think Putin ever got over the betrayal and the fall of the former Soviet Union
Why #Putin warned #NATO: We can send missiles in 10 minutes  #Ukraine #USA #conflict   via @tweetasmpk
@OlgaNYC1211 @uamuzik Instead of worrying about their own country, improving the welfare of its citizens, the administration of the glorious Russian world thinks 24 hours a day, 365 days a year about where and how to wage war with Ukraine.  #Russia #Ukraine #USA #Nato #Germany #France #EU
@OlgaNYC1211 God bless #Ukraine
@POTUS #BBB is just a #trademark of Klaus Schwab, #Ukraine of Putin. Take that. And this 
#NATO should immediate admit #Ukraine as a member state
#US @SecBlinken  and #Russian Foreign Minister Sergei #Lavrov had a testy exchange over #Ukraine at a dinner with dozens of their colleagues this week, sources say  via @bpolitics
So our only option is a bargain which preserves Ukraine‚Äôs independence, keeps the US out of a war, and makes it so Russia feels less cornered.  A grand bargain:   #Ukraine #russia #nato
The State Border Guard Service of Ukraine  rebutted the claim of Minsk that there was an airspace violation by #Ukraine  
Earlier this week, Min. Joly met w #Netherlands‚Äô @ministerBZ at #OSCEMC2021.

#Russia arrests #CrimeanTatar leader Nariman #Dzhelyal in revenge for #CrimeaPlatform and holds him in a damp cell without heating  #FreeNarimanDzhelyal #LetMyPeopleGo #Ukraine   
@gpovanman @GuyWDavis @Andre_1917 @GlasnostGone @OnlyWongs @us_ignorance Since when did the west care about  the rules? West  have blatantly disregarded international law any time that suits them. West should stop dreaming about taking Donestk &amp; Luganstk by force &amp; make sure Ukraine implement Minsk agreement. #Russia #Ukraine
@VoteDarlene @RexChapman I think it's normal for Orthodox Christians.  Have seen the pictures. 2011. Small towns in #Ukraine. Znamenka I specifically remember. Have a pic... Somewhere... But also, Google:

Excellent piece by @IanBrzezinski ; @NATO should signal resolve to #Putin on his military build up on #Ukraine border.   Economic &amp; diplomatic #sanctions yes, but also strengthen #NATO force posture &amp; keep option of use of force on the table!  @NATOSource 
Thank You @SecBlinken  #Ukraine 
It‚Äôs deeply concerning that Russia‚Äôs foreign ministry spokeswoman relayed the idea that Ukraine and Georgia are not sovereign countries #Ukraine #Georgia 
#UKRAINE üá∫üá¶  Shelling can be heard in #Horlivka
Why #Russia will not invade #Ukraine 
An unclassified #US intelligence document details some of the #intelligence findings, including the positioning of what officials say could eventually be 100 battalion tactical groups, as well as heavy armour, artillery and other equipment. #Russia #Ukraine #Putin #Biden #Donbass
The #Biden admin‚Äôs growing alarm about a potential #Russian invasion of #Ukraine is based in part on #US #intelligence that #Moscow has drawn up plans for a military offensive involving an estimated 175,000 troops as soon as early next year. #Putin
