M/while, #Ukraine Prosecutor Gen. Venediktova says there are "200 various investigations underway" concerning businesses of  Rinat Akhmetov - the oligarch accused by President Zelensky of "being dragged into a coup d'etat". She CLEARLY hinted it's her office's political reaction.
The US and #NATO make aggressive moves in #Ukraine. The '#Russian threat' is designed to justify NATO moving further to the east after the #USA abrogated a peace agreement established by #Reagan and #Gorbachev. Some say the US wants a subservient #Russia, akin to a vassal state.  
While #Moscow squawks about mythical NATO encirclement, #Russia is in fact militarily encircling #Ukraine. 
I'm sure #Lavrov is aware #Ukraine is trying to provoke a war and @jensstoltenberg can fast track it into @NATO as @vonderleyen will do for #EU membership and claim #Putin is attacking EU &amp; NATO ..a very dangerous game #VolodymyrZelensky!
Can anyone tell me why the EU is choosing to support one non-EU member, #ukraine against another non-EU member, Russia?
Goodnight #Ukraine part two. Stay safe orc watchers. 
Ambassador Daniel Fried: "Putin talks about guarantees of no-NATO membership for #Georgia and #Ukraine, but that is not what this is really about. This is about Putin's desire to destroy the independence of these countries and have them subordinate satellites to #Moscow. #Russia
“#Moscow is so positioned that they can move w/very little warning,” John Herbst, former U.S. ambassador to #Ukraine, now a director at the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan think tank. “They’re certainly threatening. &amp; they’re in a position that if they want to, they can do it.”

I believe that if Putin will order #Russian ground Forces to further its occupation of #Ukraine to all out War. #Putin will order Air and sea strikes like German blitzkrieg "shock tactics" style war. hard and fast Just as #NATO used in Iraq. Its coming, just question of when?
@EndGameWW3 @newshound2013uk  #Belarus #BelarusBorder #Ukraine #China #Taiwan #NorthKorea So geopolitical friends, I have a question for you.  What are the odds (in your opinion) the Eastern European Crisis turns "hot" in some capacity?
#Russia’s activity on the #Ukraine border has put the West on the edge of a Very #HotWar 🔥 
During the Summit for Democracy, Speaker of the 🇺🇦 Parliament @r_stefanchuk emphasized, that #Ukraine will defend its people and its democratic values. According to him, democracies around the world needed to come together to #B3W.

#Write4Rights: Sphere NGO is one of the oldest #LGBTI &amp; women’s rights NGOs in #Ukraine. Sphere has been attacked almost 30 times since 2017, leaving the organization &amp; supporters in constant fear. Call on @MVS_UA to protect Sphere NGO #W4R21 &gt;&gt;&gt; 
@SecBlinken @GlasnostGone Appeasement interprets Russia as weakness and is an invitation for military action.  If you want to impress Russia you have to move 2 armored divisions to Poland that could intervene quickly.  If you want to save peace then only through strength.  #USA #Biden #Nato #EU #Ukraine
Did you know that #Vinnytsia is considered to be the most liveable city in #Ukraine? Our feature in 🇩🇪German:  and in 🇺🇦Ukrainian:

U.S. warns #Russia as #Kremlin talks about war threat in #Ukraine  
There is lots of talk on #Russia's possible (but unlikely?!) invasion of #Ukraine vs #NATO is getting closer to Russian borders. In fact, this is all about the imminent crash of the European security. Will anyone pick the broken pieces to put them together?
Valuable insights from @mikko_kinnunen, @ICRC_ua and @OSCE_SMM at today’s #OSCEMC2021 event on the dire humanitarian impact for civilians of the drastic freedom of movement restrictions in eastern #Ukraine. Many thanks to @DmytroKuleba and all other participants. #OSCE2021SWE 
US warns #Russia as Kremlin talks about war threat in #Ukraine 
@WesClarkjr @BusinessInsider The #Russians prepositioned equipment for 100,000 troops  (mercenaries) on #Crimea Border w/ #Ukraine. Russians &amp; #Belarus military exercises on #BelarusBorder right now!  #Putin risks @NATO &amp; #EU response. Putin destabilizes area. Move planes, ammo, maintenance into #Ukraine NOW
Well argumented article by @melindaharing. Plain &amp; simple, #Kremlin has no business in #Ukraine. Russia should mind its own business or mind consequences.  via @ForeignAffairs
U.S. Secretary of State #AntonyBlinken urged #Russia to “de-escalate” on #Ukraine and use “diplomacy”, reiterating his threat of “serious consequences” if Russia resorts to “aggression”. 
I know all the people on here horny for war porn are convinced Russia is going to take some aggressive action...I'm not convinced.   Any overt aggression carries huge risks with limited benefits, from Putin's perspective. This could just be posturing. #Ukraine 
Opening of the new and innovative #SocialServices Center in #Bakhmut in eastern #Ukraine with Phillipe Cori @UNICEF_ECA is excellent example of partnership between UNICEF &amp; municipality to help #families &amp; #children with the generous support of German Government #TogetherWeCan 
@UN The trench tells you lot more than words ; #Russia will not back off over #Ukraine .

Terrorist Attack Thwarted in Russia, 3 Ukrainian Spies Arrested -  #ukraine #russia #putin #vladimirputin #biden 
Putin wants to vassalize Ukraine. His kleptocratic regime cannot stand the idea of a free, democratic, and independent #Ukraine, charting its own way in international politics. It’s incumbent on us to stand with Ukrainians. @MLInstitute @CanadianPM  
If #Russia invades #Ukraine, #Biden will order #BaskinRobbins to close half its branches in #Moscow!
Important event @ #OSCEMC2021 focusing on increasing restrictions to civilian freedom of movement along the line of contact in #Ukraine  @OSCE_SMM thematic report is an important contribution   Further steps are needed to ensure that citizens can exercise their #HumanRights.

.@SecBlinken needs to tell the comedian in #Ukraine to shut up before he gets us into a confrontation with #Russia.

Given Russia's military buildup, @BalkanDevlen warns that the vassalization of #Ukraine may be Putin's ultimate goal. "The West should aim to significantly increase the cost of invasion for #Russia if we want to avoid war in Europe." #cdnpoli
