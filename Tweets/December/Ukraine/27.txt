Russian FM: Security Talks With US to Start Immediately After Russian Holidays Russia's new year holiday season lasts through January 9 by Dave DeCamp @DecampDave #Russia #diplomacy #Ukraine #NATO   
Pope expresses hope there won't be conflict in #Ukraine:  “#PopeFrancis during his Christmas speech urged not to allow a conflict in #Ukraine and expressed hope that in order to fulfill this goal, the parties will be able to establish a dialogue.”
What #Putin wants out of the January "negotiations" is another Munich Conference. Appeasement of Putin's Russia is only surrender of Eastern #Europe.  #Ukraine #NATO

To those in hysteria about alleged Russian invasion of the Ukraine or #Russia’s war with #Ukraine. There won’t be any war with Ukraine. Period. Thank President Putin because he is considering the people of Ukraine as our relatives not the puppets in #Kiev but actual people.
#Ukraine's authoritarian US client regime is arresting all challengers to NATO-backed dictatorial President Zelensky  After locking up the main opposition leader and closing critical media, he now even seeks to arrest former US puppet President Poroshenko
Good. U.S. still needs to do more such as push for #Ukraine to be part of #NATO. 
Europe and the United States left #Ukraine in the lurch. But they can and should be at Kyiv's side now. Appeasement of the Kremlin would have disastrous consequences -for the whole of Europe, not just Ukraine. [Getty Images] via

NOTE #NATO, a defensive organisation, has structural difficulties which would make it difficult, to impossible, to invade #Russia (not that anyone has a desire to); Russia, on the other hand, has a history of invasion (#Poland, #Sweden, 1939). Most recently #Ukraine&gt;&gt; aggressor.

@im_PULSE @democracynow You have quite a warped perception and even more skewed deduction to think that I'm arguing for #Russia to terrorise #Ukraine! Seriously doubt #NATO would go to war over #Ukraine, so calm down and don't get your knickers in a twist.
@GicAriana #Putin himself admitted that he was testing his newest #Russian arms on bodies &amp; homes of #Syria’s people. Our country is in ruins &amp; our national assets owned &amp; our land occupied by this #warcriminal. He was not stopped over our mass graves, so he now moves on to kill #Ukraine
  Wild Field Sniper School in #Ukraine started in 2014 with one site, near the City of Dnipro. As the video shows, they've since expanded. The Western press thinks this is a recent development - NOT!
#Pripyat, #Ukraine was the city most affected by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986.  
#Russia-#Ukraine crisis escalates; Kiev army shells East 
#RamzanKadyrov: "If #Zelensky continues his anti-Russian policy, then #Ukraine must be annexed to #Russia."  "If I had been instructed, I would have solved this issue long ago," the #Chechen leader explained. #Kadirov might be the next leader of #Turkey.After 😂 will come the 😭 
A disgusting and perhaps foreshadowing of events to unfold. #Ukraine 
In my latest article for @ForeignPolicy, I discuss the signposts to watch for #Russia's potential invasion of #Ukraine, and why it's unlikely to happen in the immediate future    Past attacks suggest Moscow probably won’t move on Ukraine. 
“#Ukraine may strike #Russia first at West's behest – MP — RT Russia &amp; Former Soviet Union” Not difficult to see what’s going on here, preparing their excuses.
Total size of armies, latest data on Wiki 2.300 million #usa 1.200 million #Ukraine 3.500 million #Russia  7 million #NorthKorea  375. 000 #France  213.000 #Germany  #Army. It's just for my curiosity. Obviously quantity isn't quality. 
🔴 Our guests from #Chile, #Poland, &amp; #Ukraine, will discuss their experience of participating in the conf. #GlobalCrisis &amp; how important it is to communicate to the public the true causes of #ClimateChange, and the importance of building #CreativeSociety. 
@JulianRoepcke @usairforce I'm not glad at the fact, but I'm glad you call it "Russian-occupied territory in eastern #Ukraine."  Thanks!

@McFaul @JimGoldgeier It's impossible to negotiate in good faith with ruSSian terrorists &amp; sociopathic murderers like #putin &amp; his regime. They will ALWAYS break their word, i.e., the #BudapestMemorandum pledge not to violate #Ukraine territory &amp; sovereignty.

100,000-130,000 Russian troops on the #Ukraine border.  Appeasement didn't work in 1938. Somehow the international community to some degree accepted the illegal annexation of #Crimea almost 8 years ago. Let's not make Ukraine into a new Czechoslovakia. 
As the #crisis in #Ukraine escalates, people in East Ukraine’s breakaway republics continue living under constant threat of #shelling from #Kiev armed forces, despite a ceasefire agreement. We discuss this and more next on IQ.  #InQuestion @ManilaChan    
My research also suggests that insurgency in case of #Russia - #Ukraine war is likely to involve far right &amp; their paramilitary branches. Radical nationalist &amp; neo-Nazi organizations &amp; activists were involved in Maidan massacre of police &amp; protesters.

The only choice was ever to help Ukraine fight "It was the #Kremlin that set these terms, not #Ukraine. And for almost 8 years, Ukrainians have carried the burden of meeting face to face the Kremlin’s challenge to the West." #uspoli #cdnpoli 
A former Republican President and his corrupt Cabinet members had a fundamental duty to protect the peaceful transfer of power, our elected officials, the Constitution of the United States, and our democracy.   You failed, Mike.  #Jan6Insurrection #Ukraine  #Covid19

@NavantiGroup @NATO If the US do not even consider #Russia's request for #Ukraine not to join #NATO then I expect this meeting will not happen and heighten activity on the border
Several folks have asked me why foreign policy issues don’t fall neatly along partisan lines.   Following my friend @SahilBloom’s approach, I’ve attempted to demystify these divisions by trying to explain them to a 5-year-old. 🧵#Ukraine #Russia #China #Iran #Afghanistan #Taiwan

#Biden previously warned #Russia 🇷🇺 of strong measures if tensions with #Ukraine 🇺🇦 escalate. The signing of the 2022 Defense Budget does sanction #nordstream2, which would have been an opportunity to show #US willingness to uphold its claims  
Moscow has put forth in response to Western alarm over a RU troop build-up near #Ukraine are a clear sign that RU is "trying to create a pretext for war," making an assault possible ASA in Jan.  US has pushed Germany to stop #NordStream2 if an invasion.  #UkraineConflict #Donbas 
(1/2) Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov announced that talks between the #USA and #Russia would take place on 07 January 2022. The meeting comes amid growing tensions related to the Russian build-up along the #Ukraine border.
Wonder what the "Turkey is in bed with Russia" folks have to say about this. #Turkey #Russia #Ukraine 
"...the leadership is being pushed into it “very strongly by the West,” and the country is now in a situation of “absolute hopelessness.”   #Ukraine #Russia #Putin #NATO #EU #JoeBiden 
@RealBristolNews #Ukraine obviously #Bosnia is targeted, the Baltics and  - any domestic dissent will be crushed by murder. But #Ukraine alone could plunge Russia into chaos- it is a multi national/ethnic entity and could fracture-

@BenjaminNorton First #Tymoshenko and now #Poroshenko. #Treason seems to be the favorite form of revenge for #Ukraine politicians.
@NavantiGroup @NATO Expect more strident warmongering and lying from #Russia leading up to the summit. Their playbook dating to Khrushchev calls for it. This time is exceptionally dangerous for miscalculation and/or false flag.   #Ukraine
.@thehill is such trash. #politics #Russia #Ukraine 
@ConflictCenter I support #Ukraine 100%, but women are the life of any country. I encourage the government to change its position on this.
I really want #Johnson gone but a war in Europe is a clear and present danger and the UK is being very parochial- nothing from @UKLabour except for the pro Kremlin wing of the party - very happy to be proved wrong if Starmer has made a clear statement of support for #Ukraine

As the threat of conflict with #Russia 🇷🇺 continues, #Ukraine 🇺🇦 has started to require women, including pregnant women and those with young children, to register with the military. Ukraine specifies that it is 'registration' and not 'conscription'

⭕️Very interesting article from Military Watch magazine ⬇️ 👉”Air Superiority Over Kiev: Can 🇷🇺#Russia|n Strike Fighters Eliminate 🇺🇦#Ukraine’s Air Defences Within 24 Hours?”  
Those trying to understand the #Ukraine crisis might benefit from Jack Matlock's insights. Matlock is a former US ambassador and a confidant of Reagan and Gorbachev. He might know something insta analysis gods don't. Especially recommended for journalists.
