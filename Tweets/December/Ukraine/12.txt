I mean, the Embassy is correct; “eventual Russian aggression against #Ukraine” is a bogus slogan.  Renewed or continuous aggression is more accurate.

An expert on #Russia and #Ukraine explained to me one reason why #Putin is wary of invading. He doesn’t fear the Ukraine army, but private citizens who took vast stocks of smaller weapons and control of their manufacture after the fall of the USSR. “It’d be street-by-street.”
Putin's remarks about Ukraine this year show that he will ultimately accept nothing but the return of Russian-influenced Kyiv, which at least means ending the pro-Western Zelensky government and cutting off US support for Ukraine. #Ukraine #Putin #G7

As expected, #Baerbock the minister speaks differently from Baerbock the campaigner. With regards to #China, cooperation is priority. On #Russia/#Ukraine, negotiations are needed. And #NordStream2 is not framed as a political/ecological no-go, but a legalistic (regulatory) issue.

@RALee85 Spot on. Adding to that, #Russia likely learned a somewhat similar lesson in #Ukraine in 13-14. While there were far greater sanctions imposed by the west than in 08, there was no military confrontation with the west whatsoever as a result of Russian activity in Crimea/Donbass.
#Russia presently has at least 70,000 troops stationed at its border with #Ukraine, and that number is steadily growing.  How much sway does the US and @NATO really have to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine?
