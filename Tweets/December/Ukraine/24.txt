#Russian Consulate in #Ukraine attacked with Molotov Cocktail.  #Russia has called an attack on its Consulate General in #Lviv a #terrorist act - and a consequence of hysteria and Russophobia in Ukraine. 
There is precisely zero justification for Russia/Putin to invade #Ukraine. Ukraine is a sovereign state and any military action against it would be a disgrace and utterly immoral.
I wonder if these real-time warnings would include intelligence on Russian aircraft movements. I imagine the initial stages of any renewed invasion would involve a significant amount of airpower on the part of #Russia for a targeted bombing campaign against #Ukraine.
The U.S. is considering providing #Ukraine with real-time intelligence of an imminent #Russian invasion in the event #Russia's forces are seen moving towards the #Ukrainian border.
