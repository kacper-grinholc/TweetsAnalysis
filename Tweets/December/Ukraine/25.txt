@DavidLarter Why didnt @SkyNews ask #Putin why #Russia invaded #Ukraine twice in 2014 &amp; now threatens 3rd invasion after it had guaranteed to Ukraine (the Budapest Memorandum) that it would respect its sovereignty &amp; territorial integrity (ie not invade) if Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons?
Zelensky, U.S. senators, congressmen discuss support for #Ukraine 
I understand the concept of OPSEC but can any one confirm this. #Russia #Ukraine #UkraineWillResist
#Ukraine/#UkraineConflict info, from #Navalny's Youtube channel: 
@cnni I hope #Biden's administration realizes that #US no longer can bully #Russia or threaten Russia with force. If Russia decides to really invade Ukraine, Biden will learn it from the news not from Kremlin. No rational American would take arms to fight for #Ukraine. That's for sure
#Russia's deployment of tens of thousands of troops to the north, east and south of #Ukraine had fueled fears in Kyiv and Western capitals that Moscow was planning an attack.
