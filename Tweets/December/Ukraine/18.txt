I've said Budapest Memo was not legally-binding treaty (would need Senate consent to ratification).  Never said it was just sheet of paper. Memo signed by 3 presidents, including #Russia's, &amp; 1 PM. That gave it meaning, at least for US, UK &amp; #Ukraine.  Pay attention in future. 
@BBCWorld Wise decision. #Ukraine
@neilclevine @WSJopinion My post on #Putin vs #Ukraine, with which many may disagree strongly--but all depends on "if Putin is serious about wanting to make a real deal and not just looking for an excuse to quash Ukraine and put it under de facto Russian control" 
The two RUS treaty proposals were clearly drafted with full awareness that they are riddled with unacceptable conditions. Negotiations w/@NATO (should they happen) are likely intended by Moscow as cover/excuse for military action in #Ukraine. @JJCarafano @RebHarms @SlawomirDebski

#Russia continues to expand military presence near #Ukraine border via. @DFRLab 
#NATO and the #US, that's who.  Who is to blame for the #Ukraine crisis? 
Thread: There's a middle ground between sending US troops to #Ukraine and doing nothing. 1. US should impose preemptive #sanctions on #Russia's entities &amp; individuals (up to SWIFT) 2. US should release military aid to #Ukraine. 3. #Biden should pressure Putin, not Zelensky. 
The “new” level of cooperation between Russia &amp; China has likely developed because Russia wants the #Ukraine &amp; China wants #Taiwan. Both #Putin &amp; #Xi perceive weakness in the US &amp; believe the US will do little to stop them if they coordinate action.

Goodnight #Ukraine until the morrow. 
...against the likely escalation of #Russia's ongoing since 2014 armed aggression against #Ukraine.  We must pay tribute to these honest and courageous people, as the whole world paid tribute to the 8 heroes who came to Red Square in Moscow in Aug. 1968...⤵️
These 5 people today tried to save #Russia's honour (long lost) &amp; Russia itself (because an overt war with #Ukraine would be the end of Russia).  5 people in the Russian city of Kirov, five for  all of Russia,  came out to protest...⤵️ 
I guess the Americans will refuse this, because the issue could jeopardize the negotiations with Putin and thus also threaten the role of the United States in NATO. #Russia #Ukraine #US #NATO
In light of the tensions at its border, Ukraine has asked the US with to place Patriot systems in its territory. The assumption in Ukrainian intelligence that missiles of various types will arrive in the form of aerial bombardments and using heavy artillery. #Russia #Ukraine #US

So Putin is basically just throwing his weight around because his favourite toy Trump got taken away, and NATO don’t want to play with him either?   Or do you think he’s seriously considering invading #Ukraine?

Where there is a will, there's a way. In this case, #Russia, #Ukraine, tough. More, #KlarasWar, the sequel to #KlarasJourney. Both historical novels  Wherever books are sold. #WW2, #Kiev, #Moscow. #Donbas. #Odessa.
It makes no difference. #Putin will invade #Ukraine regardless to bring back the #USSR glory days. We need #NATO force build up in Ukraine now. If we stand for sovereignty and freedom, we must counter #Putin's demands and play chess better.
#Ukraine faces heating cuts as fuel crisis worsens – media  Several regions of Ukraine are facing heating cuts due to critically low fuel reserves at thermal power plants, the Kiev-based weekly newspaper #ZerkaloNedeli claimed on Thursday
#NATO's top general has suggested the alliance should establish a military presence in #Bulgaria and #Romania following #Russia's troop build-up near the border with #Ukraine, German newspaper @DerSpiegel reported on Saturday
key questions: 1. does it amount to #Russia acceptance of present @Nato borders? yes. 2. would it mean #Ukraine at peace w/in present borders, no #Russia on ground interference? yes. aren't those worth having?  verify - of course, but you have to trust, too. 
A warning with regard to #Ukraine, I don’t doubt 
What issues aren't getting much or any coverage at the moment? The Maxwell trial or the impending War with Russia? If you know of neither then I advise you to research the latter. #WarWithRussia #WW3 #War #Ukraine
@fhsdkjhfqwqwe @UkrEmbLondon @UKRinUN @UKRintheUSA @Ukraine @PromoteUkraine @ZelenskyyUa I know states like to play a diplomatic game in the name of realpolitik. But #Ukraine can't stress the importance of international law in Crimea - then act as if illegal annexation doesn't matter in Israel/Palestine  @MelnykAndrij @Mariana_Betsa @DmytroKuleba @EmineDzheppar

BREAKING NEWS: NATO general wants alliance troops in Bulgaria, Romania – Der Spiegel  #alliance #Bulgaria #nato #Romania #Russia #TodWolters #Ukraine
#UnitedStates - #Ukraine: The US is reportedly considering a plan to send helicopters and other military equipment previously designated for the military of #Afghanistan to Ukraine in light of recent concerns of a possible invasion by #Russia.    
Then, how should the #West stop #Putin from invading #Ukraine? 
In the 1970s #Kissinger privately summarized US policy toward the #Kurds this way; sounds like a pithy template for our policy today toward #Ukraine and #Taiwan: “Promise them anything, give them what they get, and f--- them if they can’t take a joke.”
The U.S. considers fascists as democrats. Surprised?   #racist #USA #America #Ukraine #Fascism #fascist #racism #fascists #Democrats #democracy #DemocracySummit
#German Economic Affairs Minister Robert Habeck warns in an interview of “severe consequences” for the #NordStream2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany if Moscow attacks #Ukraine. 
#Russia has since shredded its Budapest Memorandum commitments to #Ukraine: - used military force to seize Crimea - initiated/sustained conflict in Donbas - now threatening major new invasion  Yet Ryabkov claims Ukraine needs nothing more than Budapest Memorandum???  3/3 
In 1994 Budapest Memorandum #Russia committed "to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of #Ukraine" and reaffirmed its obligation "to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine." 2/3 
After #Russia demanded guarantees for its security, DFM Ryabkov was asked about guarantees for #Ukraine: "We provided all the relevant guarantees even when the Budapest Memorandum was signed in 1994... all guarantees are provided and observed." (I am not making this up.) 1/3 
US experts - If #Russia were to attack #Ukraine, it could reach the Dnieper in three to four days - 
#NordStream2: "German minister warns #Russia over #Ukraine" - #Germany #gas #Gazprom #NS2  
"It is highly unlikely that #Britain or its allies will send troops to defend #Ukraine if it is invaded by #Russia, UK defence secretary #BenWallace has said." US intelligence claims that Russia has stationed about 70,000 troops near the border of Ukraine.
@Amy_Siskind A “Crook’s Crook”… always on stand by to turn a quick buck with zero regard for democracy or “real” Institutions. #Ukraine #LNG #Fracking  @Maddow @AndreaBNYC have had questions about #RickPerry behind the scene for YEARS   Right @SenJohnKennedy , #JohnCornyn @SenMikeLee ???
I am now hack Kitstlette ok. 🥺 #Ukraine 
#RickPerry is an example of how a mediocre white man from #Texas can rise to the heights of power, run for President and commit crimes in the #Ukraine and against American democracy. 
🇷🇺🇺🇸🇬🇧It is highly unlikely that #London and its allies would send troops to #Ukraine in case of a Russian invasion, #UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said.  UK unlikely to send troops to help Ukraine, defence chief says
