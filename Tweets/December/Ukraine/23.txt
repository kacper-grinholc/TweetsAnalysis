#Russian buildup near #Ukraine gains steam, new satellite images show  via @politico
Fishermen in #Ukraine’s Zhytomyr Oblast (west of Kyiv) discovered rare coins of #KyivRus. The coins date back 1000 years, and feature Ukraine’s national symbol, the #tryzub, or “trident”.  These coins of Kyiv Rus date back to when #Moscow was still nothing more than a swamp. 
I read in the #NYTimes about Putin militarizing Russian society..buildup of Russian troops on Ukraine border . I’m more concerned about Russia than a mild Covid variant !  #Ukraine #Russia #COVID19AB #OmicronVarient
Could #NATO members surge air defense equipment to #Ukraine and could it help the #Ukrainians establish an effective air defense system on short notice? Or would it be technically - as well as politically - untenable?  #Airpower #airforce
A nearly four hour press conference that only exposed the deep divisions, misunderstandings and outright dangers surronding #ukraine even as #russia, the #US and #Nato look ahead to January talks 
#Moscow was still nonexistent swamp land when #Kyiv was flourishing.   You can see for yourselves why #Russia keeps trying to steal #Ukraine’s historical legacy of Kyiv-Rus and pass it off as its own history.   No matter how much Moscow lies, it doesn’t change the facts👇🏻. 
@SecBlinken @SonerCagaptay @jensstoltenberg Perhaps, and I’m just thinking out loud here, if @NATO hadn’t crept further East after 1989 #Russia would feel the need to deploy their defensive forces in such close proximity to #Ukraine. Stop threatening #Russia and watch how fast the redeploy elsewhere. @KremlinRussia_E
Includes a seven-minute clip of yours truly sharing some thoughts on #Russia threatening #Ukraine with ⁦@PnPCBC⁩ host Paul Hunter. Thoughts like: we should tell #Putin to put that gun down before we talk.

Putin has boxed himself in threatening #Ukraine. #joebiden should turn the problem on its head inviting #Russia to join #NATO along with Ukraine. Above all, Russia has more in common with the west than any other region #potus #KamalaHarris #kremlinrussia_e
Putin wants "security guarantees". Finland 🇫🇮🇪🇺 has EU's longest border with Russia. 1 340 km. S-400 missiles close to our border. Where are our guarantees?  Just asking. #Ukraine   #NATO 
Why did the #USA just send sabotage #poison to #Ukraine?  Why is the US angering @KremlinRussia_E   Is it because #jacobrothschild wants #yukos ???  #BuildBackBetter means #Bombers for #Russia   #NATO must be stopped 
#Putin - Why should he have any say over the #Ukraine?  At the heart of it, Putin is STILL a #KGB man.  The #Russian &amp; #Ukranian ppl do not want a war. Putin’s ego is driving him.
On Christmas Eve 1991, thirty years ago #OnThisDay, #Norway joined a growing number of states in recognising #Ukraine as a sovereign and #independent state. Since then, 🇳🇴🇺🇦 relations have steadily become broader and deeper. Happy anniversary!! @NorwayMFA @MFA_Ukraine 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has praised what he described as a “positive” U.S. response to the Kremlin’s demands for legally binding security guarantees to defuse a stand-off over #Ukraine.
Would you write a long manifesto to justify invading a country? I totally would #ukraine #Putin #NYE2022
@JosepBorrellF @DmytroKuleba Concerned #Putin is putting himself in box with #Ukraine. Creating a situation where he will think he has only one choice which is to invade. Which coincidently will be what #Putin wanted to do from the start, kill youth, kill youth, kill youth. Why? #ThrillKill. It’s primitive.
Tensions at #Ukraine-Russian border, troops massed on border, and U.S. w @NATO allies threaten economic sanctions and military aid. #CyberAttack feared. #VladimirPutin blames NATO, compares NATO’s acts to Russian missiles sitting on Canadian-U.S. border. 
Why #Putin is acting like a man who has run out of time  Analysis: As #Ukraine drifts from the control he desires, disdain for potential negotiating partners leaves the option of force. | #Russia | The Guardian -

#UKRAINE: The Ukrainian MoD significantly expanded the group of Ukrainian women who must register for possible compulsory military service in the event of a war.
@frehoula He probably is not aware any aggressive action will result in enormous number of warheads in any other NATO country and decades of cold war. What is better? Defensive systems in Ukraine or deadly weapon all over the place. @KremlinRussia_E please rethink your choices #Ukraine.

@BBCWorld The way #Russia gave no attack guarantees to #Ukraine on the nukes treaty?
"The Kremlin’s early plan of “waiting it out”, for Ukrainians to lose patience with their new government and for the west to lose interest in #Ukraine, was no longer viable.  The Kremlin “decided the status quo was intolerable and it needed to be changed."
The Ministry of Defense of #Ukraine obliged women from 18 to 60 years old to register for military service. #Ukrainian girls are ready to fight #Russia !

I feel like the Russia/Ukraine threat has a strategy of Trump sweeping in and talking his old pal Putin off the ledge after he takes the world to the brink, thus “saving the day”. Once Trump gets back in WH, Putin will has his pawn in place. Thoughts? #Russia #Ukraine
#US/#EU made a deliberate decision to pull out from #Russia's sphere of interests &amp; concentrate on their own regional issues. Diplomatic tourism is a weak response. Military presence, joint military maneuver, sharing weapon technology could deter Russia from invasion of #Ukraine.
