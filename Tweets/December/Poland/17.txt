#Discovery Condemns New Polish Media Law as “Attack on Independent Media” "The law was designed to target..#TVN24, #Poland’s most-watched news channel..whose reporters have often been critical of the country’s conservative ruling Law &amp; Justice (PiS) party"
This is a repeating pattern in action of PiS government in #Poland. If they want to do something controversial and they fail in summer, they try it again just before Christmas. They did it with judiciary reform in 2017 &amp; now with #lexTVN directed against independent media.
#Poland: #lexTVN was unexpectedly passed in the Sejm today. The process to vote for the bill, which will force US company @Discovery to sell the majority of TVN group shares, is considered illegal by the opposition. Before becoming law, the president must sign the bill. (1/2)

@AndrzejDuda The EU, US, and UK have all previously criticised the proposed legislation citing its potential to weaken the media environment in #Poland.  If the bill is signed into law by @AndrzejDuda it will mark a direct attempt to silence critical media in Poland. 
#Poland: PiS, the ruling party, is using the distraction of the holidays to push ahead with #LExTVN - the law which marks a major escalation in the attack on #mediafreedom in the country.   President @AndrzejDuda must veto the bill.
