#Covid_19 infections increase in #Europe. But vaccines are saving lives.   Today, #Poland had 794 deaths, 75% of which (600) were not vaccinated.   My appeal is to all Europeans who have not yet been vaccinated: do it for yourselves, do it for others. Together, we can make it.

The showpiece of the city's medieval defences, the Barbican was built at the end of the 15th century to protect Kraków's main entrance and was connected to the Floriańska Gate via a drawbridge over the moat that surrounded it.  #Barbican #Kraków #Europe #poland
