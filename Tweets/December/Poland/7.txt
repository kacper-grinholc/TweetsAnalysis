#OTD in 1893 Henryk Floyar-Rajchman was born, a politician and a Major of the #Polish Army. He was one of the people behind the daring operation of getting 75 tons of Polish gold out of #Poland in September 1939. There‚Äôs a short post about it:  
Why aren't #NATO or"coalition"troops in #Ukraine RIGHT NOW?  All the talk of democracy,liberators &amp; other horseshit in the middle east justifying failed Imperial Contractor debacles yet nothing for a European non-Mongol democracy next to #Poland &amp; #Rumania? F*CK little #Putin

#Poland perceives #Morocco as one of the most important partners on the African continent, with which it wants to develop economic cooperation based on a significant and not fully used potential on both sides.  
@NATO, #Ukraine should have been invited into the organization with #Poland, #Hungary, and the #Czech_Republic. Ukrainian membership cannot be delayed any longer.
that would leave the undersea route with only one rationale (And I have to applaud Putin on that move, even if it was too easy): #Germany and #Russia concurred that they did not want to risk the Baltic states and #Poland having a finger on the pipe. @Halsrethink @nglinsman 
This is what freedom looks like.  Some of us may have already forgotten because of #COVID19vaccines regimes.  Well done #Poland for not accepting #covidpass oppression &amp; #Covid19 restrictions.
