#OTD in 1893 Henryk Floyar-Rajchman was born, a politician and a Major of the #Polish Army. He was one of the people behind the daring operation of getting 75 tons of Polish gold out of #Poland in September 1939. There’s a short post about it:  
Why aren't #NATO or"coalition"troops in #Ukraine RIGHT NOW?  All the talk of democracy,liberators &amp; other horseshit in the middle east justifying failed Imperial Contractor debacles yet nothing for a European non-Mongol democracy next to #Poland &amp; #Rumania? F*CK little #Putin

Poland introduces further #COVID19 restrictions. Night clubs and other places where people can dance are ordered to close from 15 December. Home schooling is obligatory 3 days before and after the Christmas break. #Poland
#Poland perceives #Morocco as one of the most important partners on the African continent, with which it wants to develop economic cooperation based on a significant and not fully used potential on both sides.  
@NATO, #Ukraine should have been invited into the organization with #Poland, #Hungary, and the #Czech_Republic. Ukrainian membership cannot be delayed any longer.
that would leave the undersea route with only one rationale (And I have to applaud Putin on that move, even if it was too easy): #Germany and #Russia concurred that they did not want to risk the Baltic states and #Poland having a finger on the pipe. @Halsrethink @nglinsman 
This is what freedom looks like.  Some of us may have already forgotten because of #COVID19vaccines regimes.  Well done #Poland for not accepting #covidpass oppression &amp; #Covid19 restrictions.

🇵🇱 #Poland is a fantastic country &amp; they're not banning jabbed/unjabbed at Christmas markets as well implementing domestic #vaccinepassports 👏  However, our first hand experience there has witnessed strong compliancy amongst Poles for jabs, masks, &amp; using the EU DCC. 
Migrants do not stop trying to get to #Europe  Despite the fact that in recent days the number of migrants trying to break into #Poland has dropped markedly, this night a group of 30 #migrants tried to cross the border twice. 
The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that migrants who are already in #Poland and have appealed to the courts cannot be deported to #Belarus.  Between August 20 and December 3, the European Court of Human Rights dealt with a total of 47 requests from migrants (44 vs 🇵🇱).  
The #Belarusian army has informed the #Syrian migrants stranded at the border with #Poland that they must storm the border to #Europe within 3 days, or that the army will send them back to their country, according to the #Russian newspaper "@novaya_gazeta ".
