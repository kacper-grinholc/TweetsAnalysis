#Poland The Polish parliament just rejected a bill from the civil society to criminalize #abortion (including home abortion with abortive pills) &amp; ban the possibility of abortion in case of rape. Most of ruling party MPs from #PiS voted against it though 20% actually voted for.

👏🏼 Top advisor in 🇪🇺’s highest court said today that the principle of linking the bloc’s budget to respect for #RuleOfLaw is compatible with the bloc’s laws and challenge by #Hungary &amp; #Poland should be dismissed.  Withhold funds from states that trample on 🇪🇺 values! 
@SophieintVeld @rdanielkelemen @vonderleyen A few years outside the #EU and its subsidies might provide  salutary lessons for both #Poland and #Hungary

@Hallowedland777 @prof_freedom Great !  And, I hope #Poland stays the course of freedom, and won't be influenced by the Covid Fascists in #Germany and #Austria.
The occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq in the Middle East in recent years, the famous ‘Arab Spring,’ the anti-Syrian sanctions, and ‘other fruits of democracy’ have brought about this situation.  #Poland #Refugees
Facebook's parent company Meta has linked the #Belarusian KGB to the setting up of dozens of fake social media accounts of people posing as journalists and activists to stir up a migrant crisis on the border of #Belarus and #Poland.

#Poland and #Hungary cannot expect the benefits of EU membership without also following its rules. Their governments are trying to look strong, to impress voters, so the EU must try to get its own message across to people directly 
@guyverhofstadt Got to laugh at @guyverhofstadt and the undemocratic #eu when they harp on about democracy and rule of law 😂  What a load of 💩Guy and the eu sprout.  #Democracy #UK #Poland #Hungary 
Blowing my own trumpet again now, as #Poland celebrates a #Covid19 fall for first time in the wave, exactly when I said it would!  27,356 new infections in the last 24 hours, down 772. But 502 deaths, and likely to keep rising for a week 
@F4JOfficial @F4JOfficial Many fathers have their children unlawfully abducted &amp; illegally retained in places like #Poland @F4JOfficial can help by lobbying for a change in the law &amp; the closing of the “Nicolaou” legal loop which is facilitating international child abduction. From the UK

This is very welcome.   EU funds to member states should be conditional on fully upholding LGBT+ rights &amp; the rule-of-law.   The Hungarian &amp; Polish Govts are in flagrant breach of such requirements.   #ECJ @LGBTIintergroup @ILGAEurope @MariaWalshEU @emireland #Hungary #Poland

While AG's opinions are non-binding, they are usually confirmed by final ECJ rulings. The #conditionality regulation was legally adopted in 12/2020 &amp; doesn't require a Court ruling to be launched. The EC has simply given #Poland &amp; #Hungary more time to dismantle the #RuleOfLaw ⌛️
The @EUCourtPress Advocate General: The #RuleOfLaw #conditionality mechanism is in line with EU law and the #Poland-#Hungary legal complaint against it should be dismissed. The @EU_Commission has delayed the launch of the mechanism for almost a year now 👇

Years ago, William Lawson had a very good ad : "No rules, Great scotch". Now with the support of the @EUCourtPress AG, we can legally say "No rule of Law, no EU money". 😀 #Poland #Hungary #conditionality
