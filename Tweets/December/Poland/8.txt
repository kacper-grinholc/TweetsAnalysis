We are also proud to announce the expansion of our ClinLife Registry, the patient-centric clinical trial database that helps patients learn about and join trials, to #Poland and #Austria in partnership with @Boehringer Ingelheim! Full press release here: 
#Poland has been reporting around 20,000 new infections and around 500 #covid19-related deaths per day since the middle of November and tightens coronavirus restrictions to combat Omicron variant
That is not even to mention the situation on the #Belarus-#Poland border, which has Putin's fingerprints on it as well. 
More thoughts on #Poland:  The #Covid19 positive test rate today is 25%.  The fact infections were falling but have now stopped doing so indicates to me a high likelihood that #Omicron is seeded and growing, currently on a par with falling Delta cases, hence overall cases stable
More bad data from #Poland with the highest daily death toll for 7.5 months  592 new victims of #Covid19, although it's only 21 higher than last Wednesday's death toll.  Cases today 28,542, down less than 2% meaning the 7 dat rate is effectively unchanged for a 3rd day.
➡ Tuesday's video call between #US President Joe #Biden and Russian President Vladimir #Putin "did not produce a new settlement regarding #Ukraine," the head of #Poland's National Security Bureau said on Wednesday.  
🚛 In response to the recent escalation in tensions between #Belarus and #Poland, new rules on the placement of navigational seals on all trucks entering Belarusian territory come into force this week. A similar decree already applies to Lithuanian trucks.

"We split away the history of our recent past with a thick line. We will be responsible only for what we have done to help extract #Poland from her current predicament, from now on" (Tadeusz Mazowiecki, 1989) Should this rule also guide tough political transitions in #Africa?
