#French @Vachier_Lagrave is the new World Champion in #Blitz #CHESS!  A bitter disappointment to the 🇵🇱#Polish Grand Master Jan-Krzysztof Duda and the home audience.  Congratulations to 🇫🇷#France! And Thank You to #FIDE &amp; #Poland's Chess Federation!

Polish GM Jan-Krzysztof Duda defensed himself very well with Black in the first replay. I am hoping 🇵🇱#Poland's Grand Master takes the Victory home!

#FIDE ought to figure out a less #unfair system, so that the #RealWinner of Rapid and Blitz are able to #PLAY their way to the very top. This was the #BiggestBummer of the tournament in #Poland.  The Calculator should NOT be a Chess Player… 
for my Poles friends, I wish Duda to win the Blitz part of #rapidblitz this evening. #Poland #chess

Fantastic Rapid and Blitz #CHESS tournament in #Poland! Unfortunately my countryman Magnus Carlsen couldn't defend his double titles in both disciplines, but in the final replay, I hope Polish GM Jan-Krzysztof Duda takes the Victory.  Thanks #FIDE &amp; #Warszawa! 👍 
#Russia's puppet "state" of #Belarus is proliferating an anti-#Poland #disinfo fake that is actually WORSE than those heinous lies used against Ukraine back in 2014. The world barely noticed so far - and I'm not sure whether it's a good thing

These refugees from #Poland were housed in royal gardens turned into accommodations and some became traders in Herat province of #Afghanistan. Today Poland can stand by refugees like people from Iran and Afghanistan stood by them in WWII. Humanity has always stood together.
