By placing #Naval assets armed with Mach 9 #hypersonic #nuclear #missiles off the coast of #WashingtonDC, #Russia guarantees that those who give the order to place such missiles in #Poland will be turned to radioactive ash. A measured act that would free the #USA from #DeepState
What actually was said... If #USA places hypersonic nuclear missiles in #Poland, that is 5 minutes from Moscow. #Russia has #hypersonic #nuclear #missiles that work from ships/submarines. It will answer by placing then 5 minutes from #WashingtonDC.
