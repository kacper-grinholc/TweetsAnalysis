@habte @Freezyo10 Most of the people who are being murdered, starved and tortured to death by Abiy’s henchmen aren’t even 27 years of age. In fact most aren’t even adults yet. So stop trying to make this about the past. This is pure genocidal fascism with the help of #China #UAE #Turkey #Russia
A little perspective can help:  #Russia and #Turkey have been announcing JVs since the 1990s...none of them succeeded.  Meanwhile, #China #Israel #UK #USA #Germany have many successes in helping Turkey advance its miltech. 
#turkey, #china, #UAE are funding the genocidal, civil-war monger facsist in Addis Ababa, who deceived the world into winning a Nobel peace prize.  But,ironically, incited an ethnic war. These nations and their allies will be equally accountable for the war crimes on Tigreans.
