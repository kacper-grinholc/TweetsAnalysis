President Tayyip #Erdogan says he has lowered #Turkey's inflation to around four percent before and that he will achieve that again soon as annual price rises hit 21 percent due to his push for aggressive monetary easing that has sent the lira crashing. 
In #Turkey it's difficult to state if this Voltaire's proposal applies more: “Anyone who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities” or this reverse one “Anyone who can make you commit atrocities...” ? #ArmenianGenocide #TurkeyIsATerrorState
