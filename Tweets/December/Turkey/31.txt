Erdoğan calls on citizens to keep all savings in lira as currency remains volatile #Turkey 
The Turkish Lira has had a bad start to the year. Further rate cuts will only imperil capital flows further. Inflation and the associated risk-premium is likely the most prominent headwind in 2022. #Turkey #Lira 
Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov’s latest threats to Ankara have betrayed the undercurrent tensions b/w #Turkey &amp; #Russia that have been simmering for a while @fehimtastekin 
Massive price spikes on basic commodities  in #Turkey as #inflation approaches to 3-digit numbers. Electricity cost/kWh risen 230% as new year “gift”. #Erdogan’s “finance advisor” #GokselAsan claims he will be expecting “negative” inflation in #NewYear2022🤷🏻‍♂️.
