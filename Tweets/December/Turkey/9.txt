@JustinTrudeau Better late than never. Reportedly, your govt has been giving a deaf ear to the #Tigraygenocides happening since Nov 2020. Moreover, there are reports that #Turkey is supplying war drones whose parts allegedly originate from #Canada. #stopdroneattacks #TigrayGenocide

#Turkey &amp; the #UAE fully backed by #USA. a company which made the #BayraktarTb2 combat drones fighters under licence/warrant from #USA. both countries also intervened in the #Tigray conflict &amp; also attacked civilians using drone warfare. so sad. @POTUS @USUN #StopArmingUAE_Turkey 
#Greece and #India should strengthen their bonds. It is quite important to reinforce our relations. We have to lay the groundwork. Nowadays, both countries are facing the exact same common enemies, #Turkey and #Pakistan.

I am convinced no country today intervenes in another country without green light from z US. Nations that have come to rescue #AbiyoAhmed with their Drones: #China, #UAE, #Turkey, #Iran, #Eritrea etc have done so with knowledge of #USA. But why US support a genocidal regime?
