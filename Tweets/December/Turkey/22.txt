@USAmbUN Madam ambassador, we have been saying this for over a year but your administration doesn't bother to stop the arm sell by #Turkey #China #UAE #Iran to the #Ethiopia  government. Take action and stop it.
#Ethiopia is a terrorist state.  🇪🇷 continues to commit atrocious crimes in #Tigray with fresh re-invasition.   🇪🇹 is terrorizing the people of #Tigray on daily basis.  Today it bombed the power plant using drones from #Turkey.   Drones targeted civilians killing at least 48.
