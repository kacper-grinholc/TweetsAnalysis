They can supply weapons, they can also send #Syrian terrorists, and they will be happy to provide military consultations to #Ukraine. #Turkey will not miss the chance to harm #Russia.
Even #NATO membership and cooperation with the #Ukrainian side in the form of the sale of drones to #Kiev will not affect the decision not to enter into confrontation with #Russia.  It is obvious that it is unprofitable for #Turkey to openly oppose #Russia.
#Ankara will not side with #Kiev if hostilities begin with the participation of #Russia and #Ukraine, #RIA reports, citing Bloomberg. #Turkey's reluctance to confront #Russia reflects #Erdogan's foreign policy of "maneuvering".
