#Turkey slams #Cyprus over exploration license for Exxon, Qatar Petroleum in #Mediterranean 
"Turkish President @RTErdogan appointed a new treasury &amp; finance minister Thursday after the previous one stepped down as the country’s currency has tumbled to record lows."  Dear Erdogan, I have a viable solution for you: replace YOURSELF to save #Turkey.
This is something you don’t have to miss : Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Tanju Bilgic : The permission granted to ExxonMobil-Qatar Petroleum Partnership in the Eastern Mediterranean violates #Turkey’s continental shelf. 
Turkish FA Spokesperson Tanju Bilgic: The permission granted to #ExxonMobil- #Qatar Petroleum Partnership in the Eastern Mediterranean violates #Turkey's maritime zone. 
For any #macroeconomics folks: Erdogan's #interest slashes are aggressive but when #inflation is surging is it better to raise rates like #Brazil, hurting consumer demand and shrinking #GDP, or lean into it like #Turkey, sacrificing currency power and losing #foreign #investment? 
I didn't realize #Syria invaded #Turkey... When did I miss this fascinating turn of events?

Council of Europe initiates action against #Turkey over #OsmanKavala detention 
If the Council of Europe caved in under pressure from #Erdoğan and looked the other way, the European human rights regime would have become collateral damage alongside #Turkey's rule of law. Today, European values have survived one of the most significant challenges in decades.
