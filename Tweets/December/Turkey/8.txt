Mustafa #Gurbuz: From a long-term strategic perspective, Turkey’s growing isolation in the #Mediterranean set off alarm bells across the #Turkish political spectrum. Thus, with de-escalating regional conflicts, #Turkey seeks to heal self-wounds. | ACW 
17. What we are seeing is #Erdogan being literally saved from his political grave by the #GCC &amp; in fact the #Iran-#Turkey-#Qatar bloc to become even more powerful in the region with #KSA &amp; #UAE adding financial incentives &amp; private factions triumphing over national interests.
If the @POTUS administration serious about peace in #Ethiopia   Should take Jeffery Feltman out of the #US Specials Envoy for the #HoA .  Should stop involving #Egypt  I am not even sure why he is bothered to go to #UAE #Turkey

This is awesome,what a fantastic idea. Thank You #Turkey for your care and kindness towards stray #Cats ❤️❤️ #StrayCatsMatter #KindnessMatters #BeKind #catlovers ❤️❤️❤️ 
14. We are seeing the factions that have pushed out these policies willing to give up a level of political independence for a complex cooperative model of interdependency with rogue actors in #Iran &amp; #Turkey where global security is sacrificed to corrupt financial benefits.
Finally started watching Payitaht Abdulhamid Season 1. #Turkey #Turkish #Ottoman #History #TVSeries 
11. As a result, #Iran retains a powerful ally who is willing to stay aboard &amp; cling to power even at the expense to popular will &amp; democratic processes. #Erdogan's #Turkey is strengthened &amp; #UAE &amp; #KSA are stuck politically with a dependency.
10. #UAE and #KSA may well consider this arrangement between #TUrkey, #Iran, and themselves a path forward towards lowering #Iran's threat to their own security in the region. However, by investing into #Erdogan before any clear outcome, they are empowering him &amp; losing leverage.
In 1991 Kurdish MP Leyla Zana was stripped of her immunity &amp; imprisoned for only speaking Kurdish in the Turkish parliament.  Today, HDP MP Ayşe Sürücü’s microphone was turned off when she started to speak Kurdish in Turkish Parliament.  For #Kurds nothing has changed in #Turkey. 
8. The clearly coordinated #MBS visit to various #GCC states &amp; #Erdogan's visits to #UAE and #Qatar indicate #KSA's likely cooperation with #Turkey on various matters. In addition to the $10 billion in investments from #UAE, Erdogan is getting even more deals from Doha.
7.Moreover, this appointment makes sense in the context of the upcoming #GCC cash infusions into #TUrkey's economy and the expected normalization between Turkey &amp; a number of Arab states.
6. Let's recall that #UAE is advancing a trade route connecting the country to #Iran and #Turkey leaving behind reliance on the #Suez Canal. The talks had been ongoing for some time, but a minister with links to #Iran comes in handy for the impending implementation of this idea.
5. More than a commentary on #Turkey's current bilateral relations with #Iran that should give pause to those Washington "insiders" who think that Turkey is the ultimate bulwark against the expanding #Iran hegemony in the region, this appointment raises questions on #UAE's moves.

Thread: 1. That #Turkey's new economy czar is linked to #Iran's #Quds force should surprise exactly no one. #Turkey's cooperation with the #IRGC has grown over time on a number of fronts.

Our latest video is now on @youtube Tourists to Turkey normally flock to the west and south coasts so we thought we would discover the East to show you the parts of Turkey that you don't normally see.  #vanlife #Turkey  #travel #travelvlog 
Getting up to speed on #Turkey and the #Lira   You think there’s any gold left in the shops there?   Lowering rates to quell inflation is a great policy

#UAE,#Turkey supply of drones to #Abiy's regime is causing countless human suffering in #Tigray, #Oromia &amp; #Amhara regions.  The IC needs to take action immediately to prevent civilian deaths. #StopDroneAttacks  @IlhanMN @BradSherman @POTUS @SecBlinken @USAmbUN @AmbassadorRice 💔

@AlMonitor @fehimtastekin If Circassians do not like it in #Turkey, they can go back to #Russia and experience firsthand yet another genocide. No one holds anyone in the land of #Turks. Yet they all flock to #Turkey like there is no tomorrow.

Is Ethiopia the new Syria?  What is certain is that while Washington has remained on the sidelines, #Turkey #Iran #UAE #China have provided Abiy Ahmed drones and other technologies to use against the Tigray and control the population. 
#Turkey’s expansion in #Africa catches global attention   Turkey’s unprecedented expansion of its influence in Africa in the past two decades is raising eyebrows.

#Turkey not only comes out w/ "incendiary rhetoric", but also commits aggressive actions that violate int’l law &amp; undermine stability in the Mediterranean region. This was announced on Wednesday by #Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis following negotiations w/ Russian President  Putin.

@USEmbassyAddis Thanks to #China, #Russian, #Turkey and other Ethiopian True friend, but #US is evil.
#Ethiopia is committing a #TigrayGenocide and #UAE, #Iran and #turkey are playing a big part in it. The @NATO needs to take an action. 
Turkey has prioritized the security of its energy supply as one of the central pillars of its energy strategy, leading to efforts to boost investments in the clean energy sector. #turkey #renewables  Source: @DailySabah  For more of today's #goodnews:

Where is the outrage for Tigray? For nearly a year, civilians have been targeted and the world continues to look away. It’s time for action. Children are dying from starvation and airstrikes! #Turkey, UAE &amp; IRAN must #StopArmingEthiopia  @POTUS @NATO  @UNGeneva @antonioguterres 
There are so many countries who are done and tired of #USA actions and are willing to work with #Iran to start trade and create more opportunities for #peace in the region.  #Turkey #Tehran 
@USEmbassyAddis The conflict will never end due to 1, #UEA 2, #Turkey 3, #Iran
The question remains why the international community and the US government failed to respond to #Iran, #Turkey, and  #UAE aiding the Ethiopian regime to commit genocide? Why not enact #NoFlyZonelnTigray to save the lives of civilians?  @POTUS @antonioguterres @UNGeneva @UNOSAPG 
UAE 🇦🇪 has been facilitating The fascist @AbiyAhmedAli and criminal Eritrean dictator for over a year now.   #Iran #Turkey #StopArmingEthipia   @POTUS @SecBlinken @NATO @antonioguterres 
#UAE50 #StopArmingEthiopia The Ethiopian government is committing a genocide upon his own #Tigray region with the support of #China #Turkey #Russia #Iran @POTUS @SecBlinken @UNGeneva @EU_Commission @USAmbUN @NATO_ACT #TigrayFamine 
In the face of the economic crisis, Turkish people are searching for ways to make ends meet. They have even resorted to selling their own clothes to be able to buy food. #Turkey

🇦🇿#Azerbaijani Silk Airways Ilyushin Il-76TD ‘ZP9101’ (hex #600829 | 4K-AZ41) seen on approach to Tekirdağ airport, Corlu, 🇹🇷#Turkey from Baku, returning ~1 hr later as ‘ZP9102’. I wouldn’t be surprised if it picked up #BayraktarTb2 ‘T-165’ which flew 2 days earlier at Keşan. 
#NoFlyZoneInTigray must be implemented to prevent further airstrikes by the Ethiopian govt. Civilians are being targeted. The int’l community has a responsibility to uphold its commitment to protect lives! #Turkey, UAE &amp; IRAN must #StopArmingEthiopia  @POTUS @NATO  @UNGeneva @UN
