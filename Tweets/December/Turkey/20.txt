Inflation in #Turkey will sooner or later be reduced to 4%, Erdogan said. Now this figure is 21%. The policy that led to the collapse of the lira is part of the war for Turkey's economic security, he said. This is a decrease in unemployment, export growth, investment
Turkey's troubled economy got reactions on Monday after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan referred to Islamic teachings to justify not raising interest rates to cushion the currency against historic falls.  #Inflation #Rate #Turkey   
And just like that... the most volatile, poverty-stricken, repressive region in Africa has transformed into an open bazaar for middle power adventurism. By flooding the #HOA with deadly drones #Turkey &amp; #Gulf monarchies hope to consolidate influence with devastating consequences.

Massive #currency reaction in #Turkey to the President‚Äôs statement on compensating locals for fx losses. While indicative of the extreme overshoot, what comes next is far from certain given the level of fx reserves and the alternative of using local currency would renew pressures 
What's happening in #Turkey is what modern warfare looks like.  Turkey regime is not palatable to globalist interests.   They tried fomenting social unrest a few years ago and it failed. So now they try to starve them economically.  They do the same in every country.

My quick thoughts on #Turkey:  1) This is a first step toward seizing FX deposits 2) Should be Turkey/usd bond bearish (shreds reserves) 3) Per earlier tweet, I don't think the uptake will be very high. This is aimed at poor unable to hoard FX/crypto 4) More high inflation coming

President Erdogan vowed that there will be "no going back" on #Turkey's rate cuts. RTE has singlehandedly TANKED the Turkish lira &amp; SLAMMED Turkey's economy with his wrongheaded economic policies. His support is sinking as fast as the lira. 
And that's why I don't trade currencies that are in the middle of blowing up.  I'll laugh at them. I'll make fun of them.  But sovereigns have the ability to kneecap *anyone* not named Soros.  $USDTRY #Erdogan #TurkishLira #Turkey
