All nations that specialise in #oppression and #genocide. Stop distracting! Your war is against Africans, not the US!
#UAE #Iran and #Turkey stop selling drones to the genocidal regime of #Ethiopia. #China has already committed genocide against #Uyghurs and #China is actively committing genocide against #Tigray by supplying Drones and technical assistance to #Ethiopia. @SecBlinken @JoeBiden 
The #Ethiopia|n gov, backed by #Turkey, #UAE50, #Iran, and #China  is bombing #Tigray, a historical #Africa|n region.   This is the new face of imperialism. #KnowMore
