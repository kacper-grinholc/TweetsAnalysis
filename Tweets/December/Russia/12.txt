@alexhallhall Would it be simplistic to suggest: that it gets difficult to stand up to the power of #Russia, #China, or #SaudiArabia, when we have already allowed them to buy up and control so much of the UK wealth already, not to mention in the case of Russia/Saudi, much control over (1/)

G7 Foreign Ministers‚Äô Statement on Russia and Ukraine¬† - United States Department of State. How many times will #G7 &amp; #Ukraine be asked to move the line in the sand? No more! #Russia must evacuate from the border &amp; Ukraine or be forcibly expelled. 
Western powers telling #Russia it will pay a "high economic price" for invading #Ukraine, is simply raising the price on a determined buyer  It's either for sale or not. That's how you approach the eastern mindset, in business or politics
2) The thing is, I believe they're pushing right now to force us into a #NuclearExchange with either #Russia #China or even both!  And #BrainDeadBiden will do anything his #GlobalistHandlers tell him to!  If that is successful, all they have to do is roll in &amp; mop up what's left.
The only real deterrent that #NATO and the #US have to stop #Russia from actioning #Ukraine right now is the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. Frankly, arming units at the tactical level isn‚Äôt even close to a feasible deterrent.

The fact that bullshits about the "imminent Russian invasion of #Ukraine" are being spread 24/7 even if #Russia doesn't intend to invade shows that the West is pushing Kiev to launch a large offensive against #Donbass so that the Russian response can be labeled as "aggression".

#India, as a regional leader, may claim to have its unique voice heard in the context of Afghan crisis. Thus, collaboration on the Afghan crisis has emerged as one of the most important aspects of #Russia-India relations: @alorientalist. 
How about this for a deal between the US, #Ukraine, #NATO and #Russia.  Ukraine gets NATO Membership for the security of its sovereignty but no offense NATO missles will be deployed near its border with the exception of two instances-
