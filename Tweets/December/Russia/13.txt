#Russia says it may be forced to deploy mid-range #nuclear missiles in Europe 
NATO is pushing #Russia towards what in every simulation ends up in #NuclearWar.    This is Russia's desperate last ditch statement.  The language is unusual and very telling for Russia.  There will be an ultimatum ...then the shit hits the fan. ...soon. 
Clearly the freedom to speak total nonsense is absolute in #Russia and is practiced with gusto at the very high levels of government institutions. Irresponsible example of crossing all the boundaries of international law and abrogating commitments held by Russia. No respect.

10. US policy of appeasement towards ANY country emboldens all other aggressors. That's why there are speculations that #Russia and #China are coordinating aggressive rhetoric and action against #Ukraine and #Taiwan at this time. Neither is retreating.
9. Whenever #US cedes power, BOTH #Russia &amp; #China exploit it; US has not done anything politically or otherwise to exacerbate any existing tensions between #RUssia and #China; it's not clear whether the political will to understand these nuances exists aside intel agencies.
#BREAKING WH issues readout of #Biden's conversation today with #Finland's president, #SauliNiinistö, in which multiple topics were discussed, incl. #Russia and #Ukraine.  #Niinistö #Putin #Zelensky 
8. Indeed, the mouthpieces for the Democrats are looking to appease both #Russia and #China simultaneously; that's why the #Taiwan minister's feed was cut during the #SummitForDemocracy despite that event being an occasion to rally against #Russia &amp; #China.
#Blinken publicly admits that #US created scare stories about "#Russia invasion of #Ukraine" just to block #NordStream2  "leverage on Russia" = economic warfare    
@PippaCrerar Did Johnson acknowledge that in 1991 US signed treaty with #Russia at the end of the Cold War and break-up of the USSR,  in which #Ukraine was recognized as a neutral buffer, and that US funded #Kiev riots which overthrew legal govt and drew Ukraine into West sphere of influence?
@global_amnesia @JohnRossomando @pepesgrandma BINGO  LET #RUSSIA INVADE UKRAINE   just like #Mexicans are invading USA
5. #Biden's pro-Russian #energy policies are not isolating #China; they are weakening Europe which as a result becomes more dependent on China for various favors. And a weakened Europe cannot "isolate" #Russia.
"They discussed their shared concerns about #Russia’s destabilizing military buildup along #Ukraine’s border and the importance of transatlantic efforts to de-escalate the situation." #Finland 
Another angle on the whole #Ukraine and #Russia situation. JUST having Russia posturing over an invasion will hurt the Ukrainian economy.  This can long term make Ukrainian politicians suffer and push Ukraine further into Russia's orbit.
3. Despite #Biden's rhetoric on #Russia and #China, ALL of his actions so far, everywhere in the world, have done nothing but empower both. From the US withdrawal in the Middle East to #energy policies, #Biden has done more for both countries than anybody in recent years.
