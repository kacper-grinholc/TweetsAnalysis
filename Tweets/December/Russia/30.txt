Call between Putin and Biden amid rising tensions about Ukraine  #Biden #JoeBiden #Putin #Russia #Ukraine
What people need to understand about tensions between #Ukraine and #Russia is that Russia doesn't intend to wage full-scale war on anybody and has no incentive to drastically escalate the current hybrid conflict on the border. 1/12
“He (#Syria’s #Assad) will become very strong, but not by his own power (via the powers of #Russia &amp; via others). He (#Assad) will cause astounding devastation (via the #Syrian war and far beyond its own borders) and will succeed in whatever he (#Assad) does…” - Daniel 8:24

In a statement describing Thursday’s phone call talks, the White House said #US’s #Biden urged #Russia’s #Putin to “de-escalate” the simmering tensions and “made clear that the #UnitedStates and its allies and partners will respond decisively if #Russia further invades #Ukraine”. 
As Putin and Biden talk, Kremlin mouthpieces are rushing to explain the motivations behind Russia’s surge in aggression. Fox News is helping them do their work! #BidenPutin #Tucker #Russia

#Moscow is pleased with the results of the new phone talks on Thursday between #Russian President Vladimir #Putin and #US President Joe #Biden, #Putin's aide has said. #Putin has, however, warned the #US against escalating #Russia sanctions as it would be “a colossal mistake”.

@STRATMIL @HeikkiPatomki @Vegarus ”Then why are you moving east toward Russia’s borders?” we have never received any clear answer.” Oh but you have. #Russia is an aggressor; it attacks, occupies, oppresses. The Eastern European countries cannot defend themselves alone against #putin’s shenanigans. #Ukraine #NATO
Always ironic &amp; hypocritical - Governments like #Russia that #spy the most, and suppress their own people the most - always label citizens who protest 'foreign agents'. An easy out, to shift public focus 
@MarQs__ Did #Russia just admit they're going to invade #Ukraine and forewarn the US not to impose sanctions? Is this the verbatim readout without mistranslation?
@Apex_WW Did #Russia just admit they're going to invade #Ukraine and that US sanctions will be met with something terrible? Am I reading this correctly?
“#Russian President, Vladimir #Putin on Thursday warned his #US counterpart, Joe #Biden in the call that new #Western sanctions against #Moscow could rupture ties between #Russia and the #UnitedStates and it would be a big mistake, the #Kremlin said.” 
#Russia: killing the competition. Russia is a cartel of one. 
"#Russia has a very ACTIVE ROLE in #ViennaTalks but it is NOT appropriate to talk about it apparently in such sensitive talks," said @Amb_Ulyanov to the #Iranian #London-based #TV: @IranIntl

Vladimir Putin warned US president Joe Biden in a call that new Western sanctions against Moscow could rupture ties between Russia and the US.  #Russia | #USA
I remember a time when it was big news when the heads of #Russia and the #USA were talking directly with each other. Today other topics seem to be more important in the #news . And both presidents even talked about the possibility to go to #nuclearwar . If that‘s no news what is?

It was never about the #Russia threat for the Democrats, only about controlling the narrative &amp; discrediting the Republicans. Now that #Biden is in office, he is going out of his way to justify appeasing #Kremlin - and the #media &amp; #NGOs are echoing him.

The White House releases a readout of the Biden-Putin call. @PressSec says President Biden "urged Russia to de-escalate tensions with Ukraine. He made clear that the United States and its allies and partners will respond decisively if #Russia further invades #Ukraine." 
The same can be said for the Wokery that infects our institutions and young people. The West is weaker because of it. #China and #Russia have already developed and deployed geopolitical strategies based on this perception.  Dangerous. 
Okay call went well, but now a “complete breakdown of relations” is on the table…   #Putin #Biden #Russia 
“The top #US military commander in #Europe wants to reinforce #NATO’s eastern flank with multinational battlegroups in #Romania and #Bulgaria because of concerns about #Russia’s moves around #Ukraine.” 
#Ukraine’s geographical proximity with both the #EU and #Russia enables it to extend its cooperation across both sides, especially owing to deep historical and cultural ties with Russia, points out Rahul Kamath. 
Some progress has been made in the call it seems #Ukraine #russia #USA. Call between Putin and Biden ended recently and lasted for about an hour. Some details are starting to emerge now.

Kremlin aides came away from today's Biden/Putin call with a positive view of the U.S. position towards core Russian concerns, according to Reuters. #Russia #Ukraine #USA
🔴 The Kremlin: #Biden warned #Putin of broad sanctions against #Russia if it continued to escalate over #Ukraine.
Somethings absolutely new. The #EU kept absolutely law profile in 2007-2011 and 2018-2019 when the future of the two “cornerstones of the European security”( #CFE and #INF Treaties) were at stake. Now the EU woke up and wants to have its own say. How should #Russia perceive it? 
Possible risks to #Russia 🇷🇺's relations with #Pakistan 🇵🇰 in 2022:  1) Russia's support for #India 🇮🇳's roles in Central Asia and #Afghanistan 🇦🇫   2) Pakistan's alignment with #Turkey 🇹🇷 in Eurasia   3) Russia's sale of S-400s to India and rejection of Pakistan's arms requests
A Kremlin aide is quoted saying Putin told @POTUS  that US sanctions on #Russia could lead to a complete breakdown in relations between Washington and Moscow.

I worry Kremlin wanted @POTUS call to add demands, or to work up a pretext for invasion before Jan. talks. Regardless, Putin was definitely gathering intel about US resolve to provide more military aid to #Ukraine &amp; sanction #Russia. Watch @ErinBurnett  @CNN 7pm. I'll be there.
