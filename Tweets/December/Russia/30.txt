Call between Putin and Biden amid rising tensions about Ukraine  #Biden #JoeBiden #Putin #Russia #Ukraine
What people need to understand about tensions between #Ukraine and #Russia is that Russia doesn't intend to wage full-scale war on anybody and has no incentive to drastically escalate the current hybrid conflict on the border. 1/12
‚ÄúHe (#Syria‚Äôs #Assad) will become very strong, but not by his own power (via the powers of #Russia &amp; via others). He (#Assad) will cause astounding devastation (via the #Syrian war and far beyond its own borders) and will succeed in whatever he (#Assad) does‚Ä¶‚Äù - Daniel 8:24

Always ironic &amp; hypocritical - Governments like #Russia that #spy the most, and suppress their own people the most - always label citizens who protest 'foreign agents'. An easy out, to shift public focus 
@MarQs__ Did #Russia just admit they're going to invade #Ukraine and forewarn the US not to impose sanctions? Is this the verbatim readout without mistranslation?
@Apex_WW Did #Russia just admit they're going to invade #Ukraine and that US sanctions will be met with something terrible? Am I reading this correctly?
‚Äú#Russian President, Vladimir #Putin on Thursday warned his #US counterpart, Joe #Biden in the call that new #Western sanctions against #Moscow could rupture ties between #Russia and the #UnitedStates and it would be a big mistake, the #Kremlin said.‚Äù
