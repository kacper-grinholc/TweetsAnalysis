US intelligence-sharing convinces allies of Russian threat to Ukraine via @FT #ukraine #russia 
#worldnewstonight on #ABC network. It was a piece how supposedly #Russia is ready to invade #Ukraine &amp; about #Biden/#Putin #virtual #meeting. In that piece, ABC news failed to mention Russian troops are 250 miles away from Ukraine. Also ABC used Victory Day military parade photos

#US intelligence-sharing convinces allies of Russian threat to Ukraine. #EU and #Nato allies have swung behind the Biden administration’s assessment that #Russia may be poised to invade #Ukraine.

No surprise. This's expected response to the US and #Britain Sep 15 announcement that the two countries would help #Australia build at least 8 nuclear powered submarines, to help counter “rapidly evolving threats” in the Indo-Pacific region #Russia #China 
'nr' Voronezh is where they supposedly were in April, 200+km from #Ukraine. Btw, where would you expect #Russia to station its troops in normal times, w/ @NATO countries on its Western borders? Siberia?

🧵#Putin #Russia has far more to gain from threatening to invade than actually invading #Ukraine. Putin peddles in provocation, #disinformation &amp; revels in instability, giving him an air of relevance
By delivering #S400 to India, #Putin may kill two birds with one stone—demonstrating to both US &amp; his own electorate how #Russia has successfully bypassed sanctions &amp;, managed to keep on track its ties with key partners, opines @AlexisZakharov. 
📢First DPR of #Russia to UN Dmitry Polyanskiy: we are guided by principle “African solutions to African problems". From the start, we warned the West that they shouldn't interfere in 🇪🇹 &amp; that they shouldn't try to do anything in a non-transparent way. #NoMore @FikreJesus

Some states that have called for dialogue rather than confrontation have cited that de-escalation as evidence that #Russia would not embark on a full invasion unless provoked.  But US intelligence on the recent troop deployments has shifted that analysis.  
🇷🇺#Russia set record #agricultural #exports ($31 Bn by November 28).👩‍💼  The highest growth rates are observed in the fat &amp; oil industry (+49%). The main export fell on #grain ($9.4 Bn). Main importers are 🇪🇺#EU (13%), 🇹🇷#Turkey (12%), 🇨🇳#China (10%). 
I've always found Putin's "one people" argument incoherent in an abusive husband kind of way: Ukrainians &amp; Russians are one people, have shared history, language &amp; culture. Therefore, #Russia will invade #Ukraine, kill more "brothers &amp; sisters", proving Russia really cares??🤔 
@anders_aslund If the West closes its airspace &amp; maritime zone for Putin's crime syndicate traffic it would be Maximum disrupting for #Russia.  Remember we're urgently tackling a Russian warmongering #Nazi Hitler here. And then some sacrifices need to be done.
#Russia/ Yes #Russia is a threat for all of us (the Europeans), might be Polish, Romanian or French. No doubt here.  Yes, #Ukraine is at risk. Very high risk.  But please, do not forget Baltic States. #Latvia #Estonia and #Lithuania are at risk as well. We need coordination. Now. 
@mikesay98 It’s not like #Russia has been buying massive quantities of #Gold…. Oh shit, wait a sec.. 🤣🤣😂😂😂 
Not all Europeans live in peace.   #Russia is planning an offensive in #Ukraine by using 100 battalion tactical groups with an estimated number of up to 175,000 soldiers.  #Europe will be alongside Ukraine. Attacking Ukraine means attacking all of us, all Europeans. 🇺🇦🇪🇺

Front page of Monday 6 December @FT’ front page, with #Ukraine and the threat of military invasion by #Russia as the main story: 
#Turkish government has announced that #Russia is going to help its industry to develop the ill-fated TF-X fighter jet! In fact,  #Turkey will have No option rather than investing on a Turkish version of Sukhoi Su-75 Checkmate which won't fly before 2035! 
If Putin starts another offensive against Ukraine it would be his last big mistake. #Ukraine #Russia
"There are tactical reasons for threatening an invasion, but the real cause may lie in the Kremlin’s fixation with righting what it sees as a historical injustice."  Good read. #Ukraine, colonized by #Russia, has a better historical injustice argument IMHO
Offsetting your preconceived notions of #Russia, consider their POV in a Russophobic world.  US led order, history of invasions, hostile neighbor states abound, global military presence of adversaries.  Russian goals may not be the best, but from their POV they can be justified.
@PaulaChertok #Russia's story begins with its the theft of the "Kingdom of Rus'" name. Solving Russian hurt is not the responsibility of Ukraine. Russia will never "be great again". The time of empires is gone. Yes, #Putin fear democracy.
A part of #Russia’s exploits in #Ukraine in the past years have revolved around classical Russian foreign policy goals; specifically securing the Western buffer (Ukraine/#Belarus) and deterring the expansion of NATO.  Only now is Putin being so direct.

The west needs to think carefully how to respond in case #Russia invades #Ukraine. Why? Because if the US and Europe is busy trying to save Ukraine and push back the Russians, it will give China the green light to invade Taiwan. The west will be fighting a two-front war. [1/2]

#Russia has claimed that a #NATO CL600 reconnaissance aircraft threatened civilian aircraft and that "catastrophe" was only avoided when a Russian passenger plane dived to avoid the aircraft as it crossed its path above the Black Sea. #EUToday 
@thehill "..Biden will tell Russian President Vladimir Putin in a meeting next week that the U.S. will come to Ukraine’s defense against the country. "  Will never happen.👈🇷🇺 #Russia #Russian
Note the difference - #China and #Russia created a mutually beneficial 'win-win' partnership - NOT an 'alliance' targeting a third party.. Do the math!  🥰🇨🇳🥰🇷🇺🥰

Imagine if on the Same Day... #Russia attacked #Ukraine  #China attacked #Taiwan  #NorthKorea attacked #SouthKorea  and #Iran attacked #Israel  - #JoeBiden would be so shocked, he'd probably shit himself again... that is, if he could remember how to read the headlines.

The problem is #US-led #NATO is trying to "negotiate" with #Russia from a "position of strength" without giving any reassurances of security to or concessions to Russia  That will never work. You need two sides to tango  "#Russia invasion of #Ukraine" 
I see no advancements since we landed in the moon. Same show. Satellite watch patrol. If at #Russia is blowing up satellites. Borrow the technology to help @nasa going after a meteor coming toward earth.  Same $how , $cientist$ are limited !  Curb your ego. Curve your ego.

This Q &amp; A sums up the #Ukraine-#Russia situation well. Putin's troop buildup &amp; intensified propaganda aims to scare Ukraine into retreating from its sovereign right to become a member of NATO, whose protection Putin's aggression only reveals is a necessity for Ukrainians. 
Novorossiya - could it happen or not?  What’s your take on the Russia and Ukraine tension. Do you think Russia will take action? Should nato stop expanding? Let me know what you think 💭  #Russia #Ukraine
I doubt words of the #Russia muppet "#Donetsk People's Republic Chair" saying that all people remaining in occupied #Donbas "now have RU passports". It's near-impossible to verify (until UA troops take the passport DB servers in Moscow) and physically hard to have perpetrated.
No #migration flows from #Russia to #Europe - #Putin 
The #US is hoping pressure from #Russia, China and some Arab Gulf states may yet persuade #Iran to moderate its negotiating stance in regards to the steps the #Biden administration must take before both sides return to the 2015 nuclear deal.

Doltish argument of the Amhara elite is difficult to explain. Tigray is the ideal pan-African. #UEA, #Iran, #Turkey, #Israel, #Russia &amp; #China is arming Ethiopia/ Eritrean Gov’t to kill &amp; destroy hospital &amp; clinics in Tigray. Which of Middle East Country is part of Africa?
