Look at this WAR-nography. Irresponsible headlines + "reporting" such as this underscore media's bloodlust to get clicks. #VladimirPutin has repeatedly said he does not want war w/ #Ukraine But US-led #NATO keeps gaslighting. Stop egging on war, media people. #nowar #Russia #USA 
Consolidating control of #Ukraine could prove extremely difficult for #Russia, given the likelihood of widespread, heavily-armed resistance. The US recently learned that lesson the hard way, but has Putin? asks @RichardHaass of @CFR_org.

@Yulisha All #Russia needs security wise is to turn #BRICS into a formal military alliance where #Russia ,India and China are the bedrock pillars of it .And its key is to settle and resolve the various disputes between SE Asia Pacific neighbours  from Indonesia  to Philippines

Met today with Judge Najla Ayoubi from #Afghanistan and activist Marina Pisklakova from #Russia. These brave women embody the fight of billions for a world free of violence for women and girls. I stand proudly in support of a new global treaty to end violence against women 
As expected, #EUCO leaders have warned of "massive consequences" and "severe cost" against #Russia including "restrictive measures coordinated with partners" in the event of any further military aggression towards #Ukraine
Instead of bored rhetoric about mystical ‚Äòdialogue‚Äô with #Russia, #EU must without delay draw up package of meaningful, painful sanctions against arrogant #Russia and put on the table. Sedation will not stop aggression against #Ukraine. Russia must see price of its deeds.
Lest we forget #Putin's #Russia is a menace to society. #Germany court found Russia ordered a 2019 broad-daylight #assassination of a former #Chechen militant in a #Berlin park, calling it #StateTerror." That it is.
