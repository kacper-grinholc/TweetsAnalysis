Scenario 3: #Russia goes for a "decapitation strike" seizing #Kiev.   Forcing #Ukraine in unilateral surrender is pointless since after withdrawal #NATO moves in.  Effective control of Kiev solidifies #Putin as a restorer of #Russian greatness but technically difficult.
Scenario 2: #Russia assumes control of #Novorossiya which roughly corresponds to #Donetsk oblast+most of Southern #Ukraine up to #Odessa.  Ukraine's geopolitical value is significantly reduced, losses access to #BlackSea, link to #Transnistria achieved.
Scenario 1: #Russia assumes control of entire #Donetsk region (including #Mariupol).   This is presented as a r2p (responsibility to protect) action to stop the civilian deaths in #DNR and #LNR.   Minimal gain, even if #Kharkiv oblast included. Highly unlikely.
