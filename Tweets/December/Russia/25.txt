#Russia is the enemy of the free world.  For #Putin, the cold war never ended and this is clearly his endgame, to implode #democracy via #Corruption and psyops. #china wants to beat us but #Russia wants to destroy us. 
@DavidLarter Why didnt @SkyNews ask #Putin why #Russia invaded #Ukraine twice in 2014 &amp; now threatens 3rd invasion after it had guaranteed to Ukraine (the Budapest Memorandum) that it would respect its sovereignty &amp; territorial integrity (ie not invade) if Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons?
#Russia blocks website OVD-Info that tracks political arrests  
So. #Russia, #Russia, #Russia.  The last 5 years (if not the last 22) have been a #Russian psyop, aided &amp; abetted by #GOPSeditiousTraitors 
As a declining power, #Russia will not be averse to the building up of deterrence against #China, for which she will need India &amp; also #Quad &amp; the #AUKUS, though she will not participate in these initiatives, notes Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty. #PutininIndia
