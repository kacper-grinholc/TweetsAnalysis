@DavidLarter Why didnt @SkyNews ask #Putin why #Russia invaded #Ukraine twice in 2014 &amp; now threatens 3rd invasion after it had guaranteed to Ukraine (the Budapest Memorandum) that it would respect its sovereignty &amp; territorial integrity (ie not invade) if Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons?
