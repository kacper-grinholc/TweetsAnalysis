The important things to remember about #Russia's #Ukraine involvement are that Russia has been invaded from its west numerous times, &amp; that its only warm-water ports are vulnerably close to Ukraine.  When the West sponsored color revolutions in Ukraine, we left Putin no choice. 
No surprise - US announcement of consultations in a small circle of Allies on how to accommodate Rus concerns about @NATO is presented in RUS media as a prelude to talks with #Russia. Quotes on no direct military steps to defend #Ukraine are picked up too.

@vtchakarova @TuckerCarlson &gt;&gt; IDJIT! #Russia invaded, annexed #Ukraine territory, NOT #NATO. Russia invaded Ukraine, NOT NATO. RUSSIA has massed troops from across Russia at Ukraine border, NOT NATO. Russia threatening foreign flights in international airspace, waters, NOT NATO.
Regarding #Ukraine #Russia conflict and prior tweets - I am not affiliated with either country. I just wanted to come up with ideas for both sides for #Putin and #Biden to consider.
for Domestic Audience - as well as“friends” such as China, Iran, Syria and North Korea. Putin can easily Ratchet up the Ukrainian Covert War, raising the Temp of the Stove. An Overt Shooting War would be much more risky - and Putin knows it.    #ukraine #russia #putin #Donbass
Western nations should collectively reaffirm their support for Kyiv and provide further military help to deter #Russia and demonstrate their commitment to the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. #NATO #security #europe
Putin’s Goal is to Keep the Pot Boiling.  Raise the Stakes (Troop Movements) and hope to convince NATO to respect Moscow’s Red Lines and stop sending Weapons to Ukraine.   This Bluff may still eventually Work - if it doesn’t, it makes great news copy...  #ukraine #russia #putin

The “Unresolved Conflicts” can be used as Bargaining Chips with the US/West on Future Events Seen and Unforeseen - START Nuclear Talks - or even in conjunction with Future Crises in N Korea or China Seas (see Russian missiles in Sakhalin).     #ukraine #russia #putin #Donbass

Putin expected little from “Summit”.  Compelling Biden to speak to him, however, maintains his Alpha Dog Status.  Should US cave to his saber-rattling and pull support from Ukr - so much the better, although even Putin knows its a long shot.   #ukraine #russia #putin #Donbass
As always a huge agricultural superpower #Russia 
Exactly. Also the stated idea that "if #Russia invades #Ukraine, we won't commission #NorthStream2" seems like saying "if they don't, then we'll accept it"—which is what Moscow is looking for. NS2 should have been nipped in the bud long ago. Its dangers are well documented. 
That furthermore leads to great wars were people die protecting interests that are not their own. #ww1 #china #russia #eu #usa It is not their blood that is flowing. It's yours.

These provocations have come after three decades, in which #NATO has continuously pushed closer to Russia’s borders and staged two coups in #Ukraine in 2004 and 2014, to bring pro-Western governments to power #Russia
#US President Joe #Biden said Wednesday he had warned his Russian counterpart Vladimir #Putin of unprecedented sanctions -- 'like none he's ever seen' -- if #Russia attacks #Ukraine
But would also compel Russia to Rebuild those Ukrainian areas it  officially occupies.   Putin has not the money nor desire to do that.       #ukraine #russia #putin #Donbass
Or… Land Lease offering for #Naval #Base from #Ukraine to #Russia; Then make sure there can be a a supply line / road from Russia to this area; still allow rest of #Ukraine entry to #Nato without including #Land #Lease area and road

@ElectionWiz #Ukraine is a nightmare battlefield, for #Russia! The unknown factor is: what will the Ukrainians do, unite or split. War is inevitable, #Putin is at the end of the road of free deals, in 2022 #Trump will be back. 
@LindseyGrahamSC @FoxBusiness @larry_kudlow Oh, please @LindseyGrahamSC after #Helsinki  how can you say Trump would be harder on #Russia ? Balderdash! @newtgingrich
#Biden emphasized his support for #Ukraine's #sovereignty and #territorial integrity and called for de-escalation and a return to #diplomacy   #putin #russia @KremlinRussia_E @GovernmentRF #news
Putin can't possibly think he'll get away with this! Oh that's right, world democracies looked away when he "annexed" Crimea in '14. Look for the old KGB officer to retake Georgia next...    #Russia #Ukraine #US #news #TensionsRising
"#Putin’s ultimate goal is to get #Ukraine to do what he wants, and what he wants is Ukraine to come back under its influence and control."  Wait, is #Russia going to invade #Ukraine? 
Whatever happened to Fort Trump, Poland. Yes I know he's not POTUS anymore, but how about getting some American troops in Poland? Paratroopers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade from Vicenza, Italy can get there, but it would take some time to get them spun up. #Poland #Russia
#Ucraina seems to be to #Russia what #Taiwan is to #China. Both great powers apparently not sovereign enough to tolerate the sovereignty of their small neighbours...

This comes after #Iran's chief negotiator was in Moscow. Iran will say and do enough to split the P5+1, particularly with the goal of keeping #China and #Russia on board for more meetings as it advances its nuclear program.

@TrevorFilseth reports on yesterday's call between President Biden and #Russia's president Vladimir Putin and how it might impact the future of #Ukraine.   
It’s impossible to overstate the likelihood that #TFG is blackmailing @GOP leadership. Since they are masters of projection, we should expect pedophilia and other sex crimes. The punch line: #Russia is supplying tRump with the kompromat.
It is good that SG of @NATO @jensstoltenberg had a chance to speak directly to @SecBlinken today, soon after the #Biden#Putin call.  Direct involvement of NATO is all the more fundamental in view of today's announcement by @POTUS on restricted consultations on NATO #Russia topics 
The #EU position on #Russia #Ukraine military charade should be clear to the #US @StateDept: have current chief diplomat for European affairs Victoria #Nuland replaced immediately before any steps are to be taken.
