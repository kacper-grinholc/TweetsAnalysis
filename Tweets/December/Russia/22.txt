It all comes down to whatever the Biden Administration decides to do regarding the Kremlin‚Äôs security proposal because America‚Äôs "allies" will be compelled to follow its lead since #Russia was correct in describing them as nothing but #US-led NATO puppets.

The Kremlin is now telling the Germans and French to decide whether they are prepared to go to nuclear war with #Russia over US plans to deploy nuclear-armed missiles in Romania, Poland and nuclear-capable operations in Ukraine and the Baltic states.
