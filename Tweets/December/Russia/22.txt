It all comes down to whatever the Biden Administration decides to do regarding the Kremlin’s security proposal because America’s "allies" will be compelled to follow its lead since #Russia was correct in describing them as nothing but #US-led NATO puppets.
The news that Joe #Biden’s big-ticket domestic agenda is cratering only adds to deep concerns that the United States is heading towards more conflict with #Russia and #China
The Kremlin is now telling the Germans and French to decide whether they are prepared to go to nuclear war with #Russia over US plans to deploy nuclear-armed missiles in Romania, Poland and nuclear-capable operations in Ukraine and the Baltic states.
