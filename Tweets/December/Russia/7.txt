"Putin said you Americans are worried by our battalions on Russian territory thousands of kilometers from the U.S., while we have genuine concerns about our security, Russia’s security."  #Ukraine #Russia #JoeBiden #POTUS #Putin #NATO 
US President Joe Biden warned his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin against any “military escalation” with Ukraine, as the two leaders held direct talks amid weeks of rising tensions over Russia’s military buildup near the Ukrainian border. *** #US #Biden #Russia #Putin #Ukraine 
You think Biden’s poll numbers are bad now, wait till he tries to send Troops to Ukraine  #Russia  #Ukraine
Attempts by #China or #Russia to expand their territory by invasions of #Taiwan or #Ukraine, respectively, would be serious mistakes with severe consequences

The idea that Putin and #Russia want to wage war as the planet dies is beyond comprehension.
Amid rising tensions between the #US 🇺🇸and #Russia 🇷🇺 over its possible invasion into #Ukraina 🇺🇦, two presidents @POTUS and @KremlinRussia_E are having a virtual summit. Prof. @OxanaShevel from @TuftsPoliSci joins us for further discussion.  Live Now 👇👇
.@MichaelSinghDC was quoted in a @WSJ article about the nuclear talks with #Iran and the possibility that the U.S. might have to rely on #Russia and #China to end the nuclear standoff.

instead of the #EU? Nuland also ignores the fact that Gorbachev was promised #NATO would not expand East if he agreed to German reunification. We lied. #Russia 2/2

#Ukraine must be fast-tracked into @NATO &amp; #EU to fend of #Russia from invading.
Funny why #Russia pulled ot of Austria a rich prosperous country ,Hitlers birthplace could it be it not allowing  NATO in  or nuclear weapons?
Pipeline isn’t even built, it’s leverage saved for later, more to it (also increased military assistance, $300m from $250m) #Russia 
My #predictions is #China and #Russia will move on #Taiwan and #Ukraine at the same time ane the #UnitedStates will do absolutely NOTHING about it. #war
Be prepared for a Ukraine-Russia war at the same time as a China-Taiwan war and a Middle Eastern war. Plus civil wars.. #tuesdayvibe #USA #Israel #Israeli #Iran #Iranian #Ukraine #Russia #China #Taiwan 
Is #Russia doing this because #Biden is weak or the Biden pull out of #Afghanistan in part because the administration knows we are headed to war with Russia and possibly#China? 🤔
@IlvesToomas @anders_aslund #Kremlin only knows how to steal from #russians. In order to distract, it tries to make it's neighbours miserable, too.  The way #underpantspoisoner has ruled #Russia, he seems to aim to be able to finish the same way as he started, by stealing food aid from fellow russians.
From Biden/Putin video meeting, I wonder: could there be a compromise? #NATO would not give #Russia a vote on who joins NATO (as Biden says), but could promise no "offensive weapons systems" in Ukraine "under current circumstances." 
It is hard to grasp but the world is seriously confronted with a situation in which #Russia is predicted to invade a neighboring country. Let sleeping dogs lie. However, increasing number of sources report on concerning Russian action. 
We may be going to war with #Russia over #Ukraine and @DavidLammy things who was at a party a year ago is of the highest national interest? More proof @UKLabour is unelectable!

We spent today at the front line in eastern Ukraine while Putin and Biden were talking. There wasn’t a sense among soldiers here #Russia is about to launch a major invasion. No one knows of course.  They were thinking more about the sporadic shooting going on like most days. 
The Biden Administration also reiterated its support for 🇺🇦 sovereignty and territorial integrity.   Biden also intends to discuss the results of the talks with his European allies and 🇺🇦 President Zelenskyy.   #ukraine #usa #russia #russianagression #diplomacy #ukilifeabroad 
  We should seek collaboration with Russia. Encourage Russia to open up economy for USA investment. RESET NOW. We both gain. @KremlinRussia_E @POTUS #Russia #Kremlin #USA #Opinion #Russian #BidenPutin #BidenDelivers @VP #Economyrising #European
"70% of #Ukrainians had a favorable view of Russia, and today after not only those invasions and biting off pieces of #Ukraine... the support, friendly feeling towards #Russia among Ukrainians is at an all time high about 12%," official testifies. Watch: 
@olgatokariuk #Ukraine's attempt to destruct the long term relations between #Russia and other European nations won't be successful. Instead, Ukraine should concentrate on building, constructive, respectful relations with those European nations &amp; get used to it. Europe won't boycott Russia.
This is the correct position to hold. And no, it doesn't mean that anyone is clamouring for WW3. #politics #Russia #Ukraine 
This is what the IC has offered #Tigray|ans for the past year: levels of concerns backed by 0 action. Yet they have continued their relationship with the genocidal #AbiyAhmed - and business as usual #turkey giving support along with #UAE #China #Iran #Russia. #Eritrea is on 
@JuliaDavisNews @WhiteHouse needs to release a convo summary longer than one paragraph otherwise #Russia's version will be the public record of the call. @JoeBiden #VladimirPutin #USA
#Biden warned #Putin the West would impose #sanctions on #Russia, military support for #Ukraine if Russia invades Ukraine.  Putin demanded guarantees #NATO would not expand further eastward.  #NordStream2 on the line; #JCPOA #nuclear deal revival also. 
U.S. President Joe Biden-Russian President Vladimir Putin call  Putin demands security guarantees from Biden to curb NATO expansion. U.S. says allies would bolster #Ukraine if Russia attacks #GeoPolitics #Russia #USA #NATO #CSTO  
How can we believe this when #Biden lacks the courage to answer unscripted questions from the press &amp; just scampers away?!?  #Putin #BidenPutin #BidenDelivers #Russia #Ukraine #BidenAdministration  
Readout: Vladimir #Putin had a telephone conversation w President of the Republic of Turkey Recep Tayyip #Erdogan at the latter’s initiative...    #Russia #Turkey #relations #energy #agriculture #Syria #Libya #Azerbaijan #Armenia #NagornoKarabakh #Ukraine
Putin continues sending troops to Ukraine's border while saying he will not invade Ukraine. #Russia #Ukraine #troops #border
Again #Russia is menacing #Ukraine claiming its neighbor is a failed state controlled by Western forces but Ukrainians are generally happy to engage with the West! This 2019 article is good background for today’s events  @jesuitseurope #Putin
