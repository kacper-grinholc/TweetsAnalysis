Ukraine is forever lost for Moscow. No one could unify the Ukrainians better than the Putinists. Only two democratic nations (Ukraine and Russia) could be friends again. Oligarchy is a dead end and this development is the very proof of it. #Ukraine #Russia

Top diplomats from the Group of Seven (#G7) gathered Saturday in Britain as the host country called for ‚Äúa show of unity against global aggressors‚Äù amid #Russia's standoff with #Ukraine.  
It's not that #Biden is so stuck in a diplomatic conundrum between #Russia and #Ukraine that he has no choice but to consider pushing #Ukraine to give away its lands. It's that #Biden actively PREFERS that course of action, following his approach to #Iran.

Plain, simple and correct. NATO itself is no issue. There is no scenario where NATO would invade Russia. It is the democracy behind it which the Kremlin fears. A free, democratic and prosperous Ukraine is the worst for the kleptocratic Oligarchy in Russia. #Ukraine #Russia

The idea that #Russia‚Äôs #S400 is simply a defensive system is nonsense. It was designed with radar capabilities specifically aimed at detecting the #US #F35 stealth fighter, arguably the most advanced air asset of @NATO. And it was sold to #NATO ‚Äúally‚Äù #Turkey.

#Russia and #Pakistan held high level talks on cybersecurity and #counterterrorism last week. #CyberSecurity  @PravinSawhney 
#Russia assumes it can somehow play the role of a catalyst in this process and by re-engaging in the project ‚ÄúCollective Security Program in the #PersianGulf‚Äù take the credit for normalization and de-escalation in these relations  
#Russia and the #Egyptian Navy began exercises in the Mediterranean 
@melaniejoly And #Russia building up aggressive invasion forces
#Putin continues his aggressive actions toward #Ukraine. Should we take #Biden's threats seriously? Is the #Russian leader trying to rebuild the old #USSR?  #Russia #Crimea
Pakistan is trying to show it is not too dependent on China:  1) #Pakistan üáµüá∞ reassured a visiting US Senate delegation of the limits of its alignment with #China üá®üá≥   2) Pakistani commentators also see Pakistan's ties with #Russia üá∑üá∫ as a sign of foreign policy diversification
Public opinion in #Russia üá∑üá∫ has swung against large-scale interventions in the post-Soviet space  The cases of #Belarus üáßüáæ and #Armenia üá¶üá≤ in 2020 exemplify this  Russia's belligerence in #Ukraine üá∫üá¶ is unlikely to give Putin the support bounce he enjoyed in 2014
