Asked why there have been so many public threats to use force recently, Shine quoted Kissinger '#Israel doesn't have foreign policy only internal policy' -- i.e. it is more about domestic Israeli politics than real strategy against #Iran.
Asked why #Israel fears a nuclear Iran (when Israel has a substantial if undeclared arsenal of its own), she says the worry is about regional proliferation and that #Iran would be 'more bold' in its use of conventional weapons against Israel.

How #Russia's position in #Syria is undermined by both #Israel &amp; #US while #Russia stands - a little like a Rabbit caught &amp; dazzled by Headlights, not knowing whether to retaliate against both &amp; teach them a Lesson - or lose all credibility within #Syria!
Shame on #MissUniverse #Philippines, @BeatriceLuigiG, for not doing what other contestants did in boycotting #MissUniverse2021 in #Apartheid #Israel.  I don't suppose she thought of all her #Filipino compatriots who comprise a large section of the workforce in #Arab countries. ++

@ShiningSadaf This might be the only way to get rid of #Israel .
Here is a humble prediction: Within few months, the PA will collapse, #Hamas ignite a wide-scale intifada, and rule the #WestBank.  #Abbas is finished.  Time for, #Israel, #Jordan, and #Egypt to take this possibility seriously.
The @UN and NGOs that target Israel disproportionately have argued for decades that #Israel is an apartheid state.  We welcome the latest report produced by @NGOmonitor and its advisors. 
"Azerbaijan: The Weak Link in Efforts to Pressure Iran?" (my latest in @19_forty_five).    Some in the West believe #Azerbaijan stands w/#Israel &amp; the US against #Iran. The reality is @presidentaz plays both sides:    @AEIfdp #Armenia

@BDSmovement #Israel's colonisation of #Palestine continues with the west playing lip service to the fake peace process which is being used to deflect attention away from #IsraeliTerrorism. There should be no more peace talks until Israel has been punished and its warcrimes have stopped. #BDS
