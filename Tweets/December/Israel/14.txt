Lest we not forget the reason #evangelicals (a.k.a. alleged followers of #Jesus) are so concerned is because that's where the #Apocalypse is supposed to start.  Not to mention all the group travel to #Israel is a #cashcow for church travel agencies who are tied into Israeli biz.

So, at the same time the US #Biden Admin is trying to re-engage #Iran on the nuclear deal, they are seeking to handicap #Israel from ability to defend itself from this very same flawed agreement?
