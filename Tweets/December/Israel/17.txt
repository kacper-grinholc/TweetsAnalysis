if you‚Äôre really serious about experiencing Christmas without flying to the red countries of Europe, I recommend visiting Nazareth ‚Äì the Lower Galilee city with the largest Christian community in Israel.  #Israel | #Christmas | #Christian

@seerosen_ Thanks.I agree if #Iran decides to acquire nuclear weapons we will learn to live w it as e.g. #India, #Pakistan-&amp; #Israel. But I'm not persuaded that on any scenario, #JCPOA or not, #Iran is determined to proceed to weaponization. There are advantages to staying "threshold."

It's been 24 hours since @ryangrim debunked @RepJoshG's outlandish accusations against @DAWNmenaorg &amp; @WorkingFamilies &amp; yet his website still has them up. It's clear his claims of antisemitism &amp; terror are just designed to shield #Israel from critique.
