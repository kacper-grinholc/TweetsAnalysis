#israel   The Hamas Charter in its Preamble calls unambiguously for the destruction of Israel:     Israel will exist and will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.  Tutu, The Puddings ready!!

#Palestinians were given 63% of the British mandate land in what is now called Jordan. They were offered an additional 24% when the British left, but chose instead to dedicate their lives to ensuring that the 13% that was #Israel should not exist. #Free#Israel
#Israel Strikes #Gaza after Gunfire Wounds Civilian near Fence 
#Israel  Tutu never understood that the ‚Äúcause of the Palestinian people‚Äù was the destruction of the Jewish state, and its replacement by a 23rd Arab state. He could not possibly have read, or if he did, could not possibly have understood, either the Hamas Charter, or  PNC 1968 
@AssalRad Double standard! As per incompetent and imperialist #Blinken, #Israel is allowed to do everything but not #Russia.

Just so we are clear, "Suspending" or "freezing" Hisham's #AdministrativeDetention order ‚â† #Justice. On the contrary, it means that #Israel has decided to elude responsibility for his life. That is why he is 135 days into his #HungerStrike #FreeHisham  #Palestine #NotADemocracy

Comparing democratic #Israel to #apartheid South Africa is an #antisemitic lie. Sadly, #DesmondTutu‚Äôs bias showed how easily people who were heroic in other contexts can be led astray by intersectional myths. I explain in @JNS_org.

Benny, Go Fuck yourself, piece of dog shit.  You are not a soldier, but a traitor to the people of #Israel!
