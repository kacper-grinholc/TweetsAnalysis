Update of the #apocalypse: Avian flu killing birds in #Israel could jump to humans, warns epidemiologist 
#Israel 🇮🇱/#Syria 🇸🇾  No Confirmation yet, It could be Air defence training
#Palestinians were given 63% of the British mandate land in what is now called Jordan. They were offered an additional 24% when the British left, but chose instead to dedicate their lives to ensuring that the 13% that was #Israel should not exist. #Free#Israel
#Israel Strikes #Gaza after Gunfire Wounds Civilian near Fence 
#Israel  Tutu never understood that the “cause of the Palestinian people” was the destruction of the Jewish state, and its replacement by a 23rd Arab state. He could not possibly have read, or if he did, could not possibly have understood, either the Hamas Charter, or  PNC 1968 
@AssalRad Double standard! As per incompetent and imperialist #Blinken, #Israel is allowed to do everything but not #Russia.
#Israel 🇮🇱/#Syria 🇸🇾  Unconfirmed reports in Syria of Explosions and Assad regime AA fire in #Damascus

Just so we are clear, "Suspending" or "freezing" Hisham's #AdministrativeDetention order ≠ #Justice. On the contrary, it means that #Israel has decided to elude responsibility for his life. That is why he is 135 days into his #HungerStrike #FreeHisham  #Palestine #NotADemocracy 
🇸🇾🇮🇱 #Israel launches air strike against the port of #Latakia, #Syria, says Syria's state agency #SANA; it was the second bombing in December at a location considered key to Syrian trade
Comparing democratic #Israel to #apartheid South Africa is an #antisemitic lie. Sadly, #DesmondTutu’s bias showed how easily people who were heroic in other contexts can be led astray by intersectional myths. I explain in @JNS_org. 
Only in #Israel❤️🇮🇱 
Benny, Go Fuck yourself, piece of dog shit.  You are not a soldier, but a traitor to the people of #Israel! 
Palestinian prisoner Hisham Abu Hawash continued his hunger strike. Today is the 135th day of his hunger strike for his administrative detention. His children met him for the first time in hospital. #freepalestine🇵🇸 #israel #westbank #palestinian #middleeast #Muslims #Jews

Rabbi Soloveitchik on the #Rabbinate: "In my opinion, the rabbinate is not an institution. If it becomes an institution it might have disastrous effects as far as the future is concerned. The best example is...in the State of #Israel...such a rabbinate will disintegrate"(1/3)

@Renegade_Inc What a bizarre outburst. #alandershowitz  is an experienced lawyer, he wd beg to settle out of court, were #DesmondTutu's estate to bring a case of defamation. #Tutu compared apartheid to #Nazism, quite rightly, not #Israel.
@cconces Hi Carola, I have some about forecasting, but the most CB-related are: 1.  2.  3.   While the first is more related to the US, the others are focused on #Israel.
