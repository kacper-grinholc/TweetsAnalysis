Imagine if on the Same Day... #Russia attacked #Ukraine  #China attacked #Taiwan  #NorthKorea attacked #SouthKorea  and #Iran attacked #Israel  - #JoeBiden would be so shocked, he'd probably shit himself again... that is, if he could remember how to read the headlines.

Of course the sellout of #GoldmanSachs is reducing outlook for US GDP, they're ushering in the kingdom of the beast &amp; his mark to buy or sell 42 months after MBS confirms the covenant with #Israel soon. He was just in Arabia for #FII. He's not worthy of the name David or Solomon.
