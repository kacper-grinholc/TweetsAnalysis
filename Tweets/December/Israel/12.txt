Imagine the urgency by #ApartheidIsrael’s #terrorists in uniform to find &amp; punish the perpetrators if they suspected they were #Palestinians &amp; not #settlers. Apologists for #Israel think #Apartheid does not apply to it. It does, so does #settlercolonialism, #racism &amp; #occupation.

THE BEGINNING OF THE END WILL START WHEN PRINCE MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN CONFIRMS THE COVENANT WITH #ISRAEL. WE ARE GETTING VERY CLOSE. THAT IS WHY ALL THE MADNESS IS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. THE SON OF PERDITION WILL ASCEND 42 MONTHS AFTER COVENANT CONFIRMATION. #AMEN #666

Know this, if MBS confirms the covenant with #Israel next year, the middle of the 70th week will be in 2025 &amp; the verse that comes to pass in the middle of the 70th week will have a number in #gematria that speaks of the year it comes to pass in + #666. Time will tell. #LastDays 
It's so easy for #US #UK #Israel etc to bomb civilians and face no consequences

A strong statement. To avoid accusations of #hypocrisy, why don’t you threaten #Israel, who has already been occupying #Palestine for decades with the same response unless it ends its actual ‘temporary’ occupation? Why was t that #occupation discussed and action threatened?  
#Israel has also reportedly pressured US not to sell the F-35 to #UAE over similar concerns. Leaving aside the substantive arguments, why weren't these long term issues ironed ironed during the #AbrahamAccords talks and shortly thereafter? The optics are embarrassing for all.

#FoxNews just cannot be trusted.  Changing the newsreader doesn't change the fact that @FoxNews is run by#Zionist @rupertmurdoch for #Zionist #Israel just as the #NewsoftheWorld forced to close in #UK was! 
A major #Ezekiel38and39/#GogOfMagog war update:   #Russia calls #Israel "the problem" in Middle East, defends #Iran and its allies 
Sooner or later #UAE is going to have to make a choice between #Iran, which is fully dedicated to its #Khomeinist Revolution, and its alliance with #Israel, which views #Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons as an existential threat.

Israel's "historic visit" to the #UAE. #Israel  
Thousands of #artists &amp; #scholars pledged to #boycott #apartheid #Israel this year alone. No wonder Israel's far-right regime is desperate to use #MissUniverse to polish its tarnished image.  #BoycottMissUniverse2021! #MissUniverse2021 
Former Miss Iraq @RealSarahIdan has been visiting Israel over the last few days. She was recently at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.  "Going to miss my favorite city in #Israel: Jerusalem."   We ❤️ you, Sarah! Thank you for standing with Israel and standing up to hate!

#Israel-haters are saying that the sophisticated new barrier proves that the #Gaza Strip is an “open-air prison.” I explain in @JNS_org that they ignore that it was made necessary because of Hamas terror and intransigence.
