Hi 👋 Archbishop @JustinWelby, I saw what you said about Christians in Israel…so as an Arab Christian who lives in Israel, and as the son of a priest, allow me to clarify for you: the only place in the Middle East that Christianity is growing is #Israel.  
Ambassador of #Israel in #Ukraine in the latest interview re #Antisemitism: "We would like these crimes to be classified under a new article of the law, which precisely defines what crimes motivated by anti-Semitism are, as opposed to hooliganism or some other violations of law" 
The Christian commmnity in #Israel continues to (happily) grow.  Being an inclusive democratic state means that people of different backgrounds - Jews, Muslims, and Christians - live peacefully and contribute to the diversity of Israel’s population.
