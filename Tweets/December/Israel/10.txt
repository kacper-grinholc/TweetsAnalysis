@Shiraanani @MayaMurful @MiddleEastEye #Israel is not a #Jewish state, it doesn't abide by Jewish laws &amp; rules. For a state to be a religious state, it must abide by its respective religion's laws. #Israeli authorities kill Palestinians, steal their homes &amp; land, &amp; oppresses the weak, which is opposite of Jewish laws.
@MayaMurful @Shiraanani @MiddleEastEye Right of return of the people of #Palestine. Not squatters in "#Israel", residents of Palestine that were kicked out by #Zionist militias in 1948 from their land. The real squatters are zionists that moved to occupied Palestine in 1940's &amp; invaded land that was not theirs.
@Shiraanani @MayaMurful @MiddleEastEye I already read Adalah website. That's why I posted it, because it makes sense &amp; speaks truth as to what #Israel is doing to oppress the #Palestinian people in Israel. @TimesofIsrael is a #Israeli website which is hellbent on defending Israelis &amp; encourages murder of Palestinians.

Understanding the #Israel-#Poland standoff over the Holocaust - opinion 
US and #Israel to give #Iran one week before conducting joint training exercises to prepare for possible strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, in the event that negations are unsuccessful. This doesn't mean the US is going to jump into striking Iran any time soon. 
There are reports that Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov's visit to #Israel and his planned visit to the Middle East has been cancelled and postponed to an unknown date
#Israel study shows Covid19 infection rate for vaccinated people is 138.4 times that of those w #NaturalImmunity having had Covid.  Yet #Biden Admin, #CDC, #Fauci &amp; #Media continue to ignore those w NI &amp; treat as unvaxd.  Purely political ! 
Former President Donald Trump lashed out with profanity at Benjamin Netanyahu for congratulating President Joe Biden on his victory in last year’s election, an Israeli newspaper reported Friday.  #StarvisionNews #DonaldTrump #Netanyahu #UnitedStates #Israel 
Channel 13 in #Israel reports the US is giving #Iran one final week to see where the negotiations go, and the US has agreed to hold joint training sessions with the IDF for strikes against #Iran nuclear facilities. If true, it's the closest to a deadline I've seen to date. 
Marc DeSantis and @Clogfather1975 thought we'd have a chat about #BarKokhba, the man, my new book, and what made the subject special for me. Listen to the @ancientwarfare #podcast here (free)! #Twitterstorians #History #Israel #RomanHistory
In addition to reports of a joint US-Israeli exercise, there is information that the US has issued a final one-week ultimatum to negotiate with Iran to see where it goes. 2/2 #Israel #Iran #US
Another interesting report related to the Northeast sector or the Third Circle: according to sources on Channel 13, the US gave the green light to Israel to begin a joint exercise of the two armies (with an emphasis on AF's) ahead of a future attack on Iran. 1/2 #Israel #Iran #US
To many Israelis and Gulf-state Arabs, the Abraham Accords are a historic fulcrum for peace. But to some Americans, the accords are viewed with suspicion, an imposition by former president Trump on the Middle East.  @Starrlord89 | #Israel | #US | #Gulf

🇱🇧🇸🇦🇪🇬 #Hezbollah's missiles can now reach as far as #SaudiArabia and #Egypt.  🇮🇷🚨🇮🇱 The #Iran-backed terrorist organization is a threat not just to #Israel, but to the entire Middle East and North Africa. 
The United States and #Israel need to be held responsible for their #WarCrimes.
"Reached for comment by Newsweek, an #Israel Defense Forces official confirmed that the Israeli military was preparing to conduct operations abroad in response to developments concerning #Iran." 
#GhislaineMaxwell &amp; #JeffreyEpstein were   meeting w/ &amp; extracting really sensitive information from scientists &amp; eminent theorists. That material - more than the #blackmail material - is what really would be of interest to a foreign power such as #Israel. 
Today #israel spying on #Palestinians. Tomorrow your govt spying on you. #surveillance #technology How Israel turned Palestine into a surveillance tech dystopia  
For every #occupation apologist &amp; resistance objectionist, #Lebanon resisted Zionists while #Syria didn't, today South Lebanon is free while Golan Heights were officially annexed. Egyptian Sinai was freed through force 2. #Israel only understands the language of violence!

Some 16 Israeli teens arrived in Dubai earlier this week to work with their Emirati peers to find solutions to the issue of water scarcity in the region, in a first-of-its-kind event. Here's how it went:   @shirasilkoff | #Israel | #Dubai | #Water  
#Israeli media :#US has agreed to hold joint training sessions with #Israel for attacks on #Iran's nuclear facilities
The western media is too busy bashing #Israel to pay any attention to the plight of Christians in the middle-east. The only safe country for #Christians in the middle-east is democratic, law abiding, multicultural, multiracial Israel. 
The prince has concluded his #GCC tour and continued showing his top status in the gulf region. Soon he will join some of his member states in joining the #AbrahamAccords with #Israel, but the key difference is, he has the number #666 to his name &amp; will start the last days. #MBS 
Israeli solar farm maintenance company #SolarDrone and drone maker #Airobotics have teamed up to solve this problem by developing drones that will clean solar panels. #Israel 🇮🇱🇮🇱 
#Israel will develop autonomous drones to clean solar farms located in hard-to-reach areas  Solar cells collect dust, dirt and debris as they are often located on rooftops or in hard-to-reach areas and are usually difficult to clean.

Tanzania on Thursday celebrated its 60th year of independence from Great Britain. It forged diplomatic relations with Israel in 1964, but severed them during the 1973 Yom Kippur War and reestablished only in 1995.  @tovahlazaroff | #Tanzania | #Israel  
⭕️👆: Meanwhile, nuclear #Israel is working on many fronts to invite escalation with #Iran, in a bid to get allies involved in its military-strike scenario against Iranian nuclear sites.
#Israel has completed the construction of the #Gaza CONCENTRATION CAMP to ensure the slow death and genocide of 2M ppl living in poverty, no power, no drinking water, no meds, with 1M children among them. #CollectivePunishment in all measures. #EndIsraeliImpunity #SaveGaza
