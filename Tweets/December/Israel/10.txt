@Shiraanani @MayaMurful @MiddleEastEye #Israel is not a #Jewish state, it doesn't abide by Jewish laws &amp; rules. For a state to be a religious state, it must abide by its respective religion's laws. #Israeli authorities kill Palestinians, steal their homes &amp; land, &amp; oppresses the weak, which is opposite of Jewish laws.
@MayaMurful @Shiraanani @MiddleEastEye Right of return of the people of #Palestine. Not squatters in "#Israel", residents of Palestine that were kicked out by #Zionist militias in 1948 from their land. The real squatters are zionists that moved to occupied Palestine in 1940's &amp; invaded land that was not theirs.

Former President Donald Trump lashed out with profanity at Benjamin Netanyahu for congratulating President Joe Biden on his victory in last year‚Äôs election, an Israeli newspaper reported Friday.  #StarvisionNews #DonaldTrump #Netanyahu #UnitedStates #Israel 
Channel 13 in #Israel reports the US is giving #Iran one final week to see where the negotiations go, and the US has agreed to hold joint training sessions with the IDF for strikes against #Iran nuclear facilities. If true, it's the closest to a deadline I've seen to date.
