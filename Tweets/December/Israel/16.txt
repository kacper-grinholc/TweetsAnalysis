#IDF #Israel @IDF: OPERATIONAL UPDATE: Shots were just fired at Israeli civilians in Judea and Samaria. Those injured in the attack are now receiving medical treatment at the scene.   Our troops are currently searching for the suspected terrorists. 
At least a dozen bullets holes can be seen on the car that was traveling in the northern West Bank, following the attack that killed one. #Israel #BreakingNews  
A new @amprog report by @Katulis &amp; Peter Juul calls on the #US to launch an inclusive regional diplomatic initiative that builds on #Israel-Arab normalization to advance Israeli-#Palestinian peace, also through an updated Arab Peace Initiative  
The world conflicts, #Iran-#Israel, #China-#Taiwan, #Russia-#Ukraine are all managing to to pick sides such as Russia and China, and Israel and Ukraine. Honestly this is uncomfortable. 
#Israel üáÆüá±/#Gaza üáµüá∏  Hamas published a statement praising tonight's shooting attack in the West Bank that left one Israeli dead and others injured. 
I noticed a lot of anti #Israel propagandists using the term "Zionist colonialism". To remind them that the original colonizers were the Arabs, and that Jews are indigenous to the land and have returned home. If you can't deal with that, kindly fuck off.
And of course, this man is a huge disappointment for his own role in mainstreaming sensationalized #Violence on the #videogames market. When will anybody realize that too? #gamergate #moonbats #MortalKombat11 #sadism #boycottmortalkombat #comicsgate #edboon #History #Israel
