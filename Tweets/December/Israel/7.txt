The Zionists are such wonderful colonizers that they managed to colonize exactly zero colonies outside of their indigenous homeland #Israel.
The #Syrian military is accusing Israel of an airstrike on the coastal city of Latakia.  Israel's strike on the Latakia port is highly irregular due to the Russian military base that’s nearby, since #Israel has a close relationship with Moscow and tries not to step on their toes. 
Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip have threatened to implement a gradual escalation against #Israel if their demands are not met concerning reconstruction and the blockade on #Gaza.
