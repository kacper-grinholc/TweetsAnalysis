Beautiful! This week, #Christmas cheer was brought to children with cancer at Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospital. Gifts were given to both children and staff, who are from Christian, Jewish and Muslim backgrounds. This is #Israel! 🇮🇱🎅🏽🎁  📷 @IsraelArabic/@… 
Please tweet #SaveSheikhJarrah!! Help stop #Israel's ethnic cleansing this Christmas!! #IsraeliApartheid #IsraelCrimes 
Until it's about #Israel.... 
Another video posted by #Iranian sources showing #Iran's military drill aimed increasing tension with #Israel 
(1/2) This reminds #Christmas service a few years ago when a seminarian called #Christ a #Palestinian #Jew. That #snowflake wanted to promote his anti-#Israel point of view. Let's just say that I able to control myself and not climb the pulpit to smack the little shit.

@Count58368003 @mancbluejoo @Catheri74731631 @mikopeled So why do most #Jews not live in #Israel? #Zionism is a 19th century political ideology whereas #Judaism is a 3000 year old religion. You don't have to be a #Zionist to be a #Jew. Nothing in #Judaism says #Jews should live or have their own state in the land of #Canaan.
The so called two state solution is immoral and unrealistic. Your narrative includes "just." Everything #ISRAEL did and does is just in regards to territory 
#Iran's largest military drills underway as a show of force aimed increasing tension with #USA and #Israel . Earlier today dozens of ballistic missiles were also tested. 
The bad thing about #Iran is that they have the money, weapons, and personnel to wage a #war. But they waste their time with #Propaganda.  That's why she doesn't take #Israel seriously either. 
Supposedly this is the target that was simulating #Israel’s Nuclear Site, Dimona, as part of #Iran’s exercise. If it is/was the actual target, no wonder it got successfully destroyed by the combined drones and missile strikes.   Looks like a non-reinforced concrete earth nipple. 
@SaraLBennett60 I know for a fact that many Israelis 🇮🇱 work in the National Health System.  Is their glaring omission just another "Honest Mistake"?  I'll let you be the judge of that...   #NHS #Israel

Donald Trump, eat your heart out, if you have one. #Israel has done to #Gaza what you wanted to do here but failed. This $1.1bn iron wall, the world’s largest, epitomizes what beseiged Palestinians have always called Gaza: an open-air prison.
