@ananavarro Why does it take a person who suffered through apartheid to be able to advocate against another one happening in Palestine? He and Mandela spoke out in favor of a free &amp; independent Palestine. A true freedom fighter supporting other freedom fighters. RIP #Tutu #Palestine #Israel

@bbc I'm tired of your anti #Israel and anti #Jew narrative. You misreport terrorist incidents. You make a point of featuring settlement expansion in the #GolanHeights  You fail to mention #DesmondTutu and his #Antisemitism

Israel haters repeat the lie of ‚Äòapartheid‚Äô because they can get away with it. Israeli-Arabs have more rights than any Arab in mid-east. #Palestinians have very few human rights in the territories but that is because they are governed by the tyrannical #Hamas &amp; PA..#Israel 
"How can this double standards on nuclear proliferation be justified to anyone?" ... How? Ha! Ha! Ha! Have you ever heard of #AIPAC, #Israel's lobby in the U.S.?

@jeremycorbyn 'I wish I could keep quiet about plight of the #Palestinians. I can't!' ‚ÄúWhat's being done to the Palestinians at checkpoints,for us, it's the kind of thing we experienced in South Africa." Shame he didn‚Äôt also see end of #Israel apartheid RIP #DesmondTutu
