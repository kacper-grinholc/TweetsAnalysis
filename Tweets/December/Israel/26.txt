"For years, discrimination against #Palestinian-Americans entering #Israel has been a main obstacle against Israel’s joining the program, under which citizens of approved countries can stay in the #US for up to 90 days if they meet certain requirements."
Full video of the speech given by the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu in Cape Town during the pro-#Palestine protest. It must be noted that he said multiple times that he is not anti-#Jewish but he is against #Israel’s oppression. #Palestine #RIPDesmondTutu

4/Those who are oblivious and ignorant are probably thinking “oh but why is Yishai so contemptuous”  In short; I gather it’s because #DesmondTutu was 💯 NOT oblivious to the situation in #palestine and #Israel  Yes Tutu is #SouthAfrica he lived #apartheid and know it’s appearance 
@abierkhatib #Zionism is the belief in the right of #Israel to exist. #Antizionism is inherently #antisemitic in that it denies that right. As history has shown, without a county, we Jews are forever at risk of being wiped out.

@ananavarro Why does it take a person who suffered through apartheid to be able to advocate against another one happening in Palestine? He and Mandela spoke out in favor of a free &amp; independent Palestine. A true freedom fighter supporting other freedom fighters. RIP #Tutu #Palestine #Israel

@bbc I'm tired of your anti #Israel and anti #Jew narrative. You misreport terrorist incidents. You make a point of featuring settlement expansion in the #GolanHeights  You fail to mention #DesmondTutu and his #Antisemitism

Israel haters repeat the lie of ‘apartheid’ because they can get away with it. Israeli-Arabs have more rights than any Arab in mid-east. #Palestinians have very few human rights in the territories but that is because they are governed by the tyrannical #Hamas &amp; PA..#Israel 
"How can this double standards on nuclear proliferation be justified to anyone?" ... How? Ha! Ha! Ha! Have you ever heard of #AIPAC, #Israel's lobby in the U.S.? 
My #Diabetes sick mom 67 aged, is the only 1 of my German relatives who help me. My relatives from overseas, #USA #Canada #Israel and friends from #China South Korea #Japan try to help me to leave Germany forever. Since 10.1994 enough @bundesrat bully vs me. My ideas r mine. 3/3
@jeremycorbyn 'I wish I could keep quiet about plight of the #Palestinians. I can't!' “What's being done to the Palestinians at checkpoints,for us, it's the kind of thing we experienced in South Africa." Shame he didn’t also see end of #Israel apartheid RIP #DesmondTutu
