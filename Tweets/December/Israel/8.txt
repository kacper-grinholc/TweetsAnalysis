An Israeli woman was brutally stabbed while walking with her children in #Jerusalem today.  Why? Because she's Jewish.  We are horrified by this act of violence and by the lack of coverage of the constant terror attacks against Jews – both in #Israel and around the world.

@keller_lind @irinatsukerman_ @orchardcitygal Just being on their soil give them the right to arrest him ? I'm asking because idk really. What would your nation do if that citizen was from #Israel or #USA itself? I don't wanna  to engage in argument  I just wanna know.

#Israel #Negev  Assertive action will bring peace to the Negev 
We remember Golda Meir, Israel's 🇮🇱 first and only woman prime minister, who passed away #OTD 43 years ago.  A teacher, a politician, a stateswoman and a staunch defender of #Israel &amp; Zionism, she was one of the great women in Jewish history.  May her memory always be a blessing. 
This is the #lynching that happened the other day in #Raanana #Israel .... In this insane world we are living in right now, the victims - and not the perpetrators - are under house arrest. This must change. 
#israel, if they can have a press conference without press, consider Palestine already liberated :) 
🚨From @James_J_Marlow, #Israel correspondent: @gantzbe leaving tomorrow for Washington for talks on #Iran. Channel 11 reporting IAF training exercises are now taking place to fly 1,000 miles.  In a new poll, the majority of Israelis support striking Iran without approval of US.
@IDF Thank you #Israel🇮🇱🇮🇳.. Thanks very much for your kind support and standing with us during the difficult😣😖😫😭 time

Elbit Systems is developing the 155-mm SIGMA truck-mounted howitzer to replace the #Israel army’s aging M109 self-propelled guns. It has also received an export contract for the system from an unnamed Asian country. #WeaponWednesday   
Not only ordinary #Hindus &amp; #Christians but #celebrities R persecuted in #Pakistan. Congress denies but being her original #children or #flesh shouldn't India give them #home like #Israel does to #Jews  arti  
This is a racist and destructive policy by #Israel gov, which adds fuel to the fire of hate.
