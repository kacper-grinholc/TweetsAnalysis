Solution for Israel-Palestine Conflict     The idea is for there to be a city of rental properties in the West Bank. This city would only have properties to rent and not buy. Israelis could live in the West Bank without making settlements. #Israel #Palestine
'#Israel' never had any evidence that would support its claims on #Palestinian NGO's, if anything, the lack of evidence is, in itself, evidence that Israel creates myths to use as justification of its actions to drive #Palestinians out of their homeland.
