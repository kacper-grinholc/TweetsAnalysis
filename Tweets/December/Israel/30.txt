#IDF #Israel @IDF: An Israeli civilian, who consciously crossed the Blue Line from Israel into Lebanon a few weeks ago, was returned to Israel tonight.  Israeli security officials monitored the issue throughout &amp; the man was returned in a joint operation‚Ä¶ 
@soitiz @MxRevenge1 The PA has no authority.  Abbas' mandate expired and they did not hold elections, because #Israel did not want, knowing that there would be no zio servants elected.
@Ostrov_A Sad. Hopefully with the #AbrahamAccords and the recent tilt of #Qatar towards #Israel Iran could be outnumbered.
So important to work through these issues in a safe and meaningful way.  üíôüáÆüá±üíô #Israel

It is about time the United Nations live up to the lofty principles it was founded upon and investigate some of the  venerable members of the Human Rights Council, rather than the lone Jewish state. #Israel  
‚ÄúOut of one of them came another horn (#Assad‚Äôs #Syria), which started small but grew in power to the south (#SouthAmerican &amp; #African regions) and to the east (#China, *#MiddleEast/#Arabs*, #Russia) and toward the Beautiful Land (#Israel).‚Äù - Daniel 8:9
