@dankogaion Your statement is wrong historically and under international law. The Soviet Union no longer exists. Since 1991 #Ukraine with #Crimea is a sovereign state. Crimea is territory of #Ukraine. For details about all aspects see:  (easy to translate with Google)
Prison, repression, discrimination against #Crimea #Tatars since #Russian annexation of #Ukraine territory seven years ago: fate of Crimean Tatars one of top issues at Monday’s inaugural meeting of the #CrimeanPlatform, an international summit called by Ukraine. 
.@Denys_Shmyhal and @VDombrovskis discussed the introduction of an "industrial visa-free regime"  Details:  #Ukraine #Kabmin #EU #Trade 
Merkel said that "gas should not be used as a geopolitical weapon" during her visit to Kyiv. But this normative approach 1) is not sincere in a high risk case and 2) not based on facts, given the past behavior. Actions vs discourse.  #Ukraine  
Crimean Tatars bemoan their plight as #Ukraine hosts summit  new 'Platform' is an effort to mobilize international support to end the Russian occupation, here focusing on a deported Muslim people group

There are no guarantees. Wait for no one #Ukraine.   It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission for Ukraine's own strategic interests.   Learn from before, do not live in the past.   Assume no one is coming to help. Assume no one has your interests before theirs. 
In the coming weeks, 🇺🇦 may receive the second tranche of #EU’s macro-financial assistance. #Ukraine has fulfilled all the necessary conditions to receive €600 million. Talked over the issue with @VDombrovskis. The second tranche is a clear message of solidarity with Ukraine.

“A member and acting head of #Ukraine’s Gambling &amp; Lottery Regulatory Commission was arrested on suspicion of receiving a $90,000 bribe to grant gambling licenses.” There is info that Hetman is the serving SBU officer.   Is it the SBU employee’s habit of extorting bribes?

Zhovkva is a picturesque town located in the north of Lviv Oblast in western #Ukraine. Its central part has the status of a historical and architectural reserve. In total, there are more than 50 monuments of world, national and regional significance here  
#Ukrainian plane with 83 evacuees from Afghanistan arrives in Kyiv #Ukraine is a war tortured country - but has more #humanity than #Austria What a shame.

If Germany took #Ukraine's security concerns seriously, why isn't there a #Bundeswehr presence in the country? Why aren't there German military trainers in Yavoriv training centre? Why is Germany undermining the Normandy Format by siding with Russia?

This is rich. The same woman who pressed so hard for Nord Stream 2 so that Russian gas could bypass #Ukraine now acts like she cares about Ukraine's energy security. Spare me, Chancellor.

"Ready to support"? If #Russia "uses #nordstream2 as a weapon" (i.e. invades wider #Ukraine not fearing transit disruption), it will be too late for The #Germany statehood: there'd be no excuses for the latter's existence left.

#Ukraine sees the soon-to-be completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline carrying #Russian gas to Europe as “a dangerous geopolitical weapon”, President Volodymyr Zelensky says.

Translation: #Ukraine is going to lose a lot of money (although possibly not as much as they fear, since they seem to be panicking they'll lose it all)

Good but controversial news. It's unclear why on Earth  were #Ukraine troops making sorties out of the #Kabul_Airport. To rescue Afghans?! It's not like we got no phukin war to fight at home.

#Ukraine 🇺🇦 and #Georgia 🇬🇪 are further strengthening relations. Grateful to @GharibashviliGe for a rich dialogue on economics, trade, transport, energy &amp; security. Ukraine aims to prolong developing a strategic partnership with Georgia to achieve our shared goals. 
#Ukraine :Aircraft with 83 people evacuated from #Afghanistan lands in #Kiev - President’s #Zelensky office 
People who think that #Russia's invasion of #Ukraine is solely a Ukraine's problem need to think twice. In occupied #Crimea Russia's now built a powerful military base that can shoot as far as at the British Isles and Spain. 
"I like it when the West come up with new #sanctions on some lowly phukin nobodies in the FSB, carefully omitting the top figures, and then immensely pride themselves in resisting Kremlin": #Ukraine journo and mother on the #doublestandards in answering #Russia's global invasion 
Met with core anti-corruption institutions of #Ukraine. Discussed the main challenges of the fight against corruption.   The EU continues to strongly support the independence and effective functioning of 🇺🇦 anti-corruption institutions.
