@olgatokariuk “No #US support” has always been understood by modern #Ukraine. #Obama jumped at the opportunity to say it to #Putin at the first sight of the #Russian invasion (leaving the latter in no doubt) while mouthing he is “deeply concerned”. But the UPA was deluded about US help in 1945

Europe should take this to heart. Ukraine in particular might want to speed up reforms. "American support should never be taken for granted and cannot continue endlessly for countries that prove unwilling or unable to use it properly." #Ukraine #Europe

@MattiMaasikas @Biz_Ukraine_Mag @getmalyona #Ukraine always had Hetmans not “Getmans”. What a massacre of a proud #Ukrainian surname.
