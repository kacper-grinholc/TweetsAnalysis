Meanwhile, #Ukraine pleads on bender knee for weapons with which do defend itself against Russian forces militarily unlawfully occupying Ukrainian territory since 2014. Russia’s illegal war of aggression instead gets green lighted and funded through projects like #NordStream2. 
I'm sorry Afghanistan is falling, but I can't pretend to be surprised in any way, shape, or fashion. What does astonish me is the hubris and arrogance of the idiot that put us there in the first place. #Imbecile #Bush And please, don't get me started on Putin's eyes. #Ukraine

The relief that #JoeBiden isn't #Trump is huge. But the way Biden has abandoned ordinary Afghanis (not #Afghanistan the state) to the Taliban and #Ukraine (#NordStream2) to #Russia is actually shocking. Not being Trump isn't enough. The undue haste of the US retreat is indecent.
