There are decent people left in #Odessa who no longer support policies of #Zelensky in #Ukraine. #Police are looing for unknown suspect(s) who hang several big banners with words "Zelensky is a d*ckhead" on the day of 30th #Independence of Ukraine. I don't like vulgarity, but... 
In a weird way #NordStream2 might end up helping #Ukraine, because it lead this great sovereign nation to push harder for its natural geographic, cultural &amp; value-based right to join the #EU. #Germany has to put politics front&amp;center and welcome Kyiv with open arms! Forget Russia
#Ukraine FM Kuleba is right. Ukraine is part of #Europe, it should join #EU+#NATO. #Russia under #Putin is hopelessly stagnating/sliding! If not for its continued military aggression, Russia would be entirely dismissable.  It is time for broader #EuropeanIntegration of the East.
#Zelensky allows #FarRight, pro #nazi thugs aka "activists" to march during #IndependenceDay celebrations throughout #Ukraine. This is #Odessa. You can see radicals, nationalists freely marching with a radical banner like "Ukraine or Death"  Is that what #EU &amp; #NATO wants?

minus any authority in the international arena; minus the desire of young people here to give birth to children; minus half the birth rate. Clearly, lots of minuses for #Ukraine during 30 years of #Independence. What are the pluses according to Ukrainian journalist Goldarb?

In the men's #3x3 competition, 44 points scored and 20 conceded signalled a perfect start for #Ukraine, and in the women's tournament the #UnitedStates showed why it holds the title with two dominant performances against #Belarus and #Slovenia  @FIBA3x3  
Today, #Ukraine celebrated 30 years of #IndependenceDay. Let me do posts of #Ukrainian journalist Maxim Goldarb who summarized main stats, events for Ukraine's 30 years of independence. You might agree or disagree, but he is pretty much right on the money. Sad reality for Ukraine
@shaunwalker7 True! Is that bad or good? Well, it depends. Tradition is good, but what is bad that #Ukraine for 30 years didn't do much to improve military infrastructure. Some radicals claim well Ukraine has a war with Russia, no time or money. But what Ukraine did in 23 years before 2014?
Note total absence of mention of #Europe except as battleground (#Ukraine). Is it a given Europe w partner an increasingly #undemocratic #US against a more-Eastern-focussed #RU? Also, posited concert of powers RU/#CN/US carries risk rising rearmed #EU bloc could become the target
#Baiul wasn't invited by #Zelensky to celebrate 30th #IndependenceDay of #Ukraine. After all, she won the 1st ever #gold medal in the history of #OlympicGames for Ukraine. She decided to become #USA citizen. She considers herself as #Jewish after learning her mother was Jewish
#Ukraine’s #independence #celebration: shadowed by insecurity 
Oksana #Baiul was the first #Olympic #champion for #Ukraine in any sport. Today, she published this post on #IndependenceDay "If you are not loved, do not beg for love. If they don't believe you, don't make excuses. If you are not appreciated, do not prove it." #figureskaing 
So ... if #Biden and the adults can't handle the #Taliban in #Afghanistan ... how will they do when #China takes #Taiwan and #Russia finishes off #Ukraine? An iron curtain of idiocy has decended upon the white house.

@kooleksiy #Happy #IndependenceDay to you. Anyway, look who was at the #parade today in #Ukraine. The leader of neo #nazi group C14 Yevhen #Karas. He was in red tshirt. How is that acceptable for civilized world to observe how freely nazi are participating in parade? Disgusting! 
" #Ukraine is dividing its population by turning the use of two similar languages into a point of political dispute." 
Clearly, #Zelensky is doing everything to abuse, to humiliate major minority in Ukraine - the Russians and Russian speaking citizens of #Ukraine.  The #segregation of Russian-speaking and national minorities as a whole will continue in Ukraine.

Two years ago, #Zelensky cancelled #military #parade for #IndependenceDay claiming it was very expensive for #Ukraine. This year he personally orchestrated parade, including military parade with Soviet made tanks just little bit modernized. It's a political stunt for his campaign

@GilCividanes That is so wonderful for Julia! #Ukraine has been in such a difficult state for so long. Wishing the best for her family.
During celebration of 30th anniversary of #IndependenceDay in #Ukraine, #Zelensky totally ignored Soviet achievements of Ukrainians within USSR. He claimed Ukraine will reclaim lost territories, cultural artifacts lost abroad. Great ambitions, with low expectation of an outcome.

@LevHavryliv Actually, each things or action are complete differ between #Ukraine and #Terrorrusia.  F.e., traditional folk costumes or instruments like Bandura (up to 70 strings and Balalajka only 3 strings)

@senrobportman I thought you were all about #Ukraine ?   Where were you 
@LevHavryliv #Ukraine even during #USSR period celebrated Easter and X-mass (of course it was forbidden), but ancient traditions, relative songs are live prove that #Ukraine has very deep traditions and still keeping alive and what is more important still in use!
@ChristopherJM I extend sincere &amp; warm wishes for #Ukraine. In reality, Ukraine didn't have any good decades since the fall of USSR in 1991. Economic collapse, money reform, corruption at all levels. rise of nationalism, radicals, two revolutions, war, lost territories, decrease of population
A #Ukraine serviceman is killed in action, further one is non-critically wounded in the #Russia attacks in #Donbas earlier today: UA JFO military press service's evening bulletin. #Ukraine30
#NATO membership would be ‘fighting talk.’ Possibly dangerous. It would risk escalation. If war resulted it would be fought in #Ukraine first. The Article V solution took the decision out of Ukraine’s hands. They were in whether they liked it or not. Read:

Nothing to see here, move on  "European values" in #Zelensky's #Ukraine   In the building of the former synagogue there is a coffee shop with symbols of the Nazi SS   
@LevHavryliv Pan Koc'kyj (Cat men) prototype of social network rumors Telesyk - about boy who escape from death etc.  So actually each #Ukraine tales about desired Freedom, while #Terrorrussia about dependence from other or laziness or dumbness or lie
The "hijacking" of a Ukrainian plane from #Kabul by #Taliban turned out to be a machination of bribed pilots.  #Ukraine #Afghanistan #Iran  
@LevHavryliv 6. Soul of each folk laid in own tales #Terorrussia  Ivanushka durachok (fool) Priest and his servant Balda (dumb) Emelya tale (lazy Emelya miracle action) etc.  #Ukraine   Mykola kozhumyaka (leather processing craftsmen) which killed by his own Evil Snake to save #Kyiv
Surely #America is more of a hot bed of terrorism than any other country.  It finances resistance movements around the world, particularly in communist countries or in countries pointed out by #Israel. #Cuba, #Venezuela, #Ukraine, #Yemen, #Afghanistan, #Syria and how many more? 
#Vovkovinskiy was a Soviet Ukrainian born. He left #Ukraine when he was 7. He had a heart condition and was indeed very, very tall. He even appeared in several Hollywood movies and also participated for Ukraine at #Eurovision. He was a big supported of president #Obama. #RIP 
@njaresko in the news for possible #US advisory role in #Ukraine. 
I stand with #Ukraine &amp; my Ukrainian friends on this day of celebrating the 30th anniversary of its independence &amp; in its struggle for integrity. Let's stop thinking of it as little Russia. It's a country in its own right &amp; culturally &amp; politically has nothing to do with #Russia. 
@Matthew_Kupfer Dream on…#Ukraine = NOT a country, just a lame duck buffer state that could be turned into a battlefield by third parties cause nobody cares.

I have a ques: if #ns2 is such a threat to EU energy security then why isn’t TurkStream the same threat? It does exactly the same thing-except it goes south of #ukraine not north. And it already cost ukr $1bn in lost transit fees. But no one ever mentions it nor the lost $1bn
@LevHavryliv What is &lt;&gt; between #Ukraine and #Terrorrussia  1 Almost all old  Ukrainian cities were under Magdeburg  Law; 2 Any old #Terrorrussia  cities were under Magdeburg Law; 3 #Ukraine fought for own Freedom; 4 #Terrorrussia fought to slave others; 5 Freedom is essential for #Ukraine
Today #Ukraine celebrates its 30th year of independence. It  is a great age for a young, independent country. This is how it began, from BBC archives.

Lately, #Zelensky's been saying a lot of relevant, interesting, but mostly controversial things on #Ukraine's defensive war with Russia . I don't tweet on them, I don't discuss them. A war leader is to decide &amp; make changes, not debate situation. As for debate, he's too shallow🐁

Russia’s foreign ministry says Russia doesn’t need to transit #gas via #Ukraine. Clear, one-finger answer to outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who recently said Russia shouldn’t use the newly built alternative gas transit route, #NordStream, as an economic “weapon.” 
@bmilakovsky @kooleksiy How is that legal for #Ukraine to #sanction a citizen of #Ukraine #Guzhva. Moreover, Mr. Guzhva has a political asylum and resides in Austria. How is that possible for #Zelensky government to target Guzhva? Guzhva should file a lawsuit against Ukraine at #EU #HumanRights court
@gpovanman in fairness, it wasn't his fault they wanted independence from #Ukraine - he was still a comedian when that happened and not much more than a school bully when the first one was requested by #Crimea and were threatened with military action, should they go ahead (1991)
