#Afghanistan #ukraine #biden #usa #trump #taliban The Taliban Has Captured a Hoard of American-Made Weapons worth 10s of Billion 💵, something btw they never gave to close allies like 🇺🇦. Now what? 
The Crimean Platform has an impressive list of participants. The inaugural summit of the platform will take place on 23 August 2021, on the eve of the 30th anniversary of Ukraine's independence. Noteworthy is that Macron, Merkel and von der Leyen will not attend. #Ukraine #Crimea 
The guy who gave #Ukraine a Tomos, the right to have an independent orthodox patriarchate independent of #Moscow. 
Digital #COVID19 #vaccination certificate of #Ukraine recognized by the #EU. A significant step forward for 🇺🇦 while #Georgia doesn't seem to care enough about rapid integration into the 🇪🇺 systems.. 
73 additional #Ukraine citizens added to #Russia sanctions list. A day after #Merkel #Moscow visit and 2 days before #CrimeaPlatform 
Report says #Russia added #Ukraine foreign minister and national security council chief to sanctions list, presumably over #CrimeaPlatform effort

Gentle #bear Kvitka 🐻 - there was a time she was forced to fight to protect herself when she lived at a #hunting station in #Ukraine. Kept in a 4m² cage for years with nothing but concrete floor.  Kvitka was rescued and arrived at our @BearsDomazhyr in June 2018.

@LindseyAGerman @IanDunt Lindsey, and who do you think is the guilty party in the #Russia #Ukraine war, or do you put it down to some kind of civil war? I would love to know.

@27khv @stranaua How can #Ukraine sanction a citizen of Ukraine who got political asylum in Austria. He should sue Ukraine at European Court for Human Rights. He'll have a good chance to win it if a court will judge it without international pressure.

This is #Kherson in south part of #Ukraine. They were trying to install the flagpole for #IndependenceDay.  It fell and crushed a car. Luckily, nobody got hurt. It was suppose to be the tallest flagpole in the region.

@ChristopherJM By the way, Ihor Huzhva was granted a political asylum in #Austria and today #Ukraine imposed #sanctions against him and his #media outlet. I think Huzhva has a great case at European Court for #HumanRights.
@ChristopherJM It's illegal to #sanction own citizens in #Ukraine. They can open criminal investigations, but to impose sanctions against own citizens is illegal. Clearly #oppostion in #Ukraine is under attack by Zelensky even more than under #Poroshenko. Major setback for #PressFreedom
