Providing some context on #Ukraine’s daring rescue of #Canada-bound Afghans, in conversation with David Common of @PnPCBC  
@AzorInfo #HongKong was once part of the #FreeWorld &amp; was still supposed 2 be partially part of it insofar as #1Country2Systems prohibited the #communist system from being introduced b4 2047. #Ukraine &amp; #Crimea? #Obama &amp; the #Dems balked on #Putin's aggression. Almost the same in #Syria.
@AzorInfo about whether the #CCP or #Kremlin invades or represses #NATO or #US treaty allies - #Chinazi &amp; #Russian expansionism is just that expansionism, eg #HongKong &amp; #Ukraine/#Crimea. Just because they are selective in their aggression doesn't change what they are - or the threat.

@joshuakern can you please not refer to #Ukraine as "the" Ukraine in your #raptors articles? Here's a little background for your information: 
Translator, who worked with #Canada, and his family rescued by #Ukraine in #Kabul. "I tried for the last month to have someone get us. We asked the Americans, the Canadians, the Qataris, everybody – and no solution. They were scared to come out." 
"The Russian defence ministry said it was evacuating more than 500 people from Afghanistan, including Russians and citizens of Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine."  #Russia #Ukraine #Canada #Afghanistan
#Ukraine sends troops outside #Kabul airport to rescue 19 Afghans destined for #Canada, with the mediation of @globeandmail's MacKinnon, then asks to join #NATO. Ukraine had citizens stranded in Kabul, rescued by #Russia. No mention of this by MacKinnon.

The new freight train route connecting #Chongqing and #Kyiv will further facilitate #China’s trade with #Ukraine and wider #Europe. 
"Ukraine deployed special forces troops into [Kabul] on foot to conduct the rescue. The evacuees said they were stunned that Ukr. troops had taken risks to save them that Cdn &amp; US forces had not." Damn! Where can I get a #Ukraine  flag?

Trump did deep damage to US-Ukraine relations. This week when meeting with @ZelenskyyUa  at the White House, @POTUS can end this dark period and begin to build a special relationship with #Ukraine. My take: 
The EU recommends halting non-essential travel from the U.S. Britain tries to define what a journalist is in its fight with #BigTech. #France makes #COVID19 health pass compulsory for close to 2 million workers. Biden to meet with #Ukraine’s President.

This is a really good list of reliable media from #Ukraine. I wish someone had given it to me in 2014 (a few of the sites didn't exist back then).  As always, use critical thinking skills when reading any media. 
💸 The #US President #JoeBiden ordered the allocation of financial assistance to #Ukraine in the total amount of $60 million from the #Pentagon in defense @InterfaxUkr  reports:

In my @nytimes @nytopinion article, I argue #NordStream2 must be stopped, what can be done to halt the project, and how the #UnitedStates can help mitigate the damage the pipeline will cause to #Ukraine’s economic, energy, and national security.

"It's significant that we in #Europe defend what #Russia attacks. With threats to #Ukraine’s sovereignty and intl. order, to put Moscow with this #pipeline in a stronger position, is, in my view, a risk, not a good signal" @MiriamKosmehl in @PromoteUkraine
On the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances #Ukraine once again calls on politicians of the democratic world, #humanrights organizations, and other public organizations, as well as the #international #media...
#Poland comments on #Zapad2021: Russia's aggression against #Ukraine also began with military exercises 
With "friends" like these, #Ukraine needs no enemies. Read the below at your own risk: it's BS, but typical BS. a) No, there is no "clear" case against Nord Stream 2, at all. b) Giving #Zelensky this kind of silly advice is basically to set him up. 
As we mark #dayofthedisappeared our colleague Kateryna from the @ICRC_ua team shares her experiences in #Ukraine supporting families whose loved ones have gone missing during the conflict

Approximately 30 #Ukraine's media outlets first reported and then removed news of a traffic accident involving alleged DUI by Oleksandr Trukhin, a Servant of the People MP.  Likely, publishers were offered monetary compensation for the removal of the news, @DetectorMedia informs.

When meeting President Zelensky, @POTUS should stress that respect for rights is key US priority &amp; central to #Ukraine's stability.  👮SBU reform should safeguard freedoms 👩‍⚖️Sign law on war crimes 👵Access to pensions for all in Eastern Ukraine  Our take:  
@markmackinnon I’m ashamed that my own government was not able to do this- and grateful for those brave soldiers from #ukraine . In an emergency it’s about agility and being committed to doing the right thing.

Interesting. Previously Head of the President’s office of #Ukraine Yermak said that all Ukrainians who wanted to leave #Afghanistan were evacuated #AfghanistanCrisis 
This is awesome. Thank you to @ZelenskyyUa, @Ukraine and her brave military members for the humanitarian help and support. These Afghan's have a chance for a better life because of you #Heros #Ukraine 
Amazing story about bravery of Ukrainian army in Kabul is yet another reminder that #Ukraine already contributes much to transatlantic security.  @NEC_Ukraine has made an excellent research "Route to membership" for #DIA_ZCC explaining what is Ukraine's engagement: 👇
