Tokyo #Paralympic medal ranking: #Azerbaijan 6, #Ukraine 5. Very impressive! 
#Russia: “#USA left more #Javelin missile systems to #Taliban terrorists than they sent to #Ukraine”
#Ukraine's Minister of #Finance stated people who are in their 40's shouldn't rely on Ukrainian government pensions when they'll be ready to #retire because it won't be any funds left. #Marchenko clarified that pension will be very little. That's why it's important to pay #taxes

Russian occupation forces in #Ukraine committed yet another #warcrime early this morning, shelling the city of Avdiivka.  #Putin commemorates UA’s 30th anniversary of restored independence by shelling civilians in their homes.  #Russia is a terrorist state.  Photos via @Yhnmko5 
The #refugees from #Afghanistan who would come to #Ukraine would stay in former jail facilities that are now on sale by #Zelensky government. Not sure, if Afghan people will be happy to stay at such unwelcoming places like these: 
This is totally insane what #Ukraine is doing. They have enough #coal supplies for the #winter needs, yet #Zelensky decided to buy 75 tons of very expensive coal from #USA. Also, Ukraine is buying coal from #Poland. Few years ago, Ukraine bought expensive coal from #SouthAfrica.
Congrats to #Russia for advancing into the final of the #FIFA #BeachSoccerWC . Let's give a credit to #Switzerland. They weren't suppose to be there. #Ukraine refused to participate because Russia was hosting the #WorldCup, so Swiss were invited and look how far they got.

Final Score from Ramp Playground  #Ukraine 7 #Kenya 0  #PHLUnityCup @phlsoccer2026
I've been regularly receiving a gentle trickle of #AutomatedScamPhoneCalls, after the #TMobile #SecurityBreach, including this odd one yesterday, that talked about #TMobile! - I googled, &amp; "32374" is the #CountryCode for #Ukraine, but could be #Spoofed? 
Another goal for #Ukraine! #7 Andrew Yakushev makes it 7-0 with 4 minutes to go against #Kenya  #PHLUnityCup @phlsoccer2026
With 20 minutes to go, a goal by #19 Brian Weinhardt puts #Ukraine ahead of #Kenya 6-0. #PHLUnityCup @phlsoccer2026
