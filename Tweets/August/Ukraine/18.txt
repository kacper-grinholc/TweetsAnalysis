Ambassador of #Israel visited #Uman #Ukraine in preparation of Orthodox #Jewish pilgrimage. #Ukrainian social media is filled with hate toward Hasidim saying: "Previous mayor protected us from covid &amp; Hasidim, but this year a swarm of Hasidic Jews already in every corner of Uman"

@edrormba Well, #Ukraine will require PCR testing on the way in and Israel will require PCR testing on the way out from Ukraine. Many are vaccinated. Ukraine has no plans to ban travel this year. Official stats in Ukraine are way lower than Israel or in US or neighboring Russia. #Uman
