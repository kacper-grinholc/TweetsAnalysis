@AlexPanchenko2 @FCDOGovUK And why is @DailyMailUK &amp; so much other #UK media so stupid, so duped by #Russian propaganda into repeating the false #Kremlin propaganda mantra of “civil war” &amp; “pro Russian rebels” in #Ukraine?

David Smith’s Ukrainian wife is a legitimate part of this story, but FFS! There are so many errors in this article (Dnipro isn’t a hotbed of separatism, the connection between Russian ancestry &amp; pro-#Russia sentiment is far, far from ironclad in #Ukraine).

The war hawks, the ‘tough-talkers’, wanted to solve the problem with the age old solution: guns. Big guns. Better guns than the #Ukrainian separatists had. And much more of them. Killing more people would achieve peace in eastern #Ukraine. Obvious innit?

@mjgranger1 Why is #Russianpropaganda agency #Interfax conducting a “press conference” in #Ukraine? Why aren’t Ukrainian officials doing this, to show it’s legit?  This smells funny.
Absolutely unacceptable behavior of some idiot.😡  Zhan must be sure that the majority of Ukrainians are proud of the Ukrainian Beleniuk, a great person &amp; athlete 🇺🇦👏 #Ukraine

@motytchak @mikercarpenter @JoeBiden @RichardHaass What a joke. This insistence that “corruption must be fixed before we provide money” did not stop the #US from blowing USD1 trillion in #Afghanistan, much higher up (more corrupt) than #Ukraine on the corruption perception index.

My final point: If the US could have gotten a "#Ukraine scenario" in #Afghanistan using money, weapons sales, joint military exercises, plus anti-corruption and development work, the War in Afghanistan would be a smashing success. But that just isn't the case. /END
While #Russia may be physically capable of conquering #Ukraine, it is politically unfeasible. Russia tried hard to hide the deaths of its troops in the Donbas. Russian forces will not march into Kyiv without facing huge numbers of casualties. (Plus far more severe sanctions.)
#Ukraine in 2021 may be a relatively weak state (if compared to the US or Germany), but it is far stronger than it was in 2014. The DNR/LNR (the Ukrainian "Taliban," if you will) just aren't capable of taking over most of the country.
Finally, the comparison between #Ukraine and #Afghanistan implies that the Ukrainian state is a protectorate of the US and can't function without it. This simply isn't true and it feeds false narratives pushed by Kremlin and pro-Kremlin media.
Getting out of Afghanistan is an issue than potentially animates many voters. Ending support for #Ukraine, by and large, isn't. In part, that's because America's support for Ukraine is quite similar to regular foreign aid.
At the same time, look at the positive outcome of UkraineGate: American support for #Ukraine remains strong and, despite it all, bipartisan. And unlike engagement in Afghanistan, it doesn't require sacrificing American lives.
It's understandable that #Afghanistan makes some in #Ukraine doubt the permanence of US support. But, if UkraineGate taught us anything, it's that shockwaves from political events in Washington can reach Kyiv. This isn't news.
The US allowing the completion of Nord Stream 2 — the biggest betrayal by Washington — just isn't comparable to the pullout from #Afghanistan. It's bad news for #Ukraine, but it won't lead to the country's collapse to DNR/LNR.
There's been some speculation about what the US pullout from #Afghanistan says about Washington's support for #Ukraine. The answer, I suspect, is "not much." It's tempting to make the comparison, but Kyiv was never wholly dependent on Washington for its own stability.
