@sandibachom Yep, shame as all roads to #Russia passed through #Bannon or @PaulManafort toll booths, and half international finance transactions likely handed to @SDNYnews by #Ukraine soon as #Insurrection failed to topple democracy, why wouldn’t he ? 
Can you still honor your commitments to #Taiwan #Ukraine &amp; all those who may be very worried that #USA won't behave like it did in #Afghanistan. USA partnered with #Talibans. Rest all is eyewash &amp; white wash. Americans can not &amp; should not treat world as fools. Ruined Afghanistan 
@ScottMStedman Guess #Guiliani forgot about his dealings with #GRU agent Konstantin #Klimnik in #Ukraine.
#Putin and Macron also discussed issues of Karabakh, Iran and #Ukraine among others and agreed to continue personal contacts.  #Italy holds the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 and is considering calling a special summit to address the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan

Thank you @USAIDInclusive - Very proud of our @cepps @IRIglobal #Ukraine team and the incredible work of these young Ukrainians 
Today, @EU_Commission adopted three adequacy decisions for #Ukraine 🇺🇦, #Turkey 🇹🇷, #NorthMacedonia 🇲🇰. This means that these countries will be connected to our system and that COVID certificates issued by them will be accepted in the 🇪🇺 under the same conditions as the EU DCC.
This week, #Ukraine received 100,000 doses of AstraZeneca COVID vaccine from Greece. And on top of that another 650,000 doses of the same vaccine from Poland and 46,000 doses from Lithuania. The drugs were provided as humanitarian aid.  This was reported by the Ministry of Health

@LifelineUkraine, the national suicide prevention hotline, is in danger of closing unless it secures long-term support &amp; funding. Since Oct. 2019, they've taken 14,216 calls or messages from people around #Ukraine in desperate need of support -  1/3
Why military parade is so important for #Ukraine? This is symbolic and material manifestation of security for every Ukrainian. These brave soldiers are the only safeguard that Ukrainians will never be killed  or occupied again,  no more #Holodomor and no more victimhood
