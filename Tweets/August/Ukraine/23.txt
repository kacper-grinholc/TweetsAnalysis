After 10 years working in #Russia, I got used to their alternative take on reality, but hard eyerolling today at some absolute crackpots. “Russia didn’t invade #Ukraine, we were invited to govern by democratic process, but what about fascist UK occupation of the Chagos Islands?”

@vtchakarova . Let's stop pretending the #USA is a benevolent #hegemon. It's elites are addicted to easy money. #NordStream2 hinders US #LNG exports and potential for kickbacks via #Ukraine. #ASML is not allowed to export to #China, so China faces challenge to produce chips. &amp; #Huawei ...
#Ukraine: President Zelensky declared that, if necessary, he will "fight a war" to reform the Constitutional Court. He claims that Ukraine can reform itself through "wars" against the old system. In April this year, he removed the constitutional judges appointed by Yanukovych⤵️
We all see what is happening in #Afghanistan. What do you think #Putin does to #Ukraine without the #UnitedStates/#EU strongly in its corner?  Hint: search “Crimea 2014”  Still don’t get it? Try “Georgia 2008” 
Foreign Minister Svetlan Stoev: #Bulgaria strongly supports #Ukraine's sovereignty

An international summit initiated by #Ukraine reaffirmed commitments to de-occupy #Crimea, seven and a half years after Russian troops occupied the strategic Black Sea peninsula. @alex_owski reports 👇
@Belbachir_Amina In Eastern Europe, really? We get completely different reactions. In fact, the solidarity with the #Ukraine is strongest in the states formerly controlled by the USSR. Only the local Putinists supported a new expansionism from #Russia. #Crimea

❗ Russia has been spreading propaganda in #Ukraine for quite a long time now.   🤓 Read our book with an analysis of the key narratives of #Russian historical #propaganda about Ukraine, comments on those narratives from Ukrainian historians:  
💬Maria #Zakharova: #Ukraine’s policy regarding #Crimea, both before 2014 &amp; afterwards, consisted of its total reluctance to hear &amp; heed the people. #Kiev did not hear the Crimeans before 2014 &amp; after Crimea’s reunification with #Russia... 🔗Find out more:
#Crimea. A referendum in a militarily occupied country, under massive intimidation, without critical election observers and with inconclusive manipulation of voter turnout and results cannot and will never be recognized by any free government. @steven_pifer #Russia #Ukraine 
#Canada - for the past six years, present where it matters in #Ukraine - in the military training field. #OpUnifier

How can #Ukraine vanquish #Russia on the #theocracy chessboard? 
Participants in the summit sent a message that #Ukraine was not alone, saying the international community would not recognise the annexation of #Crimea by #Russia, and that the purpose of the platform would be to seek a solution through joint efforts

#Azerbaijan as a state and public opinion in the country recognize #Crimea as a part of #Ukraine and do not appreciate #Russia`s occupation of the peninsula. #Crimea is #Ukraine! #Russia is occupant and must withdraw its presence from #Crimea! @crimeaplatform
Happy Flag Day #Ukraine! 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 
how badly they’ve all failed #Ukraine &amp; the people of #Crimea. How they’ve put their own national interests over European security and the people of Crimea, &amp; how they’ve either failed to hold #Russia adequately responsible or worse, cozied up to the #Kremlin for political gain
Whilst the show of support for #Ukraine at the #CrimeaPlatform is nice &amp; absolutely necessary, the diplomatic drivel that it’s producing will engage &amp; inspire precisely nobody. I know that’s not the point, but wouldn’t that be nice if they all stood up &amp; acknowledged… 
Kremlin spox Peskov complains that #CrimeaPlatform in Kyiv is "unfriendly" and "anti-Russian" event.  What did he expect?  #Russia used military force in 2014 to illegally seize Crimea from #Ukraine. Most of world regards Moscow's annexation of peninsula as illegitimate. 
Happy National Flag Day #Ukraine 🇺🇦🇹🇷

German Chancellor #AngelaMerkel offered reassurances on Sunday that #Ukraine would not suffer as a result of the Germany-Russia #NordStream2 pipeline, but Ukraine said talks about its future as a transit country had been vague. 
President of #Ukraine Volodymyr @ZelenskyyUa has implemented the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine dated August 20 to impose sanctions on a number of websites from #Russia and the occupied #Donbas.  This is stated on the @APUkraine website.
