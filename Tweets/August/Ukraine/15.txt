It's kind of remarkable because, today, the Ukrainian diaspora often seems far removed from #Ukraine. Other diasporas are similar.   There's a lot of history to be told about these diasporas. But today most people seem to either write them off or attribute too much power to them.
I have my ups and downs in #Ukraine, but I feel grateful to live in a place with such an interesting (albeit often tragic) history. And sometimes learning about history takes you places you didn't expect to go.

If there’s any lesson to be learned by #Ukraine from #Afghan crisis, it’s the need to do the hard, painful reforms to let democratic world leaders do a better job of forging favorable public opinion to keep the support! The problem is not the allies, but that they are democracies

@michaeldweiss @Euan_MacDonald So the #US threw $1 trillion &amp; many US &amp; other western lives at this project, &amp; I can’t recall the word “corrupt” ever being used while it did so. But for some reason that word gets rolled out regularly when a pathetic $3-400 million in military aid is allocated to #Ukraine.

@parkrunUK @ProD_Running I would tell them that #parkrun are legitimising the #Russian invasion and occupation of #Ukraine by showing #Crimea as Russian territory on their event map.
@NikaMelkozerova @Euan_MacDonald This shows, given the existential threat posed by #Russia, #Ukrainians aren’t serious enough in countering the attack of #Russian soft power against #Ukraine. You think #Churchill would have allowed #Nazi singers in WW2? The Battle of Briton was won by defiance not acquiescence.

#JoeBITEme assures you that his nukes and F-16s are ready for YOU. He has foreign fighters and Turkministan Pipeline to protect . Also #HunterBiden needs to make a run to #Ukraine and #China . What a perverse mess these dems are. @AdamSchiff , @ericswalwell , @JacksonLeeTX18

@motytchak @JEyal_RUSI Pathetic the #US does not put #Ukraine on this list, the country that sent its troops to back US &amp; western interests in #Iran, #Afghanistan, &amp; #Africa, &amp; has best experience fighting #Russian Army in recent times. Furthermore, several in the list are far more corrupt than UA.

SOME of that "something happened" is that #Ukraine came to MY TINY #PickensCounty couple years back. We were Stop #2. #WashingtonDC was Stop #1. Appeared to be about #hotels &amp; #travel. Accused/alleged female #childTrafficking perps relocated days later after YEARS here.  #GA14
WHO DID WHAT?! "#Russian #adoption agency"?! Since when?! Not #verified so I have to track it down. QUICK search already shows SOMETHING happened. *sighhh*  Why I'm interested: Because of ongoing garbage relative to &gt;&gt; #childTrafficking #Ukraine #GA14 #HOTELS #TRAVEL
