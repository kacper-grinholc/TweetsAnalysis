I'm not surprised that #Russia fakes its data  What I am astonished by is that the Kremlin is still reporting almost exactly 800 deaths every single day. All this while still maintaining #Covid19 cases are slowly falling. 795 Covid deaths today, 17,813 new infections.

@ElmarMammadov7 First look at the history! #Karabakh and much more was always a part of #Armenia. #Azerbaijan belongs to #Iran. Azerbaijan is an invented state by #Russia and #Turkey. #Armenians have always lived there, before the word #Azer even existed. Armenia was much bigger before. HISTORY

I don't understand why #china, #turkey and #russia willing to work with terrorists but not the resistance movement who are working to bring democracy and peace, maybe because they see terrorists as fools who will easily accept anything for our precious stones and wealth.
#Russia and #China’s  abstention from the UNSC resolution is just one example of their isolation imho . Arming jihadis didn’t work out for the Russians. Soon the situation will be so out of control that even they will not be able to do anything.They will have to pay for it dearly
