BREAKING! Russia Announces New Space Station!   #roscosmos #ross #russia #spacestation  #iss #spacex #nasa #elon
#Afghanishtan, 2021. — #Russia is now training the #Taliban to deploy the large fleet of Black Hawks donated by the #USA.
The #CIA hoped to return to its traditional #spycraft role against powers like #China and #Russia after the #Afghan war ends, but after the #KabulَAirportexplosion, #Biden will have it maintain a #paramilitary role to hunt down and kill #ISIS_K leaders. 
3 #Russia/#China have obviously left a presence in #Kabul. I'm surprised, seeing recent developments in dialogue with #Taliban by #collectiveWest, you haven't requested a limited presence to help with all those 1000s of #UK dependants left behind. How can you negotiate from afar?
#RUSSIA We peoples of Ethiopia thank Russsia and Russians support you shown in time Ethiopia in need.

Commeding #ken , #ind , #Russia &amp; #China for standing with the truth, it's sad to see few others trying hard 2 unfairly equate the immoral #TPLFisaTerroristGroup that, even after the unilateral ceasefire, recruited #ChildSoldiers, committed #AfarMassacre &amp; displaced&gt; 300,000 ppl.
In 1896 the Russian Czar donated his own money to help organize the first Russian medical contingent to treat Ethiopian soldiers. They bled and fought alongside us at Adwa. @nestaneth #Ethiopia #Russia
The truth is not what you believe in. #China, #Russia believe in rule of law, governed by it &amp; respect the sovereignty of countries. For the #Westerns democracy, freedom, human rights all are playing cards used to impose their unfair interest.

to #Russia. As evident the failures of #Trump and #Biden as war-leading chiefs, both Vietnam draftdodgers aside, we have more work to do in #Afghanistan. Given most recent #US forces KIA, we call on @WhiteHouse to secure permanent military base in the nation akin to Germany,

#Russia's state TV is reporting that the Taliban forbids the vaccination against COVID-19. 
Are There Countries with Multiple Capital Cities?  A number of countries such as Japan and Russia also claim to have multiple capitals. The Japanese, for example, consider Kyoto as important as Tokyo.  Have a look at the link. #Capital #Japan #Russia

After #Kabul airport explosion, #Russia has decided to fast track supply of arms to the Central #Asian countries bordering #Afghanistan to deter any spillover impact from the terror groups including #ISIS. 
For some, the Russian #T14 #Armata #MBT is groundbreaking, revolutionary and a military technology sensation. For the others, it's more of a breakdown tank that's too costly for #Russia. Is the T-14 just a spectre or a superior opponent for #NATO tanks? 
The #UnitedStates to provide assistance to #Azerbaijan for demining through @MarshallLegacy most likely in former #NagornoKarabakh-controlled areas and parts of the 1994 ceasefire line-of-contact joining #Turkey and #UK. #Russia does this in Armenian-inhabited NK. 
UPDATE: There were #Russia attacks today not just in #Avdiivka but also in other #Donbass areas: Vodyane, Mar'inka etc.: #Ukraine media citing military press services.
Thanks to members to #china, #russia, #india , #kenya and others by sides of ethiopians. Truth cant be hiden!

First, create problems and then become the messiah. That's what the USA and the warmongering countries have been doing. #War #Peace #WarMongers the #USA #India #Britain #Israel #Russia
"No peeing towards #Russia" or you may receive fines. I wonder if there is a prohibition sign on the Russian side as well...
