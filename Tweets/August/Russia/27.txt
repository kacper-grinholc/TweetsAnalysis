In view of the #US state's growing irresponsible behavior of impunity, as is evidenced in #Afghanistan, the role of #china and #Russia in challenging the US-led imperial and capitalist block, at the world stage, is vital! 
#Russia, #China, #India and #Kenya (with other co-Africans) have made  unforgattable history,siding with the truth and in unmasking the politicaltricks of westerners towards #Ethiopia under the pretext of #HRviol and #hinderance of #humanitarian assistance.
