@reasonoverfear @Beverle51995260 While that is a convenient idea which will benefit #Russia, it's not true. Russia has never cared about #HumanRights or even really Russians. That's just a misunderstanding of their foundations. The west occasionally actually does care, hence they have the moral high ground still
How the #world leaders feel about #Taliban entering #Kabul and the president fleeing to safety?  Big lesson -- no foreigners forces have ever stabilized a country. Decades of #Russia + decades of #USA = #ZERO 
@Cold_Peace_ #Russia and #China wished to see exit of US, backed by Iran. US delayed it's departure by 14 years deluded by #fake analysts crowding think tanks. Thinking of @MichaelKugelman? Now to point fingers to disguise your low IQ analysis is kinda unfair  #Taliban #Afghanistan #Kabul
It’s a complete failure when the #Taliban can conquer #Afghanistan without any problem. We need to send back troops but this time included Russia’s military. #Russia @usairforce @USMC @USArmy @USNavy @NATO @WhiteHouse @KremlinRussia_E
@karebear0517 No #AmericaFirst, right!  All roads in my opinion lead to #Russia on Afghanistan including #TFG actions and the ending of the war.

Whites of all stripes have hijacked the discourse, as always. Among them are the so-called anti-imperialists, who love to defend genocide and whitewash Soviet atrocities against the Afghans. They're gloating over American defeat. #Afghanistan #Taliban #Kabul #Russia #AfghanWomen 
IMHO #China will get close to #russia.  It will help the #Taliban in #Afghanistan  It will then move on to build a network with #Iran #Iraq #syria #lebanon. It will then get close to #libya thus encircling #israel #turkey #egypt. Dangerous world tonight.

My opinion on #Afghanistan:  If the #Taliban govt starts to undermine security in #Tajikistan &amp; #Russia, #China, and Iran, then it's a definite American victory. If Taliban creates friendly relations with those countries, then it's a definite #American defeat.   We have to wait.
#Russia 🇷🇺's Federation Council emphasized the need to avoid interference in #Afghanistan 🇦🇫's internal affairs.  Russian media outlets are interpreting this as an implicit criticism of the US and #Britain 🇬🇧's troop deployments in Afghanistan

the big winner in #Afghanishtan  is #china and #russia.    china has the money and needs friends - afghanistan also has massive mineral reserves.    +  Russia.  Russia stood by Assad.  bombed everyone like it was 90s Chechnya and won.  if you need an ally why choose #USA?

funny how #Democrats cried foul over a bullshit #Russia lie but now want to silence anyone questioning the 2020 election! 
@cnnbrk #Biden handed over the #Afghanistan to #Taliban to start another war against #Russia, #Iran and #China. moreover,this can  cause #Pakistan to join to Taliban.
@HinduAfghan #KabulHasFallen was just a round in the great game. The #game will continue. The only thing different will be movers and moves - Game is the same. #US &amp; #India WERE in #palace and #China #Russia #Pak in the fields. As of today, just reverse the roles!

@anders_aslund I agree with much of what you say, particularly Point 1, which I said to a friend yesterday. But the last point re regime change in #Russia commits the same mistake the #US made in #Afghanistan. You can’t ram longing for democracy down the throat of people who don’t want it.

#Russia says no plan to evacuate Kabul embassy #Afghanistan #Taliban 
I believe in that #china #Pakistan #russia can help #Afghan people's for against women's rights happening in #Afghanistan they can maintain peace with #Taliban for peace in that country,Some countries failed for save them but some countries are capable for better peace in #Afghan
@Lodge20201 @rep_stevewomack @HouseGOP This would have happened 4 months ago under #Trump, who was already negotiating with the #Taliban on taking over #Afghanistan . Trump helped free 5,000 Taliban prisoners back to the battlefield last year to assist in this final fight. Trump removed sanctions so #Russia could help
US HUBRIS and war profiteers are the reason why the United States economy is in the tank and american blood was WASTED in #AfghanistanBurning. We did the same to #Russia in the 80's
The United States, when it comes to the global community, can't leave it alone, and won't do enough to really accomplish the mission. Timid and tepid is not foreign policy, it's #politics #Afghanistan #Iraq #China #Russia #border #immigration

#Russia has alliance responsibilities under the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, and a rising level of violence in #Afghanistan makes it concerned about its spill over into #CentralAsia and within its own borders – @niveditakapoor. 
Russia doesn’t plan to evacuate its embassy in #Kabul stating it “received guarantees by #Taliban a while ago.” #Russia continues to designate the Taliban as a terrorist organization

For #Russia, main issue is not who is in power in #Kabul, they don't mind if forces violating human rights come to power. It cares more about radicals not crossing into Central Asia &amp; probably future assets. Meanwhile, they are already conducting exercises with Uzbeks and Tajiks.
#Kabul  Within America, if there is a little shame and pride left The throne of superpower must be left for #China and #Russia  The world's largest army but still defeated by 70,000 #Taliban in Afghanistan  What kind of superpower is this?  RT if you are agree  #Kabul 
Dangerously happy to see #America getting screwed up again after trying to counter countries through invading middle east First #russia and now #China
Now RAF C-17 from Cyprus is heading to Kabul,.......... #Russia #Afghanistan 
7. SPECIFIC SPONSOR COUNTRIES   According to BBC reporting, a classified CIA report estimated in 2008 that the #Taliban had received $106 million from foreign sources including governments of #SaudiArabia, #Russia, #Iran, and #Pakistan. They bankroll the terrorists.   END 
The actions of #Russia and #China do not surprise me at all.  Neither country can be trusted and they are not our friends!  #PresidentBiden and his Team are acutely aware of the situation and will move to take appropriate action. 
The #taliban has already taken control.  #Britain and #Russia both not want to recognize them as #afghan government yet. What then? 
Tragic #afghanistan blunders by #Biden. In the graveyard of empires, #USA in the 21st century follow in the footsteps of #Russia in the 20th century &amp; #Britain in the 19th century. #prayforafganistan, for their future future. RT
S. #Syria: negotiating Committee reached agreement with #Russia on #Daraa: - handover of weapons - amnesty - search campaign by #SAA + joint patrols with Russia - those refusing deported to the North. Insurgents, not part of deal, widely reject it.

How Old is Russia?  The history of Russia begins from the year 862 AD. People have lived in the region known as Russia for many millennia; however, the traditional history of the country dates back to the year 862.  Read on to know more. #Russia #History 
LMAO   #Russia invasion of #Baltic states has been part of western propaganda for years   The 'small' problem for those propagandists is that Russia doesn't have any intention to do so🤗 
GETAnalysis: #Assad feels entitled to rule #Syria, &amp; with #Putin's active help he is ruling, under the same #ShamDemocracy model as #Russia; but #Syrians need #RealDemocracy &amp; assistance to rebuild after total #destruction    #FourthTerm #NeitherFreeNorFair
#Afghanistan   No one country take Action  for Talibaan. Humanity is died  Where is #UNSC #UnitedStates #NATO #Russia . The fact is UNSC is also sleeping 2 months   Because no one any relation
This is me #USA, that was #Russia before it was #Britain &amp; all were entertained by only #Afghanistan 🙃 Yeh mein hoon, woh #Taliban hain aur aab pher se party ho rahe hai 🤭 No power on earth can control 🇦🇫 so how can Afghan blame #Pakistan or it means 🇵🇰 was always behind the✌️ 
Alrosa’s profit jumps on higher diamond prices! Demand for diamond jewelry continued to recover in Q2 21! #diamonds #Russia 
I certainly hope that #Russia is correct. BTW, #Moscow has also interfered in practically all of the #EuropeanUnion elections. #ElectionSecurity 
It's now down to the Taliban and the countries who intend to recognise a possible Taliban government #Turkey #China #Russia  to protect the Afghan people.  Maybe #StabbyKhan should contact them direct. 
@Charles_Lister I bet #EU, #Russia &amp; #China will be the first to recognize the Talibanstan! 
@RepStefanik Denegrating #america &amp; cheering on the enemy…you’re right behind #china &amp; #russia, both of which own the @gop. You won’t give a kid a school lunch but you’ll hand billions to the war mongers. Next week you’ll be bitching about the cost of replacing lead pipes in urban areas.
Points I Ponder While I Wander in the Leftist's Delusional BullShit Yonder   #China #russia salivating @ chance 2 further expand their sphere of dominance by entering into negotiations with #Taliban gov as #Afghanistan &amp; #Kabul fall  #Afghan_lives_matter  #AfghanistanBurning 
Where is #Russia on this, out of curiosity ?

US serial racist country.  #BBC follow them.  It used to be #Japan, #Taiwan, #Iraq, #Cuba, #Russia, #Mexico, #Iran, #BLM,,.  Every speech @JoeBiden makes tinged with anti-China racism.  US politician cannot make speeches without racist content.  Next up Taliban hate speeches 😀 
Oohh the #Russia’s  
#Russia is not closing its embassy in #Kabul. Instead, their envoy and ambassador are staying back as per new directives from #Moscow which says it all. 😉
Very soon #Taliban will takeover #Afganistan &amp; defeat #AlliedForces #US #NATO &amp; #5Eyes, which will undermine confidence in #Asia decisively on #US #Nato #5Eyes ability against #CHINA #Russia. #US unipolar #World ends! Now. @WIONews @CNN @BBCNews @FRANCE24 
#BREAKING : #Russia plans to hold contacts with the head of the political office of the Terrorist Taliban movement Mullah Baradar in #Doha - the #Russian Foreign Ministry.  #Afghanistan #AfghanistanBurning
#Taliban-Government is now reality in #Afghanistan.   Neighbour-States like #Pakistan, #China, #Russia, #Iran and #Türkiye  should stay with their #Embassys there and try to built a new #dialog between these states.
3/ Reportedly #JoeBiden had a brief meeting with #Putin before this move &amp; was asked #Russia to prepeare for any adverse outcome of this strategy. Putin has already ordered his military to start war drill near #Afghanistan border.
1/ It's a punishment for #Pakistan &amp; #China in disguise of a civil war.#Taliban will be used like a Pawn once again to capture major parts of #Pakistan &amp; sabotage #China belt &amp; road initiative. The biggest partner for this initiative would be none other than #Russia #KGB .
The stupid, uneducated idiots of western politics have created a new ally for #China🇨🇳 &amp; #Russia🇷🇺. 
#Turkey’s #SümelaMonastery hosts mass muted by #pandemic  #Patriarch #Bartholomew I joined 42 prominent figures of the church, from #Turkey, #Russia, #Greece and #Georgia. 
How long will we wait before we see #Russia (Ironically) and #China recognise the regime of #Taliban savages in #Afghanistan?
Sooner or later the big players in Asia; #Russia &amp; #China will recognize the legitimacy of the Taliban government in #Afghanistan.  I kind of have no doubts that #Turkey &amp; #Azerbaijan will too.  What do you think? Should #Armenia develop diplomatic ties with the Talib government? 
Suhail Shaheen,spox for #Taliban’s political office: "We have good rels w/ #Russia &amp; our policy in general is to ensure safe conditions for 🇷🇺 &amp; other embassies."  #Putin's #Afghanistan envoy &amp; RUS Amb in Kabul also suggest #Moscow calm about the situation
If "endless American presence in the middle of another country’s civil conflict was not acceptable" to you then why don't you withdraw US forces from #Ukraine?!  Oh ... that's different? US uses its 🇺🇦proxy to fight #Russia   #Donbass  
@HashimWahdatyar @Mintola69 Get support from #Russia and #iran do not rely on USA
@jacksonmahne Neither did #45 &amp; it didn't stop the @DNC from their pursuit! We have #Russia &amp; #China on #HunterBiden, a #BorderCrisis (he's responsible for Covid infection in border communities &amp; ANY fatalities) #Afghanistan where our #Troops &amp; citizens are under fire. So yes #IMPEACHBIDENNOW
