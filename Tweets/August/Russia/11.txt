Navalny Risks More Jail Time After New Charge   "If found guilty, #Navalny could face an extra three years in prison and could only be released after 2024, the year #Russia is scheduled to hold a presidential election"
@HayastanLady @ISafaryan Listen, you can self-determinate in LA, US or build another Arzakh in Marsel, #France naming it Martsakh or maybe in #Georgia naming it Javakh or maybe #Russia calling it Krasnodarkert, where else did I miss. Maybe the whole planet? 🤷🏻‍♀️ #KarabakhisAzerbaijan

@jakluge #Putin is acting like other hostage-takers. First the demands are made. The demands are then increased. Finally, the West is either prepared to meet #Russia's (political) ransom demands (e.g. in #Ukraine) - or, regrettably, #Navalny will die of so-called "health problems".
#Russia hits #AlexeiNavalny with new charge that could add to jail term 
Russia? Why am I not surprised?  #Facebook shuts accounts in #antiVaccine influencer campaign  #Russia-based marketing firm sought to pay social media influencers to smear #CovidVaccines
