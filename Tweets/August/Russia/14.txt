#Covid19 #pandemic continues in #Russia. A new anti record was set today in fatalities. 819 new deaths confirmed today due to #coronavirus. More than 22000 new cases of covid19 were confirmed today. Russia still struggles with #vaccination campaign as #DeltaVariant caused a surge

This figure, only takes into account deaths where #coronavirus was the primary cause of death after an autopsy. Under a broader definition, #Russia has seen more than 300,000 fatalities linked to #COVID19 as of the end of June. #Rosstat
A #Russian government tally on Friday showed 815 fatalities over the past 24 hours, bringing #Russia’s total fatalities from #COVID19 to 168,864 – the highest #Europe. #Moscow 
The same system that caused deadly #floods in northern Turkey is causing devastation in southern #Russia at the moment.

#Russia’s position at #UNGA76: Territorial status of #Crimea was determined by the Crimean population itself during the 2014 referendum. Any discussions on the situation in this Russian region that do not involve its residents bear no relation to reality.
