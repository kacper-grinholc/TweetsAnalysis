@CNNPR @tedcruz @CNN @clarissaward Cool, @CNNPR.  Now, do #Russia
#Russia's state TV ran clips featuring a Taliban spokesman and Tucker Carlson, both making the same point that the U.S. presence in Afghanistan was just a waste of time and money.

10. #Russia's interest is security &amp; current tactics makes sense.Yet #Moscow also beefing up its border &amp; strengthening CentAs/CSTO allies,deploying units &amp; holding drills - just in case. Rise in interest to Islamist ideology in Central Asia expected &amp; is long term challenge /End

@Sarah4Biden2020 @kino5336 @serena_patriot If Serena is lucky she may be able to see the window that Sarah Palin looks out of to #Russia.
8. So far #Taliban kept their promises - they guard the outer perimeter of the #Russia/n embassy in #Kabul &amp; the Russian ambassador in #Afghanistan will meet their representative tomorrow to discuss other issues. Some native Afghans w/ Russian passports requested evacuation.
Smart move. Lots of new business to be had in #Afghanistan  #America helped to ruin the country. #China will help to rebuild it &amp; benefit from it. #BidenFailure is others gain. #Putin will be next making friends with #Taliban to get #Russia its share of business opportunities. 
4/ and yes, #China (same as Turkey, a failure of the West is a victory for China) and #Russia (same as Turkey and China, plus the sweet sense of revenge for their lost war in Afghanistan against the Taliban).
7. #Russia drew its own redlines with #Taliban which revolved around 4 major issues: 
"If" Taliban wants peace then they should respect our flag, they should respect our laws not change them They should drop the guns and surrender not the other way around!! .#UnitedNation #America #Germany #Russia #Turkey #Iran #Tajikistan #Uzbekistan #France  #India

6. Those talks b/n  #Taoiban &amp; #Putin's envoy Zamir Kabulov (what a family name for an Afghanistan envoy!) in early July were key to #Russia's position in the current developments &amp; likely to form foundation for its policy vis-a-vis #Taliban for years to come
It is ONLY #Russia and #China that have a bit of influence over Talibans. The two countries overtly were against Afghanistan invasion and their embassies in Kabul are operating at 100% capacity.
@ScottMStedman You know, because of those Russian bounties on American troops paid to the #Taliban                          #Russia #Afghanistan
@RepGregMurphy perhaps if you stopped whinging and whimpering and actually looked at whose actions have made it possible for #Russia to walk into Afghanistan (Fmr president Trumpsky) and started looking into who in the @GOP aided the attack on 1/6 you might be of some use.
@FCChief95 @cnnbrk Russia, OPEC already laughing at US. They know who's replacing Uncle Joe. #OPEC #oilandgas #energy #Afganistan #Russia #SaudiArabia #BreakingNews 
5. When #Taliban began large scale offensive, #Moscow said it didn't believe they had capacity to capture all of the country. Some argue both 🇷🇺 &amp; 🇺🇸assessments failed. Others,however,believe #Russia realized Afghan gov 'd fall quicker than expected &amp; Taliban came for new talks
@SecBlinken Comparing notes on how superpowers can get beaten by Afghan tribal leaders?  USSR in 1989 after just 10 years and US in 2021 after 20 years.  At least the US shows perseverance…. 🙄#afghan #taliban #russia #blinken
China’s advanced PLA aircraft ready for Russian debut in sign of growing mutual trust  #China #Russia #PLA #advancedaircrafts
4. When other great powers - #China and #US began overtures to #Taliban - #Russia too jumped the train and on a few occasions invited #Doha based 'political wing' of the Taliban for talks in #Moscow. This gave birth to hypocritical criticism over "how come 🇷🇺 deals w/ terrorists"

@POTUS Sir Why can’t we sanction counties like  #Pakistan #China #russia who support Taliban and probably supply weapons to them. Humanity above politics. God help people if #Afganistan in this trouble time
