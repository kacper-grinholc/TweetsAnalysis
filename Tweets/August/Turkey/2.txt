Journalists who criticize the government are no longer allowed to practice their profession in #Turkey, which is bad enough. The fact that they are being forced to live in dread in #Germany, where they have sought sanctuary, is in no way acceptable.
that the line has been crossed and that the violent threats directed at journalists fleeing #Turkey's oppressive regime are unacceptable. The two people on the list have been arrested by German authorities.
