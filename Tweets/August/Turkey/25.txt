„TB2 should be intercepted with systems exceeding the range of TB2's missiles.“  Uhm yeah… the Pantsir S-1s in Libya and Syria has failed miserably which should be well suited against UAVs.  #Russia #Turkey #Libya #TB2

#Turkey is openly supporting @AbiyAhmedAli’s genocidal war on #Tigray &amp; #Oromia.   Ironically, close to $3Billion worth Turkish investments are also found in Oromia.   #OLA must take action on Turkish investments in Oromia.
