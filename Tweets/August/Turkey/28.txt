It's puzzling to many as to what the president of #Turkey    @Plaid_Erdogan thinking when deciding to stay controversial and religious extremist? He should not forget Turkey has blood in its hands from massacring armenians. Is #Erdogan interested in massacring Tegaru too?

#Turkey, being a member of @NATO is supporting #TigrayGenocide, by providing drones to @AbiyAhmedAli. The US, as a responsible member of @NATO &amp; leading power, should look into this, in order to #StopWarOnTigray &amp; ease the humanitarian crisis. #TigrayCantWait #TigrayFamine

“If we take Iran's attitude against #Turkey about the situation in the region into consideration, this warning should be payed attention to.    #Iran secretly acquiring the technology doesn't seem unlikely to me.”

@AlanTonelson If this heralds a transition to a peaceful balance of power in the #MiddleEast btw Iran &amp; Saudi Arabia/Israel with the EU as the balancing outside power, it’s actually good news. #Turkey would be a key player in such a system. However, far too early to be sure of success.
@SecBlinken @MevlutCavusoglu You continue to preach that #Turkey is an important @NATO ally but say nothing about their role on #TigrayGenocide. #Turkey is undoing the US &amp; EU's humanitarian efforts by selling drones to🇪🇹. All #TurkeyDroneSale should be condemned &amp; halted, if not millions more will die.

The #US. Trade Representative's office in June announced 25% tariffs on over $2 billion worth of imports from six countries over their digital services taxes - including #Turkey - but immediately suspended the duties to allow time for international tax negotiations to continue.
It said #Turkey had asked the United States not to impose additional tariffs, by pointing out the consultation processes carried out within the OECD in the steel industry.
Tai discussed digital services taxes, improving access for #US. companies in #Turkey and other issues with her Turkish counterpart, Mehmet Mus, during a virtual meeting on Wednesday, her office said in a statement released on Thursday.
