Like the devastating earthquake in #Iran, #Turkey’s evil leaders put their #hate for #Israel ahead of the welfare of their people who’re currently in harm’s way from these out-of-control #wildfires. It’s an age old story that never ceases to repulse. 
People in #Turkey have gone completely mad! Around 100 people attacked a car in Aydin province thinking the persons inside came there to set the forest on fire. Similar incidents have been happening in the past week, mainly Kurds or those who look like Kurds being targeted.

➡ #Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau has offered support for #Turkey in dealing with #wildfires that have killed at least eight people and destroyed large swathes of forest in that country during the last several days. 
He urged everyone to only heed official statements and announcements rather than disinformation.  Commenting on the hashtag, President Recep Tayyip #Erdoğan in a televised interview Wednesday said that the tag was created to counter #Turkey's strength.
Earlier this week #Turkey’s Communications Director #FahrettinAltun stated that the #Twitter campaign was being orchestrated from abroad from a single center, with the aim of weakening ties between the people and state.
As Turkey battles forest fires, many social media users took to #Twitter to express their sorrow and request help for #Turkey. But the call for help was not well received due to the implication that Turkey is unable to fight the blazes itself.
