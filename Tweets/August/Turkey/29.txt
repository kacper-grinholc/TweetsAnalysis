📢 The number of defence industry projects in #Turkey increased by approximately 12 times between 2002 and 2020. 
@SecBlinken @MevlutCavusoglu Indeed #Turkey has proved time and again as a reliable partner worldwide.  I hope #Ethiopia did not pop up in that discussion, Mr. Secretary!
We know why our enemies are angry with #Ethiopia &amp; #Turkey|'s friendship. It’s hard to find a friendship based on mutual respect and trust as well as cooperation. #TPLFTerroristGroup  #SaluteErdoğan  @MFATurkey @RTErdog @trpresidency @EU_Commission @EU_ECHOhealth @MFATurkey

On this day, 26 years ago, journalist Sayfettin Tepe was murdered in Batman, #Turkey. We need a safer world for the truth. #EndImpunity

⭕️#Turkey: #Erdogan writes on #AKINCI #UAV a message to his people! Satire komşular 😉 
You have no respect for national borders but guilty is Turkish people right? That shows the real truth. Who's right who's wrong! History never changes. #azerbaijan #turkey

Dear @RTErdogan we, Ethiopians, will not forget your brotherly support to our beloved country #Ethiopia. May you and your mighty nation #Turkey be blessed and live long. 
#Turkey:   The Turkish President Erdogan has left a coded message inside the @Baykar_Savunma made Akıncı UCAV which will stay perpetuated for millions of flight times to come. 
The #UK #US #EU risk overt alienation from a strategic country like #Afhganistan given a clear geopolitical lead to #China #Russia #Pakistan #Turkey to provide a soft landing. Economic sanctions may also not work as intended - engagement with the government is much sustainable. 
As a Nation and State, both #Turkey 🇹🇷 &amp; #ETH have been in a historic struggle in recent years, to protect their existence &amp; future.   Because the two giants are on the eve of becoming stronger &amp; prosperous.    #TPLFTerroristGroup   #SaluteErdoğan   @MFATurkey

When a country signs a military agreement with the West, they call it friendship &amp; business.   If the agreement is with #Turkey 🇹🇷, it suddenly becomes a file for genocide.  Shame‼️  #TPLFTerroristGroup #SaluteErdoğan  @MFATurkey @RTErdogan @trpresidency @EU_Commission @eu_echo
The #HOA, #Ethiopia 🇪🇹 and #Turkey 🇹🇷 have historical &amp; cultural ties.   Strengthening economic and military ties between the two countries helps stabilize the turbulent Horn of #Africa's that #TPLFTerroristGroup trying to destabilize.  #SaluteErdoğan   @MFATurkey  @RTErdogan
@GissaAbba @MFATurkey @RTErdogan @trpresidency @EU_Commission @eu_echo @UNGeneva @EUCouncil "Turkey's drone will bring peace wherever it goes," said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan made the remarks at the launch of a new unmanned aerial (drone) today.#Turkey  @Erdogan #Ethiopia. #TPLFTerroristGroup  #SaluteErdoğan @MFATurkey 
1. The #Turkey gov funded the reconstruction of #AlNejashiMosque which was shelled by #Ethiopian &amp; #Eritrean forces yet instead of being harsh to these forces,@RTErdogan went ahead &amp; signed a military agreement with Abiy.#TurkeyDroneSale #ErdoğanGenocideAccomplice @TurkishEmbassy
@TsenatSaba Indeed, #Tigray and #Turkey have been enjoying positive relations. #Turkey's suppprt in renovating Al Nejashi Mosque was symbolic. What we oppose is arming the genocidal gov i  Addis to annihilate the ppl of #Tigray. #StopArmingEthiopia  #StopTigrayFamine
#Turkey and #BurkinaFaso end in a 1-1 tie at Northeast Supersite!  #PHLUnityCup @phlsoccer2026
@yesisworld Mike Flynn did nothing wrong, except take money from #Turkey to influence US policy without registering as a foreign agent, lying to investigators about it, then lying that he did not lie. 
#Ethiopia 🇪🇹 &amp; #Turkey 🇹🇷 have strong bilateral diplomatic r/n since 1896.  More recently, the two countries celebrated 125th anniversary of official diplomatic relation.  We 🇪🇹 ns thank the people &amp; Gov't of #Turkey 🇹🇷 for their unwavering support &amp; friendship‼️  #SaluteErdogan

The consequential visit of  @AbiyAhmedAli to #Turkey heralds a new diplomatic paradigm to correct the long-held hegemony of western powers,especially in Africa. #TPLFTerroristGroup  #SaluteErdoğan  @MFATurkey @RTErdogan @trpresidency @EU_Commission @eu_echo @MFATurkey  @UNGeneva
