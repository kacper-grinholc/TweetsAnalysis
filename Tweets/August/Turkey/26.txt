@eha_medya Why is #Turkey backing the government accused of genocide with his ally from Asmara?  Does #Turkey choose to prolong the imposed suffering on the people of #Tigray including weaponizing of hunger &amp; gang rape, massacres, mass killing, mass arrest, destruction &amp; historic artifacts?

The savagery and impunity with which #Tigraygenocide is conducted by #Ethiopian &amp; #Eritrean armies &amp; #AmharaMilitia has no bounds. A second round is underway with the help of #Turkey|'s drones.  @unsc @eu_eeas @_AfricanUnion @StateDept time for long overdue decisive action. 
#Ethiopia PM Abiy blocks humanitarian aid to millions forcing millions in to man made famine. #Turkey: ‘here are some drones to speed up your Genocide’ @trpresidency must reconsider and stop using Africans as a test site for his weapons. #TigrayFamine @StateDept @SecBlinken @nato
#Turkey will pay dearly in its interference to facilitate the #TigrayGenoicde . Do not be fooled by its seemingly contribution to #AlNejashi. Turkey is a certified Genocide promoter. @MFATurkey @SecBlinken @USAmbUN @EU_Commission @CNN @AJEnglish @BBCAfrica 
@AmbassadorTai Though long overdue this's a welcome step in the right direction. @PMAbiy|'s govt is launching a second round #TigrayGenocide with his pal #Issaiay of #Eritrea and #Turkey's drones. Deplomatic persuasions have for long fallen on deaf ears, time for decisive action.
