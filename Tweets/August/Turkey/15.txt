@ANCA_DC @NOAASatellites @elonmusk @SpaceX @SecBlinken @SecDef @DeputySecState @HelloLauraKelly And here is why #Taliban finds #Turkey to be its ally 👇  So does @elonmusk think it is a good idea to give #Erdogan a satellite access? What about our government?

The two countries have also signed a range of agreements during the #Sudanese delegation’s visit to #Turkey.
Some 100,000 hectares of agricultural land in #Sudan were allocated to #Turkey to cultivate, he added.  Oktay said both countries had agreed to allocate another 700,000 hectares to Turkey.
During the #Turkey-#Sudan businesspeople narrow-scoped consultation meeting in the capital #Ankara, Oktay said that bilateral trade volume reached $480 million in 2020.
#Turkey and #Sudan aim to reach a trading volume of $2 billion in the next five years, Vice President #FuatOktay stated Friday, underlining the potential of greater economic ties between the two countries.

#Afghans are believed to be the second-largest refugee community in #Turkey after #Syrians. Many of the migrants arriving via Iran are heading for #Istanbul to find work or passage to another coastal city from which to embark for #Europe.
#Ankara so far has spent around $40 billion on the #Syrians in #Turkey, while the support from the European Union to Turkey for refugees has been only around 3 billion euros from a promised 6 billion euros – a gap Turkey has long demanded be rectified.
#Turkey has made large investments in social cohesion policies to enable Syrians to integrate into #Turkish society smoothly.
A match was lit to set #Turkey ablaze. Clearly, this is an ‘internal threat’! A meticulous scenario is being acted out! 
#Turkey hosts nearly 4 million refugees – more than any country in the world. After the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, Turkey adopted an "open-door policy" for people fleeing the conflict, granting them "temporary protection" status.
#Turkey has made clear that it will not bear the burden of the migration crises experienced as a result of the decisions of third countries.
#Turkey has deployed additional reinforcements to its eastern border with Iran and new measures are expected to be applied. Border security will be supported by technological systems.
"The walls being built there are to prevent these irregular migrants from entering our country," he underlined.  #Turkey has been a key transit point for asylum-seekers attempting to cross into #Europe to start new lives, especially those fleeing war and persecution.
The Turkish president also denied that there was an influx of irregular migrants crossing #Turkey's borders, as is currently being "exaggerated on social media."
#Turkey is not a pit stop for migrants, President Recep Tayyip #Erdoğan said late Wednesday and added that the country is taking the necessary steps to avert an irregular migration crisis due to the situation in #Afghanistan.
The teams, which completed the first 5-kilometer section of the modular wall, were deployed to prevent irregular migrants from entering #Turkey through Iran along the border.
#Turkey is at war with secret agencies, social media networks, and mobs of funded journalists!
