The Chief of #Somali National Army, Brigadier General, Odawa Yusuf has met in #Turkey with his #Turkish counterpart General Yaser Guler. They discussed ways to strengthen the support #Turkey  provides to #SNA. 
@StymieSi @EddieFogden ....Not tweetable. It can only be told verbally. With hand motions depicting his 'size' Said chap and me got on very well - esp as I had a penchant for traditional turkish music. Much underrated ;-) #Turkey
Why are there are no internationally coordinated search efforts to find missing #Yezidis? They have been found in #Syria #Iraq &amp; #Turkey - but often just by chance. We discussed practical steps to help #EndTrafficking. The #YezidiGenocide is ongoing. @StateGWI @StateIRF @USAmbUN 
@avmuratakkoc @trpresidency @TurkishEmbassy @TurkEmbLondon @AnkaraUganda We don't care to know about your corrupt system #Turkey, we do not care to know who is in bed with who. We are only concerned about the freedom of our brother, political activist @LumbuyeFred. #freeFredLumbuye 
In #Turkey, #Afghans are the second-largest migrant group after #Syrians with 120,000 Afghan #refugees and up to 300,000 undocumented Afghan #migrants. The largest group are the approximately 3.6 million Syrians.

In 2016, #Turkey and the European Union signed the so-called EU-Turkey deal so Turkey would stem the flow of hundreds of thousands of migrants and #refugees towards $Europe, in return for visa-free travel for Turkish citizens and substantial EU financial support. #Afghanistan
Faced with a potential uptick in arrivals of #refugees from #Afghanistan,#Turkey is reinforcing its border with #Iran.Even though a new concrete wall appears to have limited irregular crossings,the number of Afghans said to be gathering near the border with no way back is causing
Happy Friday! I hope you’re able to experience so joy this weekend and #dabkeh dance at a wedding! Have a great weekend! Get me to #Turkey! #Halay #dabke 
Today I just realized something interesting. Haderies consider Erdogan of #Turkey as their true king more than the seventh king of #Ethiopia. Hey, I am not judging except for finding out where we are going to stand when the time comes. #Oromia
Regional rivals #Turkey &amp; UAE hold talks – rare happening. Faced with limping economy, Turkish President Erdogan says it could bring significant #UAE investment to Turkey. Also, amid growing trade issues with #Saudi – a Turkish rival, UAE appears to be sending a signal to them. 
MSM Let’s talk #Turkey abt the Kurds.  Uproar-so Some1 built Kurds a suburb in No Iraq. Who paid for the suburb where it seems thanking Americans, if asked by journalists, is part of the requirement to stay in faux utopia.   Who paid for village/How many killed is JOURNALISM!
Summary of ‘democracy’ in #Turkey 
The relations between the #UAE and #Turkey have been marked by rivalry and tension, particularly in regional politics. Is normalization on the horizon?  See my latest for the @trtworld From rivalry to rapprochement: What’s behind UAE and Turkey’s meeting?

#Arabs need to get statement from thier authorities, who was forced to cut ties without reason by #UAE with #Turkey including economic boycott, a specially for #Egypt #KSA. l hope Arab intellectuals will say something about it. #تركيا 
DISPATCHES | The mood towards the four million or so #refugees seems to be souring. While they have long been tolerated by the Turkish govt &amp; people, anti-migrant animosity has been growing.   #Turkey #migrants
#Erdogan urged #European countries to take responsibility for migrants coming from #Afghanistan, adding #Turkey had no intention of becoming “Europe’s migrant storage unit” amid turmoil in the country after the #Taliban’s takeover.  READ MORE:

My article on #climatechange and #climateaction in #Turkey. Thank you Aljazeera for your interest in regional climate issues! 
As @UNIraq is obliged to refrain from naming + shaming member states, the actor 'undertaking military operations' is #Turkey. Also questionable whether this was a 'military' operation, as opposed to political assassination and intentional destruction of #Yezidi #Yazidi hospital. 
#Erdogan said on Friday that #Turkey is hosting some 300,000 documented and undocumented #Afghan #refugees, adding #Ankara has been putting in the necessary effort for #Afghanistan's development and will continue to do so

Pashinyan said #Armenia is ready to normalize relations with #Turkey without preconditions. My take on this (if anyone asks) is sceptical. 1. Is Turkey ready to normalize relations without preconditions? They backed down the last time 🇦🇲 tried.  2. How will Turkey benefit?&gt;
