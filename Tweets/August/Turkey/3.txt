These were the dramatic scenes as locals in southern #Turkey scrambled to fight a #wildfire that had surrounded their village.  Villagers in #Cokertme raced to get a water hose long enough to reach the flames.  Others tried to usher their farm animals from danger.
@jezzeya @Reuters @Stanford should be ever so proud that they admitted someone so “bright” from #turkey - #stanforduniversity #admissions 💵
The Afghan refugee crisis brewing on Turkey’s eastern border     #refugees #AfPak #Turkey 
Burning #Greece. Many wildfires couple of last days, cannot even follow up anymore. Power cuts make it all even more horrible while connections are lost. In #Turkey there already are deaths and traumatized from huge fires, now #PrayingforGreece #Βαρυμπομπη
#Turkey sent 8 F-16 jet fighters over Aegean and #Greece intercepted them. It would have been another silly dogfight if both countries didn't lack firefighting aircrafts amidst #wildfires. Keep fighting stupid people.   #Turkeyisburning #βαρυμπομπη #turkiyeyaniyor 
Fires in southern #Turkey leave burn scars where forest once stood. A tragic time-lapse of satellite imagery since July 27 🔥 #TurkeyIsBurning

July 2021 in #Turkey had an average temperature of 26.3C, 1.8C above the 1981-2010 baseline and was the 2nd hottest ever. The month witnessed the highest temperature in the country history with 49.1C. The extreme heat in this beginning of August is focused in the West and South. 
Words are not enough to describe #Turkey's barbarism.  #Turquie #Turchia #Turquia 
My thoughts: If #EU wants to stem a new wave of Iraqi refugees, it should address #Iraq's state failure holistically.    @UNIraq @EUinIraq #Iran #Qatar #KSA #Kuwait #Turkey #UAE   #Kurdistan #العراق #السعودية #قطر #الامارات #كردستان  #الكويت #البحرين 
All said and done, but we never tolerate the death or destruction of innocent human beings, animals, or destruction of the nature. I hope the fire in #Turkey extinguishes soon. 🙏🏼

#Turkey is burning #Greece is burning and instead of coming together and start buying aircrafts and equipment to be ready for this calamity, we buy weapons... I pray for us all
A senior forestry official described the wildfires as the worst in #Turkey in living memory, though he could not say how many acres of forest land had been destroyed.
