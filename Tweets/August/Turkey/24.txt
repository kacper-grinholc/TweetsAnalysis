A few months ago, #Turkey was threatening #Incirlic, where the #US stores 50 nuke warheads; helps #Iran evade sanctions through #Halkbank - and now all the sudden they’re an “invaluable partner”. Presumably for appeasing the #Taliban - who consider the #Turks allies btw.

Good idea, but highly unlikely to succeed in influencing another immoral state because just like #Ethiopia, #Turkey values not humanity. I assure you the arrangement between @trpresidency &amp; @AbiyAhmedAli is transactional. More a reason for #TDF to step up their efforts!
