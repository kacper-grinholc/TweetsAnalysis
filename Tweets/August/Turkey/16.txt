I am really no expert on military issues and least on #Afganisthan … but besides the mistakes made by the US and their @NATO allies, shouldn’t we also be pointing the fingers at those that support the #Taliban ? Thinking of #Pakistan, #SaudiArabia, #Turkey and their minions…
Well then they should get to building them. #Turkey received billions upon billions of euros from the #EU for this purpose. Not to mention the fact that #Turkey is very friendly with terrorist groups like #ISIS, #Hamas and the #Taliban. Do not believe the victim narrative.
