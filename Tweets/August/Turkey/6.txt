#Greece and #Turkey fail to stop huge wildfires. In Greece it is difficult to contain the fire approaching Athens. Monks were forcibly evacuated in May near the capital. "The situation is extremely critical," the prime minister said, after the first person perished in the fires. 
It's just crazy anyone would believe this anyway, but sadly there are those in #Turkey that will. 
Thousands of people have fled wildfires that are burning out of control in #Greece and #Turkey, including a large blaze just north of #Athens that left one person dead.
