The issue is also likely to feature in talks between #Ankara and #Brussels about updating a 2016 deal under which #Turkey received aid for hosting migrants seeking refuge in the #EuropeanUnion.
#Turkish Defence Minister #HulusiAkar said last week that surveillance at the #Iranian border had been increased with additional troops, among other measures.  #Turkey is also erecting a wall along parts of the 300-kilometer (186-mile) border.
#Turkey, which hosts around 4 million refugees, is currently building new security measures on its eastern border. #Afghans are believed to be the second-largest refugee community in the country after #Syrians.
Turkey and Iran are the countries most affected by the migration problem caused by increasing tensions resulting from the advance of the #Taliban in #Afghanistan, #Turkey's Parliament Speaker Mustafa Şentop stated on Thursday.
"After the crossing of #Turkey, smugglers put us on a truck with 300 people. We were dying because of the lack of air in the truck. Thanks to the gendarmerie, they caught us and saved us. They charge us up to $1,000 to cross into Turkey," he added.
Explaining that he escaped from #Afghanistan and took refuge in Iran and worked there, Selim Sırdaş said: "#Iranian soldiers caught us, took our money, our stamps, everything. They deported us from there to Turkey. Iranian soldiers transferred us to #Turkey."
#Iranian soldiers persecuted us a lot. They sent us by force so that we could go to #Turkey. We are moving on the roads with the locations that were sent from #WhatsApp."
Stating that they went through difficult roads and starved for days until they came to #Turkey, Nabi said: "We could no longer live in our country. Violent clashes began between the #Taliban and the security forces.
Hayatullah Ahmedzai, 19, an #Afghan national and one of the irregular migrants who came to the #Tatvan district of #Turkey's eastern Bitlis province illegally, told Anadolu Agency (AA) that he has been on the road for 25 days.
Some of the irregular #migrants who have recently entered #Turkey illegally, mostly #Afghans, claim that the security forces that detained them in #Iran tortured them and took their money.
#Kuwait has sent fire trucks and a firefighter team of 45 people to #Turkey to support the fight against forest fires.
