“And we reiterate our gratitude to #Turkey for its substantial humanitarian efforts in hosting over 4 million refugees - more than any other country in the world- who have fled any number of countries. And that includes #Syria, #Iraq, #Afghanistan, #Iran and elsewhere,” he added.
We do regret the concerns that statements have raised regarding the potential travel of #Afghans to #Turkey,” Ned Price, the spokesman of the #US. State Department, told reporters at a briefing on Aug. 4.
“Well, I do want to stipulate that it is not the #US. Government’s policy to encourage or to direct individuals seeking protection to specific safe-havens, nor did we in this case. We did not direct anyone to a specific country, and that includes #Turkey.
#Turkey has also been suggested as a possible application spot, he added.  Later, the U.S. expressed #Washington’s regrets over #Ankara’s concerns that a recent U.S. decision on the #Afghan migrants can lead to a potential influx of Afghans to #Turkey.
Ankara will not accept the “irresponsible” decision taken by the #US. regarding the resettlement of #Afghan refugees because the plan addresses #Turkey as the target country for application of the #migration procedures, Foreign Ministry spokesperson #TanjuBilgiç said on Aug. 3.
His remarks came over the #US. new resettlement plan for #Afghans who have assisted the U.S. officials and troops during its mission in #Afghanistan since 2009. The plan names #Turkey among the application spots for eligible Afghans who want to #migrate to the U.S.
“#Turkey is not anyone’s refugee camp. No one should think of this region as a concentration camp,” Çelik added.  Turkey is not capable to shelter further refugee influx, he said but emphasized that nobody should use “#fascist language” while discussing the matter.
“State departments are having talks with all relevant parties. There is a division of roles between state institutions. #Turkey embraces people fleeing death. Other than that, we do not allow it to be abused,” he told reporters at a press conference.
Nobody should consider #Turkey as a refugee camp, the ruling Justice and Development Party’s (#AKP) spokesperson #ÖmerÇelik said on Aug. 9, elaborating on recent discussions after #Afghans started fleeing to Turkey.
