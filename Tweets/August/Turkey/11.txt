Fascist #Turkey. I don't see you complaining now that Turkey has organized a pogrom against their Syrian refugees @ErikMarquardt @Tineke_Strik @alarm_phone @teammareliberum I thought you were humanitarians 
A great part of the ‘Left’ in #Turkey is unashamedly #nationalistic. Its bias against #Syrian #refugees may stem in part because so many opposition politicians are #sectarian #Alevis - who are from #Assad’s same religious minority - pretending to be ‘secular.’ #Syria #Ankara
The strength of the water was so strong that it caused at least 2 5+ story high apartment buildings to collapse , with reports saying that people were seen in them before the collapses  #Turkey 
It seem like the Erdogan regime,Turks and the whole world do not quite comprehend the extent of the disaster in Bozkurt. The city was hit with a tsunami like wall of water,approximately 4m high, that swept everything in its path, including homes,people and cars. #Turkey 
There’s great anger at the Erdogan regime in general and the local authorities in particular due to the very sleepy approach to helping the people of destroyed Bozkurt.  What is being done is far from being a minimal effort. #Turkey
#Turkey’s #Erdogan Says He May Receive #Taliban Leader for Talks
Fascism is engraved in the factory settings of the Turkish state.   Another pogrom in #Turkey. This time Syrian refugees are being attacked.   The Turkish state is silently and actively supporting attacks by helping fascist mobs to get to their targets. 
Pictures of some of the missing people after the tsunami like flash flood in Bozkurt , hope that everyone will be found safe and sound  #Turkey 
#Kristallnacht beginning - stirred up for years now by pro #Assad #Turkish opposition politicians, with their #populist, #racist narratives. A horrible crime was committed: but this does not justify communal punishment of women &amp; children. #Ankara #Syria #refugees #Turkey #Assad 
More from the ongoing rescue efforts in Bozkurt , the number of missing people and the extent of the damage will be clear only after daybreak  #Turkey
