A lot of Turkish twitter have been tweeting for help and this guy just branded them foreign agents.  What a stupid, cruel man.  #Turkey will no doubt accept EU aid anyway, then downplay it.
  Turkey accepted aid from Russia, not Greece (foreign policy decision) Altun says EU aid is motivated by idealogy, make #Turkey look weak and that Turkish twitter calls for aid (like K-pop accounts above) are not genuine. He then he promotes #StrongTürkiye 
@trpresidency Why #Turkey would continue to provide every kind of support to #Ethiopia,  to continue #TigrayGenocide.  Stop ✋supporting the Ethiopian dictator @AbiyAhmedAli
