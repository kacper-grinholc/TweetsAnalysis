#Taliban discussing running Kabul airport with #Turkey, #Qatar: #France 
The United States is in contact with #Turkey and #Qatar to restore operations of the civilian part of Kabul airport in order to send humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan through it, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.
 A new photo project I am working on. Check it out!  #Turkey is a country of contrast. There are some cities that are #traditional and #religious while others are #progressive and laic. #Istanbul is a little bit of both worlds.  #… 
“#Qatar is working on persuading the #Taliban to stick to their moderate message…they are trying to make sure that this message gets through and is stuck to by the #Taliban in terms of their future actions...the Taliban have asked #Turkey &amp; Qatar with help with #Kabul Airport" 
Of all the major political players in #Sandžak, Zukorlić is most critical of #Turkey and is much closer to #SaudiArabia and #Gulf countries. A major Turkish investment in the region would be a way for #Ankara to re-assert itself in light of the changing local political landscape.

In this statement, #Çavuşoğlu stated that #Turkey aims to have President #Vucic visit #Turkey by the end of the year. However, why didn't #Erdogan come to #Serbia, then? #Erdogan knows the power of symbolism. Through diplomatic protocol, he is disciplining his Serbian colleague.
The opening of the consulate was agreed upon before #Erdogan's recent displeasure with #Serbia and policies of its President #aleksandarvučić. #Çavuşoğlu's visit and statements show that #Turkey still wants to maintain ties with #Serbia due to its centrality in the #Balkans.
