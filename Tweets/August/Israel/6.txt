#G7 foreign ministers on Friday said "all available evidence clearly points to #Iran" being behind a drone strike on July 29 against an #Israel-linked #tanker that killed a former British soldier and Romanian national. #AFP 
@JoeTruzman @cduhaime Did anybody in #Israel get caught and arrested for firing rockets at #Lebanon ? Media influence?
A warrior goes to war only when needed and with a grave face and with great compassion,as if entering a funeral.  He doesn't mean any personal harm.  He does his work and then step back.  #Afganistan #ashrafghani #Taliban #israel #Palestine #Gaza #peace
@SecBlinken @Lamamra_dz The August Editorial of #Algerian Military mouth piece El Djeich has yet to digest the #Israel - #Morocco normalization, writing they are surrounded by #US sponsored Zionists complotting to destroy the country. The same military dictatorial regime accepted the US corona #USAID!

The true person values peace and the quite.  They do not glorify victory.  To glorify it, is to glorify slaughter of people and those who glorify slaughter, never thrive.  #Afganistan #ashrafghani #Taliban #israel #Palestine #Gaza #peace
BUT if they see a #Kurdish Jew raising the flag of #Israel, they will go mad and accuse the #Kurds of treason, labor and Zionism....  Beyond the media screen and under the political table, the truth appears from time to time.
Halal normalization...!   The #Turks üáπüá∑ and the #Israelis üáÆüá± celebrate the arrival of 3 firefighting planes to help Turkey control forest fires. It is permissible for #Arabs and #Turks to deal with the State of #Israel  BUT... 
‚ÄúOne has to wonder how the Israelis who frequent the restaurants &amp; bars around the #Moskubiya would feel if they could see the sights &amp; hear the screams of those being held there @mikopeled  #Palestine #Israel #ICC #Torture #Occupation #Apartheid #WarCrimes
Weapons are tools of violence and all decent men avoid them.  Only when there is no other choice left, does he use them with utmost restraint.  #Afganistan #ashrafghani #Taliban #israel #Palestine #Gaza #peace
#BDS say: "#Israel is an apartheid state because they won't allow Palestinians into their clubs!"  Support #Israel's right to defend itself!

Revived clashes between the #IDF and #Hezbollah aren't anything new, but it's certainly worth keeping an eye on tensions along the Israeli-Lebanese border as an extension of the intensifying #Israel-#Iran 'cold war'.
However, I believe that amidst rising frustration in #Lebanon--particularly as the country marks the anniversary of the #BeirutBlast--revived clashes with #Israel can be used by #Hezbollah as a temporary means to offload political pressure. 
It's likely that Hezbollah may have anticipated a retaliatory attack from #Israel with clashes in southern #Lebanon, so to keep face, they initiated the first strike.

Today, #Hezbollah launched strikes on IDF forces, inciting retaliatory fire from #Israel into south #Lebanon. My two cents on the strikes' timing:  
Reports of  #IAF ( #Israeli Airforce ) loaded with missiles south Gaza. #Israel
   #Iran #Israel  What's going to come
How can anyone not see the ISIS in #Israel? Thats not a state that fits in modern society and today's values, Zionists are still living two millennial ago and theyre assuming a revenge thats 2000 years old. Such mentality only belongs in Guantanamo Bay! 
Emad Ali Dwaikat, 37, a father of five children, was shot dead by #Israel's occupation forces, while 20 others, including a cameraman, were shot &amp; wounded with live ammunition by #Israeli occupation forces.    #FreePalestine #News #PalestineNews #WorldNews
I wish Turkey that this difficult situation will end soon. And that they will return to the peaceful life soon  Free Love for all  #helpturkey #Israel üáÆüá±üáπüá∑
