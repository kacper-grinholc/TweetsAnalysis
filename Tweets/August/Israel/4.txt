#Israel has yet to acknowledge Hezbollah's role in the rocket attacks. Its latest statement says it targeted 'infrastructure used for terrorism' &amp; blames #Lebanon. This policy is counterproductive &amp; obscures the reality that this wouldn't happen without Hezbollah's involvement.

Proud of #Israel today for moving to ban the hunting of quail, &amp; suspend turtle dove hunting. Thanks to the @BonnConvention, countries are beginning to curb the hunting of turtle doves. No animals should be hunted, #endangeredspecies. @SPNI 🕊️🕊️🕊️

The #BeirutBlast killed hundreds &amp; left tens of thousands homeless. Yet there's been no accountability.  Instead of investigating &amp; pursuing justice, the Lebanese gov't seeks no answers.  Now, rockets have been fired from Lebanon into #Israel.  The Lebanese people deserve better. 
@swilkinsonbc About time- as #Israel  think they are above the law and are untouchable.
