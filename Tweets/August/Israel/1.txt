The #Iranian attack last week on a ship connected to #Israel is a wake-up call that needs to reverberate around the world.  
So Palestinians wouldn’t take 10s of thousands of #Israel’s vaccines that were weeks from expiring but they will take half a million vaccines from #China that barely work? 
#Israel has been one of the world leaders in #COVID19  vaccination efforts, a success that should show the way forward for many countries.

People were killed, innocent people who just wanted a nice Saturday out with their families found themselves fighting for their lives. 2 friends of mine were killed in the Maksim suicide bombing. They were 12 years old. #israel #intifada #terror #GlobalizeTheIntifada
Growing up during the second #intifada was frightening. I was to get on a bus, I was scared to eat outside with my friends… no 11 years old should be scared of doing any of these things, yet, the times forced me to deal with them.  #israel #GlobalizeTheIntifada
A thread: So I heard about this new trend “Globalize the Intifada”. First of all I’m horrified. #Intifada in Arabic means “violent uprising” and for Israelis it means #terror. Here’s some images of what happened during the intifada’s we had in #israel. #GlobalizeTheIntifada

@FRANCE24 Why UK, US and Israel? After all, it is a Liberia-flagged ship! What does Liberia say about it? Maybe it was sabotage from #Israel trying to pin it on #Iran. It wouldn't be the first time. Israel wants so bad US and UK to attack Iran. Israel wants a Iraq invasion 2.0.

#IRGC - According to a source at the Iranian Revolutionary Guards; the attack on Mercer Street Ship was a response to #Israel's bombing of an oil shipment sent by #Iran to the Lebanese #Hezbollah through the Syrian port of Banias.
The source added that the party had unloaded the oil in trucks and transported it to a warehouse near the #alDabaa airport in preparation for its delivery by land to #Lebanon, but #Israel bombed the warehouse, which also led to casualties. 2/2

Peer reviewed articles such as The Iceland Articles and new research from #Israel concludes that Ivermectin is the most effective preventive treatment and cure of #COVID19 and variants plus the toxic spike protein jab is not a vaccine.
@EinsteinsAdolfo the family lived in their own house, not yours.  Arabs ruled the land of #Israel for 36 years out of 3,500. study history my ignorant friend. The #Bible is not fiction but a historical document as a record-  billions are acknowledged whether you want to or not.

#BREAKING: #Update UK joins Israel in claims that Iran attacked tanker in fatal drone strike  #Israel #Tanker #DroneStrike #uk  #Iran
Good to know: this #Qatari #sociologist isn’t just an #Israel-hater. He’s a #misogynist, too. #judo #Olympics 
Did US vow a response when #Israel attacked #Iranian tankers? Or when Israeli assassins killed numerous Iranian scientists &amp; ruined their families? And if not why not? How long will US carry on fostering its criminal attack dogs in apartheid Israel? 
@JasonMBrodsky @SecBlinken Ship Attacks in the Persian Gulf: Another Manifestation of an Iranian-Israeli Proxy War? @mypoliticstoday   Will the ongoing 'ships war' between #Iran and #Israel escalate?

@MakeItRayn_ Liberated? They have their own country. It’s called #Jordan. Just ask the PLO circa 1970. Jordan Hashemite usurpers from the Gulf occupy 80% of mandate #Palestine. When WB was Jordan it occupied &gt;80%. Damn the #Orwellian1984 chains that bind you to #ThePalestinianLie  #Israel

- Reminder: #ISRAEL SUCKS.
listen! How did one of the #American activists  criticize #Israel.. #Israelicrimes 
Propaganda virker: "More Americans think #Iran possesses #nuclearweapons than think #Israel does. While Israel has been known to possess nuclear weapons for decades (without officially acknowledging it) and Iran is not known to have ever possessed any." 
  because if you miss understand and hear not, you will share arrows, and that can lead many to the wrong part. And by being obedient to God, to do what He asked you to do, you save yourself.. And not all called... #Jew #Christian #YouTube #Israel #Facebook
We love you Hakimi (@AchrafHakimi) and we also for #FreePalestine. Pathetic fans in #Israel.

#Israel - not only guilty for stealing Palestinians land, they also stole Annu Malik’s tune in creating their national anthem. Annu ji should sue them. #Annumalik 
#BoosterShots are already being given to people over 60 in #Israel.  This was one of the first countries to vaccinate their population &amp; they have studies to show a drop in efficacy to the #DeltaVariant. No official recommendations yet by health agencies for this booster shot.

A TV network linked to #Iran has said that the attack on a ship off the coast of #Oman was in “response to a recent Israeli attack on #AlDabaaairport in the Al-Qusayr region in #Syria.” #Israel
