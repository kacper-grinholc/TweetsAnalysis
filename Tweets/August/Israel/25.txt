When WW3 or mass catastrophe breaks out, I'll be glad #Israel is on our side. But, America is the world leader, not Israel. We must hold our allies to the highest standard to prove our values are real. Our Israel positions are contradictory to most of our foreign policy positions
When a family member is doing some stupid shit you say something or do your best to intervene. #Israel outright disrespects the legacy of Holocaust-era Jewish people by not honoring the #UDHR. It was a prophetic declaration, world-altering, crafted by people of many religions.
Don't fear the #Israel lobby; those who cast stones live in a glass house. If our two nations are really a family, then the new nation needs to embrace our family traditions; constitutional rights for all, and the #UDHR. We the people write the check and we can/will make demands

"#Israel’s military is accelerating its operational plans against #Iran due to the progress of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program," #IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kohavi has warned.
According to @anchalvohra, the dramatic escalation at the #Lebanon and #Israel border terrified the #Lebanese who have been grappling with a myriad of crises.

"Many of the same progressives who defend “The #Squad” keep telling us that “silence is violence” and “silence is complicity.” They're right. If only they would take their own words to heart when it comes to #Israel."  By Micha Danzig

Key findings:  “Israeli Arabs also find a two-state (69%) or one-state (56%) resolution acceptable, but not the status quo. Israeli Jews tend to find all options unacceptable, though the status quo is the most acceptable (42%)”  Anyone surprised? #Israel

Defense minister highlights danger posed by #Iran, army chief says #Israel accelerates preparations for mega-strike.
.@SecDef says today before his meeting with #Israel's prime minister, “#Iran must be held accountable for acts of aggression in the Middle East &amp; on international waters." But all that's come out has been statements. That's not accountability. 
@frances_black #Israel prevents children both girls and boys from an education by demolishing their schools! But the media outcry is the #Taliban  have prevented girls from going to school , some how this is more media worthy than #Israels torture, killing, imprisonment of pregnant womn in jail
With all due respect to martyrs' souls, I wish that #PLO &amp; #Fatah had never existed, #Palestine was occupied &amp; it's still occupied, but at least we wouldn't have been bound by these humiliating agreements they signed with #Israel, and restore nearly nothing of Palestinians rights

#Khaled_Saleh_Hashash, 15 years, died after being shot in the head by the #israeli forces during a raid on the Balata refugee camp.  Khaled is the 12th #Palestinian child to be killed this year. #Israel should be held accountable for its human rights violations. 
Fantastic news. Remember, folks: U.S. policy on #Israel doesn't and won't change - no matter how much the far-left antisemites in Congress clamor for it. And that's a good thing. 
#bennett announced that #Israel will continue “clandestine attacks” and espionage targeting #Iran and its nuclear program, which Tehran has long maintained is for peaceful domestic energy purposes. (And #USA and allies are perfectly OK with that?)

@SecDebHaaland @CleanAirMoms Except, if you're fairly healthy, it's not. The best way is to catch the virus &amp; achieve natural immunity, as is done by 99.5% of those who contract &amp; survive #COVID19.  See the exhaustive new study from #Israel.

#Israel Just published: #COVID19 Booster efficiency - 95% infection prevention, 97% serious disease prevention. Encouraging news for the 1.6 million Israelis who received the booster dose •
