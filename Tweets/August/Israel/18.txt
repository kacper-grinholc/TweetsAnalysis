Bad blood between rulers of #Morocco #Algeria has been there for many years; Now President Tebboune decided to "review" ties with the kingdom weeks after Algiers recalled its Amb to Rabat, citing hostile allyship with #Israel. Hope this won't escalate to closing Algeria's embassy  
I hoe that leaders of #Israel realized on their own that we can not relay on others and didn't really need to be reminded by the Radical #Islamist #terror groups.

@warrenmorgan A bit tricky for you Warren? Even from your screenshot it's clear that @STWuk article is calling for a "legitimacy war" against #Israel, a political campaign. And the aims of the campaign are end British involvement in foreign wars, not to resolve every conflict on the planet.
