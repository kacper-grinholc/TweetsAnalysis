Sometimes I think #Israel locks a group of @EretzNehederet (the closest thing to #Israeli SNL) writers together in a room and asks them to come up with most disastrous script they can imagine for national #diplomacy, and someone in the top brass is like, let's do exactly that: 
Chanting "from the river to the sea" means all of #Israel. "#FreePalestine" means eliminating all Jews from Israel. It is as plain as the #Palestinian charters of the #PLO AND #HAMAS. #genocide! YES GENOCIDE. - DO YOU WANT TO BE CHANTING IN FAVOR OF GENOCIDE? #Palestinians 
Like the devastating earthquake in #Iran, #Turkey‚Äôs evil leaders put their #hate for #Israel ahead of the welfare of their people who‚Äôre currently in harm‚Äôs way from these out-of-control #wildfires. It‚Äôs an age old story that never ceases to repulse.

#Israel's defense minister warned Thursday that his country is prepared to strike #Iran issuing the threat against the #IR after a fatal drone strike on a oil tanker at sea that his nation blamed on #Tehran. #ÿ™Ÿáÿ±ÿßŸÜ #ÿ•ÿ≥ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ŸäŸÑ 
[My latest] The decision to grant #Israel observer status is perhaps the worst &amp; most dangerous in the #AfricanUnion's history as it puts its political and ethical values into question.     #Palestine #Apartheid #BDS #WarCrimes #CrimesAgainstHumanity
Hi #Lebanon  if you control the groups that launch rockets on #Israel there will not be any need for airstrikes on your #terrorists. üëáüëáüëá

Avichai Adraee, the #Israeli army‚Äôs Arabic-language spokesman, said the Lebanese government is responsible for what happens on its territories and warned against more attacks on #Israel from south #Lebanon ! #Hezbollah
The #Israeli army said in a statement that jets struck the launch sites from which rockets had been fired over the previous day. No one has claimed responsibility for the rocket fire from #Lebanon, and #Hezbollah has not commented. #Israel
#Israel was doing well in overcoming #COVID19 until recently. Israel has  high #vaccination compliance. The question arises: WTF happened? Is immunity from the #vaccine shorter than expected? Is the #DeltaVariant stronger than expected? These questions need answers ...now!

@Kathleendlg Agreed. Abandoned and abused again, and wondering what is really going on behind the scenes. My question is if #Israel has released a statement? Some are talking about going back and starting new communities on our own without gov‚Äôt involvement. #Tired

@giladerdan1 @SenFeinstein @benandjerrys Ben üî•COHENüì¢ from Ben and Jerry's is Jewish tho. This is all the proof we need that #antisemitism is not anti-jewish and is in fact anti-#israel. Which, if Ted Cruz is allowed to be anti-china, any US citizen can be anti-Israel. It's called equality, democracy, and free speech.
