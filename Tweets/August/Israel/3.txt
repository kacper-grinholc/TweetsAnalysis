The AU's back door invite to #Israel has betrayed the Palestinians Opinion by @yvonneridley 
6. #Israel is also considering delaying the start of the school year by a month, in order to prevent a huge spike in cases when kids return to class.  #Quebec's back to school plan seems to be to throw all the kids into unventilated classrooms, unmasked, and see what happens.
@_benkaufman . And winters in #Israel are relatively mild ...
5. While #Canada has lifted mandatory self-quarantine for returning travellers, #Israel is reimposing mandatory quarantine for any Israeli returning from a list of nearly 50 countries, including the US, Italy, Germany and France. Tourists are still mostly barred.
4. In combination with the above, #Israel is rapidly mobilizing to vaccinate over a million people in a week -- both 1st/2nd doses to those still unvaccinated, and 3rd doses to those 60+ and #HighRiskCOVID who had their 2nd dose at least 5 months ago, due to waning immunity.
3. #Israel has 60% of its population fully vaccinated. Higher than #Quebec. And yet they're seeing over 2k new cases per day and it's rising quickly. Vaccines alone will NOT get us out of this.
2. #RapidTesting is a huge component of #Israel's #COVID19 strategy. They're rolling out a massive system to get tested before entering just about any public space, especially in the face of a surge in COVID among children.
A few notes about this: 1. #Israel acknowledges that just because kids &lt;12 are too young to be vaccinated doesn't make them exempt from being able to catch and spread #COVID19. From Aug 20 onward, they will need to undergo rapid testing to enter public spaces.
Analysis: #Iran escalates maritime conflict against Israel  #Israel and its allies mull a response after an Iranian attack against an Israeli-operated ship off the coast of Oman 
#Israel is reimposing a big set of #COVID19 restrictions, including #VaccinePassports for all (including kids), masks indoors and outdoors, work from home, and quarantine for vaccinated parents of infected kids.   Meanwhile in #Quebec: Crickets.

Per Fars News today, #Iran says #Israel and the #US have attacked 16 of its ships in international waters.  U.S. also acted as pirate, stole oil off Iranian tanker, sold it, kept the money. #UNSC: Surely such attacks vs Iran are a threat to security of international shipping. 
#Hamas members were throwing rocks on #Jewish worshippers,  ignoring #truth is #evil, particularly when #Israel is blamed for #Hamas incitement, and #hamasrockets falling on their own people! Disgusting #antisemitic #hate!!! 
#Israel announces it is reinstating #COVID-19 restrictions as case numbers surge throughout the country.
"Reuters: #Britain, #Romania and #Liberia consider in a letter to the Security Council the attack on Mercer Street a threat to the security of international shipping." (World knows how much attention #Israel pays to letters to UNSC about its attacks on #Iran's ships, #Syria &amp; &amp; ) 
Palestine in Perspective: In Conversation with Ilan Pappe  #ilanpappe #palestine #israel #podcast
#Britain with (big military threats) #Liberia and #Romania are "likely to attack #Iran" since U.S. &amp; U.K. &amp; #Israel blamed it for #DroneAttack on #Israeli oil tanker in Gulf of Oman last week. (Still haven't seen evidence; accusation denied by Iran.) What role #Apartheid state? 
In a new letter to the UN Security Council obtained by Times of Israel on the Mercer Street attack, #Israel's Ambassador to UN writes “The Security Council should not sit idly by in the face of such violations by #Iran or by the terrorist organizations..." 1/3
#Israel isn't going to put up with Iranian drone attacks on their ships much longer!  It's going to get ugly.

remember the international outrage from the likes of US and UK when Israel Special forces invaded 6 aid ships to Gaza and killed 10 members of the flotilla… no I don’t either… #iran  #israel #gaza #flottila #blockade #c4news #Hypocrisy
@BorisJohnson @Tsihanouskaya What about Palestine will you stop arming  #Israel ? Will you stop the human rights abuses that the #IDF inflict on children ? You can’t pick and choose which human rights you are going to stand up for, it should be for all human rights!
#OPINION: #Israel’s officials should reflect on how the occupation and obstruction of any moves toward peace have brought them to the point of being suspected war criminals and human rights abusers, writes @YMekelberg #Gaza 
@DanStreetmenti2 @m7mdkurd @BDSmovement Do share #Palestinian children murdered, maimed for life by IDF and incarcerated illegally under international law by #Israel. Will she also shoot a #Palestinian? Pathetic spin, she could study in UAE University or like tens of thousands Emiratis in US &amp; European universities.
Now that #Israel has a #budget for the first time in three years, will the #government know how to move forward from here? 
How many times can one say it? Not enough! "#Education is key" and this history-making young woman's learning will extend way beyond the classroom. #UAE #university student in #Israel: only the beginning. #AbrahamAccords 
Defense Minister @gantzbe visited the south of #Israel on Tuesday and met with #IDF commanders as well as with local farmers.

"How does a small Middle Eastern country like #Israel get all of the water it needs and more?"  Doing exactly like Jacob the Jew?  ( If I don't steal it, someone else will) 
US, #Israel to launch joint international probe into tanker attack 
#Israel warns against travel to the #US and other countries and says it will tighten quarantine measures for inbound travelers as part of efforts to slow the spread of the #coronavirus Delta variant. 
The #UnitedStates said on Tuesday that an "appropriate response will be forthcoming" to an attack on an Israeli-managed petroleum product tanker #MercerStreet off the coast of #Oman that killed a Briton and a Romanian last week. #israel #iran #UK 
The 11-day war between #Israel and #Palestine in May has resulted in Israel's supreme court to offer Palestinians facing eviction from the #SheikhJarrah a deal aimed at safeguarding 70 Palestinians from getting displaced from their home land. 
@DanStreetmenti2 @FedUpAmerican98 @m7mdkurd @BDSmovement @IntlCrimCourt Keep on justifying #ApartheidIsrael! if your tall tales were so convincing UN General Assembly wouldn't have passed 800 resolutions against #Israel; Stern &amp; Irgun gang massacres are also imagined and the #IsraelTerrorists attack on King David Hotel that killed British officers!
A good Israeli friend: The [international] silence about what's happening to the Iranian people is shocking.  #Iran #Israel
Sumaya Almahiri will make history and will be the first student from the United Arab Emirates to study and complete a university degree in #Israel. 🇦🇪 🕊️ 🇮🇱   We wish you every success! 
#Vaccination Instead of topping up the 3rd time with #PfizerVaccine can't #Israel  rather use Johnson &amp; Johnson? (3rd time lucky)
Oops journalists under spying by #Israel #Pegasus  Shame 
#Khamenei affiliated paper KAYHAN: #Israel &amp; USA must NOT test #Iran power &amp; cards in #Oman Sea; Iran can close the Hormuz Straits or prevent #Israeli ships' safe passage! 
🚨The esclatimg tankers’ &amp; ships’ war thru exchanging messages &amp; settling scores between #Israel &amp; #Iran-has moved out of #Syria to threaten energy security in the Arabian Gulf &amp; Gulf on #Oman. 🚨Is a major threat to the security &amp; stability of the region &amp; world world economy🧐
Simple question......if israel can't stand with Hamas 100 USD MISSILE....how they can go for war with Iran?........ Israeli army has only experience of killing innocent civilians.....now they will experience taste of real war........#Iran #Israel
@DinosGonatas @benandjerrys @UN @EVKontorovich Unfortunately, @nytimes @washingtonpost think it's normal for #Israel to lie back &amp; get attacked by missiles, accept terrorist attacks on her soil -- even w/in the Green Line. 6/
''we are not there yet, but this is where humanity is going.''  #prosperity #Diversity #Balance #Israel
🚨🇮🇱Millions on social media are asking #Israel and the #IDF to act immediately and clean up the 🇮🇷mess. 
#Breaking After #Suicide #Drone Attack on a #Panama Flag #Japan Owned #Israel managed #OilTanker off coast of #Oman killing 1 #British &amp; 1 #Romanian Citizen last week, unconfirmed reports suggest that #Iran's #IRGC backed militants have hijacked a #ship off coast of #Fujaira #UAE 
@SenatorTimScott @benandjerrys Free market, baby. @benandjerrys doesn’t like what it sees with #Israel and rightfully so, and thereby acted with integrity. There’s no story here, #TimScott. But the company’s nondairy ice cream is the bomb!

#Palestine: #Israel settler uses soldier's gun to shoot at Palestinians in #WestBank
