#Poland has proposed a state of emergency on it's border with #Belarus.  But 32 people seeking safety in Poland is not grounds for a state of emergency. The situation on the border is a *humanitarian* emergency which requires an urgent response.  
@AmbDanFried @USAmbBelarus @cepa @KDonfried It’s rather curious because since 2015, the government of #Poland has been the leading European advocate for nationalism, populism, homophobia, and limits on judicial independence. This speech has more to do with Poland’s regional ambitions than the well-being of Belarus.
