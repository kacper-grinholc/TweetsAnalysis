#UN refugee agency presses #Poland to help migrants on Belarus border -  
Tune in @Tsihanouskaya on 26 August to discuss  #migration into the EU organised by the #Lukashenka dictatorship. Do the affected EU countries and the EU have the tools to defend themselves? What consequences will the crisis have for #Lithuania #Poland and #Latvia? #MigrationPact 
Just one last set of more random #Warsaw photos. Spent 3 months there and learned a lot about local culture. There are a lot of good things in Warsaw. #polandüáµüá± #polskaüáµüá± @ Warsaw, Poland 
New pandemic restrictions likely to return in September in #Poland. Regions will be given green, yellow or red category, depending on the level of new infections. There may be downgrading of zone level if the vaccination rate exceeds the national average.  #Covid19
#Estonia, #Latvia, #Lithuania and #Poland called on the #UN to take action against Belarus, which they say is using migrants "to destabilise neighbouring countries" in a "hybrid attack."

The Polish language is beautiful...üòâ#Poland 
25 Aug 1939: #Britain and #Poland enter into an #alliance. Britain states it will defend Poland if Poland is attacked. The news delays Hitler‚Äôs plans to invade Poland, which was to occur the next day, but was delayed until Sept 1. #WWII #history #WW2 #ad  
On his third and last day of visit to #Ukraine, President @AndrzejDuda told TVP that ‚Äúpost-WWII, we must never accept a situation in which someone changes Europe‚Äôs borders by force, and on top of that, in our [#Poland‚Äôs] proximity‚Äù. 
#Poland üáµüá± #Innovation performance has increased  üìà by almost 29% since 2014 in the #EUInnovation Scoreboard, performing especially well in 3 areas:  Digitalisation, Intellectual assets and Use of information technologies  Good job! üëè  ‚û°Ô∏è 
Polish parliament will vote on a new law on foreigners, which would make it impossible for people crossing the border "irregularly" to be able to claim asylum in #Poland.   Meanwhile Poland continues to face allegations of unlawful push-backs of refugees. 
@AlePogoda @MeteoprognozaPL: The low pressure system over the North can cause this interesting pattern of rain over #Poland tomorrow. This #weather map shows the amounts of rain accumulated over the 24 hours of tomorrow. #Pogoda #Meteo 
@Vestas  has received two orders in Poland totalling 50MW from the JV between @V_ridium Power Group and KGAL.  #onshorewind #orders #Poland 
And if some Poles were stranded on a border like those migrants are, this absurd country would be the first to threaten everyone with a sabre ‚Äî history proves we‚Äôre pretty good with hollow heroism. #Poland
#evacuation #Kabul ends with 31Aug  The western states - #Germany  - are very concerned about this date   If so;  there are thousands refugees at the #EU Borders #Poland #Belarus #Greece . You can save them from there  #TalibanFear #helpers #employees &amp; #nonEmployees  #Frontex

What a finish!  #Polandüáµüá±'s Marcin Polak manages to grab a #bronze by just a quarter-second in the Men's pursuit B. It's the first Polish medal won at the #Tokyo2020 #Paralympics.  #ParaCycling #POL

There's truth, but no logic... First, #Poland would have to conquer #Belarus. Second, a cargo with Polish #HumanitarianAid for #migrants was denied entry to Belarus. 
‚û° Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, builders in #Poland completed 2.3 percent more #homes in the first seven months of this year than in the same period in 2020, the country‚Äôs Central Statistical Office (GUS) has reported. 
‚û° #Poland's prime minister on Tuesday said the country's #border was well guarded and secure from what he described as provocations by the #Belarusian regime. 
That race finish by #Poland from Polak was INSANE  wow  #Paralympics #trackcycling
