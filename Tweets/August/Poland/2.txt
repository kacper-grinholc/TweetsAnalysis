#Poland grants visa to #Belarus Olympian who fears for safety
#Olympics #Tokyo2020 the level of harassment girl #Athletes have to face in so many countries including #India - good that #Poland has come to her rescue and offered her asylum and her family is safe in #Ukraine now- all this over a disgusting coach #Olympics- #Tokyo2020 
This is bizarre if she complained against her coaches there must be a valid reason 🤔 this sounds more dictatorial than say many democracies I know today- good #Poland offered her visa #God bless #KristinaTimanovskaya #Olympics  #Tokyo2020 hope that coach is investigated #Belarus

#Poland A Humanitarian visa? The don't know what human rights are. The way they treat Gay people. They should be thrown out of Europe and sanctions imposed.

Will #Poland grant asylum to Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya after her country's authorities turned against her for speaking her mind? #Belarus’ nasty authoritarian regime has been relentlessly targeting anyone even mildly expressing dissent. @amnesty
#Poland has granted a humanitarian visa to Belarusian athlete Kryscina Tsimanouskaya, who was forcibly withdrawn from the Tokyo Olympics by #Belarus. She is due to arrive in Warsaw this week.  This was announced by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland Marcin Przydacz. 
The EU said an effort to repatriate sprinter #KrystsinaTsimanouskaya of #Belarus from the #Tokyo2020 #Olympics was further evidence of "brutal repression" by President #Lukashenko and it welcomed #Poland's decision to grant her a #humanitarian visa.
This time, the balance of power is not in favor of the Eastern Europeans.  The handle of the knife is firmly in the hands of the #EU Commission, &amp; the blade is pointed towards #Hungary &amp; #Poland.  More on the relations between #Europe &amp; Hungary &amp; Poland👇
