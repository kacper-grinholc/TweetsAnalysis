#Poland’s prime minister has dismissed the head of a junior coalition partner from government, creating uncertainty about the future of an administration that has set Warsaw on a collision course with the European Union. 
A day of political reckoning in #Poland -    and politically my country may not be the same at the end of it: turbulences await.

Meanwhile, the soap opera that is Polish politics continues...but the real question is...how many minutes will #PiS and #Kaczyński's Great Power ambitions last once the EU cuts the funding and the US pulls out the troops from #Poland? 
And here it is #Poland 
Many would argue that recent #nordstream2 deal goes right against energy security in CEE region, empowering Russia at the expense of #Poland, #Ukraine - plenty to think about when it comes to strategic interest, some missteps among allies notwithstanding 
#Migrants "probably from #Iraq and #Afghanistan" begin streaming into #Poland, the latest country to be targeted by the government of #Belarus. 
Those who are detained crossing into #Poland are tested for #COVID19 and officers try to determine their identity, nationality and age. After processing and following a court order, they are transported to guarded holding centres.
These “illegal migrants are let through into #Poland and #Lithuania by #Belarusian border guards” as part of a “hybrid war” that #Minsk is waging against the #EU, said Wąsik.
Both #Poland and #Lithuania have drawn #Minsk’s ire for supporting the #Belarusian democratic opposition.
Last week, #Poland’s deputy interior minister, Maciej Wąsik, claimed that #Belarus is deliberately letting migrants cross the border as retaliation against #Warsaw for offering refuge to #Belarusian athlete Krystina Tsimanouskaya.
#Lithuania has this year seen an even greater surge of illegal crossings, with over 4,000 migrants arriving. Yesterday, #Poland and Lithuania’s presidents issued a joint declaration calling for “urgent regional measures” to “protect the #EU’s external border”.
#Polish border guards apprehended almost three times as many people illegally crossing the border from #Belarus at the weekend as in the whole of last year. #Poland’s government accuses #Minsk of using migrants as “living weapons” in a “hybrid war”.
In 2018, #Poland achieved the third largest decline in its VAT gap among all #EU countries, closing it by 4.3 percentage points.
#Poland’s Law and Justice (#PiS) government has won praise for its efforts to close the VAT gap, which stood at 23.9% when the party came to power in 2015.
A recent report by the #Polish Economic Institute, a think tank, found that almost one in eight people (12%) in #Poland who are working with an employment contract – around 1.4 million people in total – receive some of their wages off the books.
Under-the-table payments are believed to be widespread in #Poland.
