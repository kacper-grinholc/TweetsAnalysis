Poland's parliament has agreed to the Conservative govt PiS decision to limit foreign ownership of Polish media, a move that criticasters say was solely aimed at TVN, the only TV channel that is not controlled by the govt and doesn't run its propaganda. #poland #pressfreedom
Latvia began the transfer of its troops to the border with Belarus, declaring a state of emergency.  Earlier, the EU said that the Belarusian side purposefully transports illegal migrants from the Middle East to #Poland, #Lithuania and #Latvia   
THE LEFT: #Poland is fascist   because it's democratically elected government chooses to pass a law that prevents Chinese control of media to protect freedom of speech. THE LEFT: #Facebook #Twitter cool for banning a US President, Conservative voices &amp; controlling free speech!

Parliamentary assault on #mediafreedom in #Poland 
Vote on postponement repeated in the evening hours and #TVN law ultimately passed by a majority of 228-216-10. Sad day for #MediaPluralism in #Poland and sad day for the #US-Polish relations.

A dark day for media freedom in #Poland as Polish parliament passes a bill that would force @Discovery to sell a Polish TV network that includes an all-news station that has been critical of the country's right-wing government. #lexTVN

#Poland right wing MP @D_Sosnierz attacked by liberal demonstrators after he abstained from voting on the law banning countries out of European Economic Area to have majority stake in PL media firms. It was interpreted as not supporting liberal TVN media company.

Hi, I wanted to say that in Poland we no longer have free media. Since 1989 we've never been so close to dictatorship.  It's fucked up here. As a medic, bi, atheist woman I don't feel safe here. Please, don't close your eyes to what's happening in the center of Europe #EU #Poland
@SecBlinken There is no democracy without a free press. Freedom of the press is a core guiding light of democracy. Kill it and you kill democracy. #POLAND
#Poland is no longer in Europe. The Polish Parliament has just passed a law restricting media freedom, the so-called #lexTVN. Don't let the EU give any money to this corrupt system. #Polexit

#LexTVN was passed with 228 MPs in favour, 216 against and 10 abstentions. It’s another dark day for freedom of expression in #Poland. We call on the Senate to reject the bill, and the EU &amp; U.S. to counter the attack on the independence of TVN channels. The fight is not over ✌🏻 
🇵🇱 #lexTVN: Media freedom &amp; democracy took another serious blow today in #Poland. After chaotic day, Sejm voted in favour of bill that would force sale of U.S-owned broadcaster #TVN. Yet another sign PiS is following Hungary's path of bringing private media under greater control 
I am on record to call #PIS from #Poland enemy of freedom since 2005 - some might remember. Now that Poland has outlawed USA FDI in media sector I guess #Kaczyński crossed the rubicon @USAmbPoland time for the tweet by @SecBlinken  put #Kaczyński  on blacklist @DiscoveryIncTV

MPs in #Poland voted to postpone the Sejm session until September at the request of PSL leader Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz. This means that the parliamentary majority of Law and Justice is uncertain. It was possible, inter alia, due to the absence of two MPs from PiS.
