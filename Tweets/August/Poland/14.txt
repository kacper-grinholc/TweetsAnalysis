#Israel's FM @yairlapid said tonight that #Poland had "become an anti-democratic, illiberal country", but according to @freedomhouse, Poland is much freer than Israel. However, @vdeminstitute and @TheEIU rank Israel clearly ahead of Poland.

#Israel furious as #Poland signs law to limit property claims  ▪️President Duda has approved a law that will set a limit for Jews to recover property lost during and after WW2. ▪️Israel has recalled its diplomatic envoy to Warsaw over the changes, branding the law anti-Semitic.

Problem was #Roosevelt still needed #Stalin’s support for the war against #Japan so ceded to him over his #Poland land grab and installation of a puppet Communist Govt and even turned a blind eye to Russian slaughter of Polish military elites earlier in 1941. 
Sadly we did sell #Poland and it’s people who fought like tigers for the Allies down the river and allow #Stalin to land grab and take control. Ironically the nation we went to war with #Germany to protect we betrayed at tripartite talks with #Stalin and #Roosevelt

The Associated Press reports #Israel has recalled its ambassador from #Poland, due to that country’s new restitution law.
@Israel wants land in #Poland that apparently belongs to them and are forcefully removing #Palestinians from Palestinian land they claim also belongs to them. The Balfour Declaration has to be revisited for its meaning and understanding. 
“Poland’s restitution law sparks row with Israel and the US The new law will make it much harder to get back confiscated property —”  #Poland #holocaust 
.#Poland’s new law offensive to Jews &amp; the #Jewish #State.    Israel recalls its ambassador &amp; &amp; ejects Polish ambassador to Israel in protest.  Israel coordinates further action w/ the US.  
The #President of #Poland, @AndrzejDuda pissed off. Big time.  No way back. Keep the course. 
An example of #antipolonism at it's finest. This is how #jews #izrael (#zionists) propaganda looks like. Goebbels would be proud.  #izrael #israel #Poland 
"We've never had so many trees but so few #forests," Adam Wajrak said on #TVN tonight borrowing a quote from Sweden which he says could apply to #Poland. The complexity, the intricacy of forest #ecosystems being lost to #deforestation cannot be replaced. #biodiversity
The #Polish bill to limit #WWII property restitution claims caused #Israel's Foreign Ministry to #recall the envoy to #Poland, in a move that deepened the crisis between the two countries.  
Anna was raped by Herman. Herman also killed her brother Noah. Anna's children rebuild the house. Today Jacob from Israel, called Anna's grandson. Jacob claims his right for the house, based on being same religion as Noah. He sais Anna seduced Herman.  #holocaust #israel #poland 
Recalling Israel’s mission to #Poland and asking @PolandMFA’s diplomats to Israel not to return from vacation is the correct measure for @IsraelMFA to take. This move by Poland is large-scale theft from many Polish Jews and their families. @AndrzejDuda must step in.

#Israel, #Poland, #Holocaust, property. More about the background in my earlier text: 
The double standard is too obvious:  #Poland is doing to the Polish #Jewish community what #Israel has been doing to the #Palestinians for over 70 years. But Israelis are upset about it of course.

Shame on you #Poland @PLinCanada. You perpetuate and nourish #antisemitism. Bravo to @yairlapid for such a principled position. #FightingAntisemitism 
@Janek12822205 I won't tolerate anyone who is distorting and whitewashing the truth about #WWII, #Holocaust crimes committed by the #Nazi #Germany and their collaborators including from #Poland. No way, I won't tolerate "likes" from folks like you who spread racism, antisemitism.

What’s happening in #Hungary, #Ghana, #Poland, and many other countries proves that we can not take progress for granted and that we have a long way to go. 
Theives, blood of the dead will never give peace to those who over property and lands.  Not to them , not to their offspring, its their curse to bear. No restitution will atone it.   #Poland's president signs bill to limit WW2 property restitution claims   
The Germans are getting their popcorn ready. They will make sure to accompany their tweets with hashtags #Holocaust #Poland to further perpetuate this association. 
On #Holocaust Remembrance Day (2018), I confronted #Poland’s PM @MorawieckiM in Auschwitz over their (then) #Holocaust revision law!  All those of good conscience have duty now to speak out against Poland’s obscene defamation of history &amp; memory of Jews murdered on *their* soil!

"#PiS &amp; hard-right #SolidarnaPolska strongly supported #antiLGBT resolutions passed #LocalAuthorities, ...after one town lost #EU funds due its #antiLGBT stance, #JusticeMinister Zbigniew #Ziobro, granted it funds from his ministry..." #Poland #Polska 
This is just relentless #Holocaust revision by #Poland. Try as they might, they cannot rewrite history. And #Israel, as the nation state of the Jewish people, cannot allow this grave injustice to stand! 
#Isreal reaction to the passage of restitution law in #Poland (recall of Ambassadors) is excessive. The law, which caps maximum time when restitution claims can be processed, enjoys bipartisan support. Moreover it does not distinguish between Jewish and non-Jewish claimants
Wrong. If we did, there would be none of you to #bully #Poland into submission.  Now go and read some history books. 
An unnecessary escalation of the property restitution law controversy. @yairlapid stubbornly refuses to accept #Poland's new law is designed against real estate fraud and not against legitimate claims of #Holocaust victims. Pandering to anti-Polish voter sentiment at its worst. 
Israeli government condemns #Poland 🇵🇱 new law, as disrespectful to the Holocaust memory.   Is the state of #Israel respecting the memory of the Holocaust ? The historical and humanitarian memory and valuable lessons to all of us from this horrific time?  
#Israel and #USA versus #Poland ? An  unprecedented crisis is unfolding around a new Polish law. #Holocaust and #Property issues are the background.
