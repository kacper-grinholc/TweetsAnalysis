In opposition to such moves, #Poland has recently seen a growth in the activity of anti-vaccine groups. On Saturday, thousands of people marched against compulsory vaccination in the city of #Katowice. Some #vaccination points have been attacked.
#Poland‚Äôs vaccine rollout, which initially proceeded at roughly the same rate as the #EuropeanUnion average, has since mid-June fallen significantly behind. The government admits there has been a ‚Äúvery concerning‚Äù decline in registrations.
According to RMF, #Poland has already sold one million doses of #Pfizer to #Spain and half a million to #Portugal. The shipments have reportedly already left the warehouses of the Government Agency of Strategic Reserves (#RARS).
#Poland has sold its first tranche of 1.5 million unused #COVID19 vaccines to #Spain and #Portugal, broadcaster RMF FM reports.
Where does the money come from? Why did most products and services double the price this year in #Poland? This is most often the case when money is uncontrolled reprinted, it lacks gold coverage and it loses purchasing power.  PHOTO made at UEP Poznan  Money economy business cash 
The legislation is seen as being aimed in particular at #Poland‚Äôs largest private broadcaster, #TVN, whose #American owner, Discovery, Inc., would be forced to sell its majority stake.

#Kaczynski has to go!! He's as bad as Orban, possibly worse. The EU has to make it crystal clear to the Poles: either they conform to EU values (which means #PiS is gone) OR they get no money. And if it continues, they're OUT. #Poland is a net recipient, by a long shot. But

Working on multiple countries in the region often provides critical perspective...when seeing the stream of tweets on #Poland's slide to illiberalism and breakdown of democracy, it's hard not to acknowledge that PiS' Poland still compares favourably to #Bulgaria's reality.

Polish lawmakers defy üá∫üá∏ andüá™üá∫ by pushing through a controversial #media bill that would force Discovery Inc. - the üá∫üá∏ owner of üáµüá±'s largest private television network - to sell its local TV group.   #tech #broadcast #Poland   via @bpolitics
@ACernyCZPress üáµüá± Roman Imielski takes #Poland's government to task over controversial media bill. @gazeta_wyborcza   More commentary:  
Presented Letters of Credence to Dr Marisa Farrugia, Ambassador-designate of #Malta to #Poland. We discussed bilateral relations - also in view of the upcoming 50th anniversary of their establishment - as well as regional developments. 
#Poland: The parliament has passed the controversial law that prevents companies from outside the EEA from owning a majority in üáµüá± media companies.  The bill was criticised by Washington as it would "significantly weaken Poland's media environment."

"The government argues that the bill is designed to prevent countries like Russia and China taking over local media; the opposition says that it is meant to bring TVN under the control of Polish owners who support the government." #PressFreedom #Poland
#EU brands #Poland #media_bill 'a negative signal' 
The situation in #Poland just got bad. Again. 
@PCMcArdle @jay5672 @julianHjessop None of us has got a crystal ball. So we don't know what will happen in a distant future.  At the moment the #UK is much more far right than most #EU members (#Hungary and #Poland excepted). So it would be no help against the rise of the far right which I deplore as you do.
Last night, #Poland's parliament voted in favor of amendments to the law on television and radio broadcasting, also known as the "lex TVN". The amendments provide for restrictions on the possession of Polish #media.
