Russia Has a Clear Reason to Invade Ukraine Now If Talks Fail - #Russia #Ukraine 
#Nordstream2 was a problem long before #Russia started moving its troops to #Ukraine borders. Not giving #Russia extra leverage in #Europe will make it more difficult to invade #Ukraine, but #Russia seized on the opportunity in Ukraine AFTER sensing #Biden weakness on NS2. 
@TomacMarti That's because #Biden &amp; his advisors, Blinken &amp; Sherman, refuse to punish mass-murderer #putin for invading #Ukraine. They refuse to do what's necessary: #StopNordstream2 #EmbargoENEMYruSSia  #SANCTIONruSSia
You will notice that @jensstoltenberg has little practical experience to help settle wartime affairs.   #Ukraine #Russia 
@DavidPepper I think he should focus on our vital ally, #Ukraine, sanction &amp; embargo mass-murderer #putin &amp; his cronies NOW, &amp; #StopNordstream2 before #ENEMYruSSia &amp; its collaborator, germany, use it to enslave #Ukrainians.

Unreal. It's like for Russia telling #Ukraine move your troops back in barracks away from #Donbass region and Ukraine will say it's our territory. And Russia will say our troops are within Russian borders. Imagine Mexico will tell US to move their base away from Texas. Unreal

Friends according to  Independent journalist &amp; Arabic journalist based in  #china  r reporting  talks are not going well with  deputy @StateDept  &amp; @mfa_russia in #Geneva.It is due to @JakeSullivan46 leaked  #sanctions in advance  @nytimes  should #Russia invade #Ukraine .....
Putin: "his track record isn't a mystery. Murder, invasion, oppression."  Germany: Wandel durch Handel EU, France, Austria, Hungary, Italy: appeasement USA: Resets  #Ukraine should have been aware of all of this. Defend yourself at all times. Expect nothing. 
@SkyNews  Saying that tensions are escalating between #Russia and #Ukraine  is simply wrong. Russia has massed its forces on Ukraine's borders, threatening a  second invasion. Sometimes it's easy to spot the bad guys.
@NATO Get on your boots vs Russia #Ukraine!! Russia will never be able to sustain that tension without having to deal with great famine. Let's give Putin his pension, so he can go ride his horse through the shore 7 days a week ... @terzaketv @deafspraaktv
It seems that #Putin does not understand the hints. The #USA and the #EU have been preparing a plan for #Russia's attack on #Ukraine for a whole year, and even printed this secret plan in newspapers, but instead of Ukraine he attacked #Kazakhstan. Damn #Russians.😨😨😡😜😜 
#Ukraine has to guard itself against all the foxes.   Be a slyer fox. 
#Russia can be a great country, if they throw off the yoke of the Putin #kleptocracy   #Ukraine - this is what you have to look forward to under #putin. More erosion of liberty and disregard for the rule of law.  @mfa_russia @RusEmbUSA @RussianEmbassy - the world is watching.

If Russia Invades Ukraine: How Much Damage Can Sanctions Do? - #Russia #Ukraine 
"One has to wonder abt 2 things: fact-checking at @TheAtlantic &amp; how @AnneApplebaum can get it so wrong. She seems to have relied on a journalist who summarized the RIA tweet... as if the prediction abt #Ukraine’s rapid ‘destruction’ came from RIA itself."
#Russia staged live-fire exercises with troops and tanks near the Ukrainian #border on Tuesday, sounding a downbeat note over the prospect of talks with the #UnitedStates that #Washington hopes will remove the possible threat of an invasion of #Ukraine.

Russia no longer needs to invade #Ukraine. Meetings by U.S. &amp; EU to threaten sanctions means they already accept it. Russia has at least as much influence with that “green light” than it would if it actually invaded.

I'm lost: what #Ukraine has to do with "de-escalation"?🤔 UA didn't try assassinating Putin or sabotaging critical RU infrastructure, didn't counterattack #Russia territory, didn't try retaking Donbas or Crimea. What non-suicidal steps could Kyiv possibly take?

#Russia may halt #Security talks with the #US unless Washington swiftly accepts its demand that #Ukraine and #Georgia not be allowed to join #NATO, #Kremlin announced.  Kremlin spox said there was little reason for optimism ahead of a NATO-Russia Council meeting on Jan 12.
@LegendaryJohnn2 Thats the problem with bullies. They are not looking for discussion, they are looking for agreement to THEIR terms. #Ukraine is not a bargaining chip.

Good development. Every country that cares a whit about freedom, security, peace and human rights should be arming #Ukraine; deterring #Russia.
