Bob, the real question should be, why didn't #Ukraine put simple measures in place to protect themselves? They've had their TV &amp; electrical infrastructure taken out by Russia before.  Technology now exists to make Ukraine's infrastructure impenetrable:

@DagfinnAMork @OlexijSmirnov @benjit14 @NTenzer I think Ukraine needs a multi-track approach now:  (1) Declare neutrality. No #EU and no #NATO.  (2) Federalize: transfer powers to the region.  (3) Cooperate with both the West (you are welcome!) and Russia.  #Ukraine

#US accuses #Russia of creating #Ukraine ‚Äòpretext for invasion‚Äô; according to the #WhiteHouse, #Moscow had pre-positioned operatives to carry out acts of sabotage against Russia‚Äôs own proxy forces - Front page of the #FTWeekend, 15/16 January @FT #Diplomacy140 #FalseFlag 
@FareedZakaria #Russia's demands are specifically about #Ukraine. The absurd ones make these less so.  Putin wants Ukraine's strongest ally to dash its NATO hopes‚Äîin writing. That serves Russia's core goal: Divide allies, show US as unreliable, democracies as untrustworthy, demoralize Ukraine. 
#Russia vs #Ukraine/#BalticStates/#Scandinavia and more Doesn't look good 
this is a video of about one hour about the endless battles that the #ukraine #Cyborg Brigade fought against all odds against #putin mercenaries and lost in the end but not without an enormous long and hard fight as HEROES 
today #ukraine remembers the #Cyborg brigade that defended against all odds the Donetsk airports untill the #russia forces were too big and they were tortured and killend by the #putin mercenaries ... but they were HEROES not cowards (as #europe is against Putin) 
#Canada vs #Ukraine  The #JustinTrudeauPMLogic ... issue a travel advisory and at the same time, send your FM, #MelanieJolie to #Ukraine for no reason other than trying to cure favor with #CanadianUkrainians Makes sense, right  ... NOT !!! 
Hey Vlad, take a chilliafed already. Yeesh. Calm down, KGB critter. #Ukraine
TASS - #Russia has to keep its troops near Ukrainian border due to tense situation - Kremlin.  #Ukraine
- #Russia is still moving massive amounts of equipment towards #Ukraine's borders.  - Meanwhile #Sweden moves military equipment to Gotland island over the threat of war with Russia.  - Drones were seen flying over Swedish nuclear power plants Matthew 24:6 - Rumors of Wars #NATO
#Pentagon estimates 2/3rd of #Russian forces near #Ukraine were "out-of-garrison," meaning they deployed... #Russia says #Ukraine talks hit 'dead end', #Poland warns of risk of war 
Why Did Russia Escalate Its Gray Zone Conflict in Ukraine?  #DANIELBYMAN #UKRAINE 
The light of war is on!   Congratulations to the US, the EU, NATO and esp. Eastern Flank idiotsüöÄüî•üéÜüî•üöÄüéÜ ‚ÄºÔ∏è #ukraine  NATO will not agree to the withdrawal of its military from countries that have joined the alliance since 1997, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said. 
#Russia and the #West are at a stalemate over #Ukraine. Is #Putin‚Äôs endgame now war?
#Russia‚Äôs Possible Invasion of #Ukraine. By Seth G. Jones @SethGJones  via @CSIS +++ Z. Andronikashvili @Zaaliko: "The situation is very alarming. Ukraine needs solidarity of all democratic states against Russian neo-imperialism."
So if UK implements sanctions on #Russia will that not effect our own economy with so much russian capital in the UK system? #Ukraine #Putin
As #EU High Representative @JosepBorrellF is clearly called to task on #Ukraine issue  by #Germany and #France - who run the #EuropeanUnion - one could be forgiven for wondering if our High Representative is employed by Washington or Brussels...
üìπ Russian propaganda are massively took the control of tiktok with military trains and claiming that this is a preparation for an attack on #Ukraine.  There are over a hundred videos like this. Most of them are from Siberia and the Far East. #Russia 
Although üá®üá¶#Canada &amp; üá∫üá¶#Ukraine are Continuing to Spend on their Militaries, but their Not Rising Up the Global Firepower Rankings Fast enough, they Could do better I think when you Compare them to üá¶üá∫#Australia &amp; üáÆüá±#Israel for sure though, (Population-Wise). ü§îüò≤ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ùì
Opinionüí≠by Patricia Adams &amp; @LSolomonTweets  Contrary to the spin, #Russia is playing defence, not offense, in its confrontation with the West over #Ukraine.  Misunderstanding Russia‚Äôs motivations could have tragic repercussions. 
Russia Issues Subtle Threats More Far-Reaching Than a Ukraine Invasion...  #russia #issues #subtle #threats #more #far-reaching #than #a #ukraine #invasion
I am confused - why is @McFaul advocating that #Ukraine capitulates to unacceptable demands of #Russia to limit its sovereignty? It seems to contradict his own earlier recommendations... 
"The idea of #Ukraine being a threat to #Russia is as absurd as Canada being a threat to the United States." Radoslaw Sikorski, Chairman, E.U.-U.S. Delegation, European Parliament.

It‚Äôs up to Russia to prevent war in Ukraine, NATO chief says  #Russia #Ukraine #NATO 
There are two types of people on Twitter  1. One who only tweets about state sponsored cyber attack on Ukraine and thats it.  2. Who will see the tweet and contribute with some tangible recommendations to #Ukraine cyber community   Note: Don't worry I fall in first category tooüò¥
According to a Ukrainian Security Officer, a hacker gang associated with Belarusian Intelligence conducted a cyberattack this week  #Ukraine #CyberAttack #Belarus #Russia #EuropeBriefNews  Read More:

#Ukraine. The hunt for Poroshenko was from the beginning a nasty affair borne of private emotions; now it is subversive of the state at the most dangerous time. Cui bono? Well, obviously #Putin's #Russia. Honi soit qui may y pense. @anders_aslund 
#Russia must de-escalate its military build-up in around #Ukraine, respect its international commitments &amp; core principles of European security.  Watch #NATO Secretary General @jensstoltenberg‚Äôs interview with @RosieBarton @CBCPolitics.  @CanadaNATO 
#Russia's security concerns are just a pretext for armed action. This is a particularly dangerous moment for #peace in #Europe. The big question is how to stop the Russian escalation process?  #VladimirPutin #NATO #Ukraine
No !  #Ukraine giving up #NATO &amp; #EU future membership in return for less #Russia agression is wrong: 1.UKR has chosen its future in euro-atl fora 2.RUS had a deal already and broke it: Budapest memorandum 1994. 3.Appeasement now will only lead to more broken promises by #Putin

Foreign Minister brought millions to Ukraine's military: 'Those who fight here, fight for the freedom of us all' - #military #ukraine #fight #kyiv #us 
In his @CBCNews i/v with @RosieBarton, #NATO chief @jensstoltenberg said ‚Äú#Canada is really a lead nation when it comes to support to #Ukraine,‚Äù noting üá®üá¶‚Äôs 200 military trainers in-country + $ millions in aid. üá∫üá¶ has right to self-defence &amp; Allies should help uphold that right.
@frankmonah Questions for #Poroshenko:  Does the Ukrainian government dare to arrest him? Will people go on the streets (#Maidan-like) to protect him?  #Ukraine #Kiev #Kyiv
Russian aggression and postering in #Ukraine isn‚Äôt and wasn‚Äôt about #NATO expansion. It was triggered by Ukrainian leadership entering #EU association agreement. Making this about nato is buying into the Kremlin narrative. West needs to signal strong suppoet for #Helsinki accords 
UKRAINE RUSSIA - US promises to respond if it confirms that Russia orchestrated a cyberattack on Ukraine - #orchestrated #ukraine #russia #moscow #world #kyiv #us 
#Breaking Ukraine said Sunday it had "evidence" that Russia was behind a massive cyberattack that knocked out key government websites this past week, while Microsoft warned the hack could be far worse than first thought  #BreakingNews #Ukraine #Russia #Nato #Usa #CyberAttack
Asked what üá∫üá¶ could do to de-escalate, #NATO Secretary General @jensstoltenberg tells @RosieBarton:  ‚ÄúThe aggressor is #Russia‚Ä¶ Russia occupies part of #Ukraine, Crimea‚Ä¶ To expect that the victim of aggression should de-escalate is to really put the whole thing upside-down‚Äù. 
#Russia issues subtle threats more far-reaching than a #Ukraine invasion
