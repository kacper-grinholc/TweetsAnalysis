I AM WITH #UKRAINE 🇺🇦 and whoever doesn’t like it can KISS MY #CUBAN ASS!   Believe me, I have A LOT MORE to say about those f/ing #SHITHEADS  too!   #Putin is an #ASSHOLE!   I am nominating him for #AssholeOfTheMonth!
It's a mistake for anyone to underestimate #Ukraine's will to fight - with or without foreign support - and for #Putin to ignore his many profound weaknesses as he contemplates starting a war that promises consequences and tragedy he will own entirely. #UkraineWillResist #Russia 
Regarding Russia's threat to #Ukraine and the danger of war ... Ukraine is a basket case economically. Look at these maps from  Maybe the poorest country in Europe with limited resources, surrounded by Russia not to mention ethnic/political division 
What could be the consequences of #Russia's actions in Ukraine? @ARVershbow with @AtlanticCouncil says that rhetoric has unintentionally increased support in neutral democracies of #Ukraine, #Sweden, and #Finland for closer relations with #NATO.

@radeksikorski #Poland should place demolition charges on the Molotov-Ribbentrop pipelines and promise to blow them if #Russia invades #Ukraine. Invasions must have consequences. If the invasion is not deterred, it will happen. Draw the line! #Deterrence is much better than war.  @anneapplebaum

@OlexijSmirnov @benjit14 @DagfinnAMork @NTenzer Or how the US bombed Iraq? Or Panama... Dude, I totally see your point. But you seem to focus only on Russia. Why not tackle 70 US of #US intervening all over the world first?  #Ukraine

@benjit14 @OlexijSmirnov @DagfinnAMork @NTenzer I do not agree with you. Western Europe is sick of allowing much poorer (sorry!) countries into #EU.

@benjit14 @OlexijSmirnov @DagfinnAMork @NTenzer Good question.  One little problem: my country The Netherlands already voted against #Ukraine in #EU. And Ukraine in #NATO? France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, probably the UK.. will never accept that. Never ever. Totally out of the question.

@OlexijSmirnov @DagfinnAMork @benjit14 @NTenzer OK, so the US did not force a constitution on Bosnia?The US did not let the Serbian province of Kosovo declare independence? The US did not create the constitution of Iraq?  #Ukraine
Bob, the real question should be, why didn't #Ukraine put simple measures in place to protect themselves? They've had their TV &amp; electrical infrastructure taken out by Russia before.  Technology now exists to make Ukraine's infrastructure impenetrable:

"If it turns out that Russia is pummeling #Ukraine with cyberattacks, and if that continues over the period ahead, we will work with our allies on the appropriate response."  Sullivan warns of "severe economic consequences" if Russia invades Ukraine

@DagfinnAMork @benjit14 @OlexijSmirnov @NTenzer The West can pay a role here. West should tell #Donetsk and #Luhansk:  "Please negotiate with Kiev. But if there is no deal then you can declare independence unilaterally like #Kosovo province did."  #Ukraine #Donbas #Russia
@DagfinnAMork @OlexijSmirnov @benjit14 @NTenzer I think Ukraine needs a multi-track approach now:  (1) Declare neutrality. No #EU and no #NATO.  (2) Federalize: transfer powers to the region.  (3) Cooperate with both the West (you are welcome!) and Russia.  #Ukraine

#Russia and the #West are at a stalemate over #Ukraine. Is #Putin’s endgame now war?
#Russia’s Possible Invasion of #Ukraine. By Seth G. Jones @SethGJones  via @CSIS +++ Z. Andronikashvili @Zaaliko: "The situation is very alarming. Ukraine needs solidarity of all democratic states against Russian neo-imperialism."
So if UK implements sanctions on #Russia will that not effect our own economy with so much russian capital in the UK system? #Ukraine #Putin
As #EU High Representative @JosepBorrellF is clearly called to task on #Ukraine issue  by #Germany and #France - who run the #EuropeanUnion - one could be forgiven for wondering if our High Representative is employed by Washington or Brussels...
📹 Russian propaganda are massively took the control of tiktok with military trains and claiming that this is a preparation for an attack on #Ukraine.  There are over a hundred videos like this. Most of them are from Siberia and the Far East. #Russia 
Although 🇨🇦#Canada &amp; 🇺🇦#Ukraine are Continuing to Spend on their Militaries, but their Not Rising Up the Global Firepower Rankings Fast enough, they Could do better I think when you Compare them to 🇦🇺#Australia &amp; 🇮🇱#Israel for sure though, (Population-Wise). 🤔😲🤷‍♂️❓
Opinion💭by Patricia Adams &amp; @LSolomonTweets  Contrary to the spin, #Russia is playing defence, not offense, in its confrontation with the West over #Ukraine.  Misunderstanding Russia’s motivations could have tragic repercussions. 
Russia Issues Subtle Threats More Far-Reaching Than a Ukraine Invasion...  #russia #issues #subtle #threats #more #far-reaching #than #a #ukraine #invasion
I am confused - why is @McFaul advocating that #Ukraine capitulates to unacceptable demands of #Russia to limit its sovereignty? It seems to contradict his own earlier recommendations... 
"The idea of #Ukraine being a threat to #Russia is as absurd as Canada being a threat to the United States." Radoslaw Sikorski, Chairman, E.U.-U.S. Delegation, European Parliament.

It’s up to Russia to prevent war in Ukraine, NATO chief says  #Russia #Ukraine #NATO 
There are two types of people on Twitter  1. One who only tweets about state sponsored cyber attack on Ukraine and thats it.  2. Who will see the tweet and contribute with some tangible recommendations to #Ukraine cyber community   Note: Don't worry I fall in first category too😴
According to a Ukrainian Security Officer, a hacker gang associated with Belarusian Intelligence conducted a cyberattack this week  #Ukraine #CyberAttack #Belarus #Russia #EuropeBriefNews  Read More:  
‘We’ll fight to the end.’ Ukraine defiant in face of Vladimir Putin’s phoney war #Ukraine #Putin  
#Ukraine. The hunt for Poroshenko was from the beginning a nasty affair borne of private emotions; now it is subversive of the state at the most dangerous time. Cui bono? Well, obviously #Putin's #Russia. Honi soit qui may y pense. @anders_aslund 
#Russia must de-escalate its military build-up in around #Ukraine, respect its international commitments &amp; core principles of European security.  Watch #NATO Secretary General @jensstoltenberg’s interview with @RosieBarton @CBCPolitics.  @CanadaNATO 
#Russia's security concerns are just a pretext for armed action. This is a particularly dangerous moment for #peace in #Europe. The big question is how to stop the Russian escalation process?  #VladimirPutin #NATO #Ukraine
No !  #Ukraine giving up #NATO &amp; #EU future membership in return for less #Russia agression is wrong: 1.UKR has chosen its future in euro-atl fora 2.RUS had a deal already and broke it: Budapest memorandum 1994. 3.Appeasement now will only lead to more broken promises by #Putin

Foreign Minister brought millions to Ukraine's military: 'Those who fight here, fight for the freedom of us all' - #military #ukraine #fight #kyiv #us 
In his @CBCNews i/v with @RosieBarton, #NATO chief @jensstoltenberg said “#Canada is really a lead nation when it comes to support to #Ukraine,” noting 🇨🇦’s 200 military trainers in-country + $ millions in aid. 🇺🇦 has right to self-defence &amp; Allies should help uphold that right.
@frankmonah Questions for #Poroshenko:  Does the Ukrainian government dare to arrest him? Will people go on the streets (#Maidan-like) to protect him?  #Ukraine #Kiev #Kyiv
Russian aggression and postering in #Ukraine isn’t and wasn’t about #NATO expansion. It was triggered by Ukrainian leadership entering #EU association agreement. Making this about nato is buying into the Kremlin narrative. West needs to signal strong suppoet for #Helsinki accords 
UKRAINE RUSSIA - US promises to respond if it confirms that Russia orchestrated a cyberattack on Ukraine - #orchestrated #ukraine #russia #moscow #world #kyiv #us 
#Breaking Ukraine said Sunday it had "evidence" that Russia was behind a massive cyberattack that knocked out key government websites this past week, while Microsoft warned the hack could be far worse than first thought  #BreakingNews #Ukraine #Russia #Nato #Usa #CyberAttack
Asked what 🇺🇦 could do to de-escalate, #NATO Secretary General @jensstoltenberg tells @RosieBarton:  “The aggressor is #Russia… Russia occupies part of #Ukraine, Crimea… To expect that the victim of aggression should de-escalate is to really put the whole thing upside-down”. 
#Russia issues subtle threats more far-reaching than a #Ukraine invasion
