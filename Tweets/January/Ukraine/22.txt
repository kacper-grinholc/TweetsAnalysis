@leonardbenardo1 @dmarusic Actually, I think @dmarusic will find that the @just_security includes quite a lot of hard data to support his contention about the irrelevance of "international community" to #Ukraine (though I would never use the term...). 
This is a weak response that begets more aggression worldwide. If we stand down on #Ukraine to promote “de-escalation” then #China will be emboldened to take advantage of a weak willed US. De-escalation &amp; diplomacy WON’T work if #Russia has no interest in either! #UkraineCrisis
