the actual facts   1) Ukraine is a neo fascist state ran by neo nazis and most certainly IS an aggressor  2) NATO is NOT a defensive alliance and is actually an imperialist front and most certainly DOES pose threats to Russia (just as it did to the USSR) #Russia #Ukraine #NATO

Break: #Sweden elite troops in #US military aircraft from #NATO base in #Hungary landed now in #Götland –Swe military chief asked #US to deploy more troops in East Europe –Swe DefMinister wants to send troops to #Ukraine  –Meanwhile #Russia's Lavrov praised today "Swe Neutrality" 
With @JoeBiden screwing up #Afganistan so badly it’s well known that if #Russia do attack #Ukraine then US will act. Currently it’s a stand off. Putin’s at a last stand. Issue is with UK as the UK Govt are awash with Russian money. Truth is the situation is very dark for us all. 
Today, Minister Joly spoke with her Dutch counterpart @WBHoekstra to welcome him to his new role. The ministers discussed their ongoing support to #Ukraine and #PS752 families, deterring arbitrary detention, and more. 
#Cybercrime attacks by #nationstates have been analogized to acts of #war - this is #crime as a precursor to war as #Russia prepares to invade #Ukraine in an attempt to destabilize and diminish command &amp; control systems of a sovereign nation.

Seeing the West and Russia cooperate on energy, climate, and cyber in the midst of a major European security crisis, with a real risk of armed conflict, is a sign that there are some functioning channels of dialogue. #NATO #Russia #Ukraine
