#USA and #Russia:  Biden warns Putin of ’severe sanctions’ in a telephone call.  #Ukraine is the epicenter of this geopolitical tussle between the two great powers.  1. #Putin feels squeezed. 2. #Biden views Russia bullying fellow democrat. 
The law "On the Fundamentals of National Resistance", adopted last summer, came into force on January 1 in #Ukraine. It regulates the development of territorial defense, organization of the resistance movement and preparation of Ukrainian citizens for national #resistance.
#France &amp; #Germany combined population at 150m+ exceed #Russia at 145m, so #Russia try to punch above its weight. Huge land mass. Trying to dominate #US &amp; #EU.  Leave #Ukraine alone. #Fix #Russian #kleptocracy. 🤷  #USSR failed, gone forever. 🤦‍♂️ 
The joke is on them, in 2022 #Ukraine will resist stronger than ever. #Russia the bully will not win #HappyNewYear #UkrainiansWillResist #UkrainebelongstoUkraine

Russia-US Conflict on Ukraine!#Ukraine #conflict #HumanRights #Afghan_lives_matter #worldwar3 
Happy New Year. May 2022 bring happiness, luck and love. May 2022 bring a reunited #Ukraine including Donbas and #Crimea. 
@tedcruz No surprise here. @JoeBiden has wrong about everything on foreign policy for 50 years, so of course he's mimicking #NevilleChamberlin and urging #Ukraine to appease #Putin. A real #POTUS would honor our agreement to defend Ukraine and urge NATO to do the same.
#Ukraine's 🇺🇦 future- will be decided &amp; determined by the Ukrainian people 🇺🇦. And- by no-one else. 
After tough talk between Presidents Joe #Biden and Vladimir #Putin over the Russian troop buildup on the #Ukraine border, both sides insist they are hopeful that a pathway to easing tensions could open during diplomatic talks set for January. 
@DefenseOne Any home defense forces are likely not as effective as intended, but, and that is the big one, it creates massive uncertainty about how an operation will unfold. Home defense forces are 75 % will, 25 % arms. Really hard to assess willpower. #ukraine #ukraina
#Everton have confirmed the signing of defender Vitaliy Mykolenko from #DynamoKiev for an undisclosed fee.  The #Ukraine international has agreed a four-and-a-half-year deal until the end of June 2026.
#Ukraine is preparing to defend itself from an aggressive #Russia in part by building a guerrilla force. After years of a de facto Russian invasion of the Donbas (easternmost Ukraine), they need it. 
#Russia #Ukraine    The Ukrainian army announces the death of one of its members in the clashes between pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country.
@StateDeptSpox @StateDept @tedcruz  @SecBlinken  American people have a right to know what specific measures #BidenAdministration has prepared to deter the #Russian invasion of #Ukraine. @JoeBiden's timid, half-pregnant, and dictator-appeasing approach is not working.
US government expects #Putin to make a decision if #Russia will launch an invasion of #Ukraine within the next 4 weeks. US military doesn't expect a #Russian offensive in March or April because of thaw. 
New York Post : #Biden warns #Putin he cannot invade #Ukraine 🇺🇦 or 'severe' sanctions' will occur.   via @GoogleNews
#News  In December 2021, 18 Ukrainian soldiers got either killed or wounded by Russia's ongoing aggression in eastern #Ukraine. 3 KIA 15 WIA #PutinAtWar 
#Ukraine is the one holding a gun at people's heads, #Donbas people's heads. 7 years of holding a gun to the region's head. 
@joe_warmington @LisbetBiden @raymcgovern @jonrappoport  *UNVERIFIED* reports circulating along with a video that Russian reserve troops have been called upon and are marching in the snow toward #Ukraine.
