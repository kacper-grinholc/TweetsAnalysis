World protector while losing OUR own democracy is NOT inspiring... US personnel only... #Ukraine #SundayThoughts #SundayMorning  #TWISI \‚óã~‚óã/
This shit lib admin of an Asheville FB political group just said that @KevinZeese was not a real journalist and that Obama‚Äôs State Department fomenting a coup in #Ukraine and putting in a Nazi sympathizer as president was ‚ÄúRussian disinformation.‚Äù 
@NATOpress #kazakhstan #USA #Biden #Russia #Ukraine #Putin Lol What you need to know first to understand what is going on and get out of the media discourse! People become so naive and infantilized as soon as the narrative about Western democracy comes forward ... 
Consider this: We have, diplomatic relations with #Putin, &amp; #Russia. We have none, with Donald #Trump. We negotiate Putin backing off say, #Ukraine, or human rights. NOTHING, regarding Trump's domestic terrorism.

Secretary of State #Antony Blinken: Breakthrough with Putin unlikely as #Ukraine tensions  - Jan 9 @ 1:45 PM ET 
You know what‚Äôs missing from this opinion piece?  The people of #Ukraine. All of them. 
In eastern #Ukraine, the #Russia|n proxy #DPR militias use this advert for recruiting militants.   Two items to note.   1) The photo was stolen from Norway‚Äôs armed forces @KonNorway  2) The advert promises facilitation in acquiring Russian passports. 
#Putin is invading #Kazakhstan under an agreement by the government in a step by step process to reconstruct the #SovietUnion- a deal has been made!  #Ukraine will be next, unless Ukraine is allowed to join #NATO.  I say Kazakhstan is lost, save Ukraine.

@KatyaYushchenko @Biz_Ukraine_Mag Amb. Yovanovitch‚Äôs book, ‚ÄúLessons From the Edge,‚Äù is scheduled for release on March 15th.  Perhaps the Biden Administration can get around to nominating a new US Ambassador to #Ukraine before the release of the book @HopkoHanna @SenWhitehouse @melindaharing @IKlympush
üòä For sure #Putin and #Russia are the biggest risks for #Ukraine according to #Andersaslund. Another Risk the retired angry grandpa from the #atlanticcouncil identified is going after his main oligarch donors üòä 
#Left out of high-level talks, #Ukraine tries other #DiplomaticChannels.
Send more weaponry to #Ukraine, then negotiate backing them off.
Putin is not just drama; it's power game-manipulation, control for resources-wants old Soviet-way. Death, destruction he doesn't care. World must care @POTUS @SecDef @SecArmy Put a Battalion on #Ukraine border. That very action will say it all! what's next- Belarus? Kazakhstan?
Haha, unbelievable, it‚Äôs more like once the Americans are in your house it‚Äôs very difficult to get them to leave. WW2 ended over 75 years ago and the US still has bases in Europe. People like @SecBlinken are totally out of touch with reality and full of sh*t. #Ukraine #Blinken 
#Ukraine better think twice, this is #Syria after VS came to 'help' the country. 
Lest we forget. #Russia has a long history of shameless prevarication, blatant threats, and bullying of its neighbors. #Putin #aggression #invasion #Ukraine #Georgia 
#Ukraine  Putin‚Äôs Politics are there to Threaten and Bully. Still They can start a war with Ukraine to test Western Imperialism and see if they can get away with it ‚Äì Dr ACactivism explains Hitmen-like Politics and Why they exist - Dr AC - Philosopher

Why #Biden has already failed in #Ukraine 
@nfergus  I am Ukrainian who lives in NY. Great analysis on #CNN regarding #Ukraine and #Putin.I agree:Putin's goal's to destabilize Ukraine so there never be democracy &amp;prosperity.Europeans need to step it and stop depending on Russia's gas!Until then,Putin will bully everyone!
#Russia #Ukraine tensions take a new turn and #G7 takes notice @ZelenskyyUa @KremlinRussia_E @mfa_russia @NATO @G7 
#Russia and the #UnitedStates hold talks in #Geneva from Sunday focused on tensions over #Ukraine but expected to touch on the slew of disputes between the former Cold War adversaries. 
The #USA has prepared a new package of #sanctions against #Russia that it says would go into effect within hours of an invasion of #Ukraine. #RussianAggression 
Surrender to #Russia over #Ukraine and #China over #Taiwan should not be confused with realism. Instead, realism should be made of far sterner stuff.
An insightful map by @nytimes that maps #Russian forces deployed on #Ukraine border, poised for action. With recent Russian ground forces also deployed in #Kazakhstan, will #Putin look to advance a strike time table? Thoughts?  
Whether you want to help fight #covid #Omnicron or end the #Filibuster or stop war in #Ukraine or get #BetterMasks or #BuildBackBetterAct moving  Understanding @RVAwonk ‚Äòs thread below is essential  And when in doubt, Block/report the trolls 
@FareedZakaria @nfergus @ianbremmer If the world leaders won't defend Ukraine , who gave up nuclear power, yes! It might spread ! #USDefendUkraine #StopPutin #UkraineWillResist #Ukraine
