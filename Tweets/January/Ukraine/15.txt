120k troops won’t get the Red Army to L’viv let alone Kiev. Ukraine is a huge country, with a professional western trained army and brand spanking new sophisticated weapons. U.K. and U.S special forces are already in Ukraine, Putin won’t risk humiliation #Russia #Ukraine #War

Dear #Ukraine - do you actually want Americans to "save" you from the Russians? You admire the work we've done in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria? Speak up now before you find yourselves being "rescued!"
I think very highly of @DeputySecState. But I am very disappointed at her accusation of ongoing Russian “aggression” against #Ukraine. Based on the situation as it currently exists, this is simply a misuse of a concept that has an actual meaning in international law. 
Will any members of European Parliament foreign committee will debate issue of ongoing prosecution of the leader of Opposition party in #Ukraine #Medvedchuk or just #Poroshenko? I thought all #HumanRight matters, not just selective individuals. 
Residents in #Ukraine should question their leadership why Ukraine was absent, not invited. The answer is simple: #NATO, #US, #Russia knows that Ukraine is just a geopolitical tool in that struggle. Ukraine doesn't decide anything in this context. #Zelensky will be briefed. 
Putin presents a profound threat to peace in Europe as 'drumbeat of war' sounds on Russia-Ukraine border. Putin is following in Adolf Hitler's footsteps in creating a reason to invade #Ukraine He has forgotten his ultimate end. #PutinResign #WWIII #OneV1  
#Russia is about to invade #Ukraine. Sleepy Joe is napping and the UN and #NATO  is useless. #Putin knows POTUS is weak and lacks support of the American people and the world.
@Amb_Ulyanov The west wants Putin to invade #Ukraine(they keep signaling no mil intervention by US) another Afghanistan? American people detest Cold War rhetoric of Biden Russia should replace #Lavrov with an FM who can integrate Russia to the western world&amp;make Russia great again

Much to the chagrin of the West, #Russia continues to display aggression on the #Ukraine front. Does this represent an opportunity for closer EU-Ukraine relations? Rahul Kamath explains. 
I re-twitted @DeanoBeano1  posts covering war in #Donbass region of #Ukraine. He covered pro rebels, separatists' news. I often expressed frustration that local inspectors who recorded bombings by Ukraine must have been confirmed by OSCE. He blocked me. I will block him too.
In the #AsiaPacific, #Japan may  be the next #Ukraine like staging ground. Why? Japan is being militarized to Western standards. Three nations come in mind: North Korea, China or Russia but Kuril Islands will be the focus. We already know the precursor to an #IndoPacific #NATO.

@StateDept @SecBlinken The US is on track to be the world's #1 exporter of LNG in 2022. Of course sanctions on NordStream II have nothing to do with US pressure on EU states to buy  its gas instead. The EU has declared those sanction illegal. They impact 120 EU companies and 20 EU nations.  #ukraine
In #Russia, @RT_Russian propagandist Krasovsky @krasovkin said on TV that “we will set Ukraine’s constitution on fire, together with Ukrainians, on Khreshchatyk [in central Kyiv], if #Ukraine becomes a @NATO member state”.  Typical #chauvinism.    
Biden’s handling of the Ukraine Russia crisis is very poor. He only set the very strong cost Russia will pay for an invasion. It is unfortunate but he should have offered to remove current Crimea sanctions or reduce troop numbers in Eastern Europe. #Russia #Ukraine

@scharap @FT A thoughtful "what if" piece by @scharap.  Is it plausible  that anything less than a hard "no" on #Ukraine membership in #NATO would satisfy #Russia?
@anneapplebaum @GerardAraud And so it played out, until after WWII France and Germany created the European Community of Coal and Steel (precursor to the EU) to integrate so closely with each other that no more zero-sum games, let alone war, would be possible. Try saying it this way for #Russia and #Ukraine.

1/2: Vladimir Putin presents a profound threat to ☮ peace in Europe as "drumbeat of war" sounds on 🇷🇺/🇺🇦 #Russia-#Ukraine border. Europe has a long and bloody history of wars, of borders brutally contested, of nations and empires carving destructive
And back to #Germany - #Ramstein from #Kiev #Ukraine, ready to pick up more contractors / arms and kit for tomorrow?  Seems likely or it would be back to Brize Norton direct    RRR1515 ZE707 
A tie goes to #Ukraine. @KremlinRussia #Putin can take and hold dirt, but he’ll risk his rule to do so. Younger Russians are especially opposed to the war. Half of 19-24yo support Alexei Navalny’s anti-government movement. And Biden just sent $200M in extra aid to Kyiv. @RunetsV
The talks about #Russia and #Ukraine should have ended in Paris. #FoodieDiplomacy 
single frame is 10 minutes long. Yet no one can provide a video of 100,000 Russian troops and vehicles along #Ukraine  border. Tonga Volcano Explodes, Detected by Himawari Satellite #shorts  via @YouTube
Thank you Minister Joly for your support for #Ukraine.  Safe travels! 
It’s amazing that the media are so consumed with the #Russia #Ukraine border when we have an open southern border that isn’t even on their radar.
The #US has accused #Russia of planning a 'false-flag operation' in eastern #Ukraine as part of its efforts to create a 'pretext for invasion', after government websites were hit by a 'massive cyber attack'  @FT #Diplomacy140 #FalseFlag #CyberAttack #Kyiv
#BobCarver @cybersecboardrm: EXCLUSIVE #Ukraine suspects group linked to #Belarus intelligence over #cyberattack 
Turmoil on the European gas prices continues with prices rebounding on heightened fears of #Russian military action against #Ukraine after the breakdown in security talks between #Moscow and #Washington.  @FT #Diplomacy140 
Can't help thinking that all of these clips of trains carrying military hardware across #Russia is part of a planned #psyops campaign intended to intimidate #Ukraine. Those posting them are working for #Putin.
Why are missiles called peacekeepers? #Ukraine
Clinical pharma researcher for a multinational as a day job - and a new #Ukraine territorial defence volunteer - explains her motivation: 
How many of those living in Donbass are now considered Russian citizens (by international or  Russian standards)? 50%? 70%  How many carry a Russian passport? Huge implications if Ukraine  sends forces into Eastern Ukraine. @StateDept @nytimes @ChristopherJM #ukraine #Russia

@S_Mikhailovich Those so called #analysts debating how many troops #Russia has near the border of #Ukraine &amp; how territorial #defence dig trenches don't have a clue about modern #warfare or #strategy. Now, #war is primarily conducted with long range, standoff, weapons &amp; this makes maneuver

@pierstech @Klllmanjaro @donaldgelman @nolanwpeterson @CNN And it's neither of interest nor is it true. #Ukraine. The Ukrainian language is quite old. Like in the old church slavic words have a base/root. And Kyiv becomes u/v Kievy when it stands in the locativ. This change is lost in the Russian language of today. So there the base...
Let's hope pressure on #Putin by #TrueLeaders  of #Democratic countries #Canada #USA Madea it too difficult for #Russia to invade #Ukraine #democracymatters # 
@FAIRmediawatch Hawkish Pundits Downplay Threat of War, #Ukraine's Nazi Ties -  "The fact that that Ukraine’s government and armed forces include a Nazi-sympathizing current surely would have an impact on US public opinion—if the public knew about it."
@BBCWorld Putin is trying to recreate the buffer zone that Stalin was paranoid about. #history #Ukraine #Russia
