Dear #Ukraine - do you actually want Americans to "save" you from the Russians? You admire the work we've done in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria? Speak up now before you find yourselves being "rescued!"
I think very highly of @DeputySecState. But I am very disappointed at her accusation of ongoing Russian ‚Äúaggression‚Äù against #Ukraine. Based on the situation as it currently exists, this is simply a misuse of a concept that has an actual meaning in international law. 
Will any members of European Parliament foreign committee will debate issue of ongoing prosecution of the leader of Opposition party in #Ukraine #Medvedchuk or just #Poroshenko? I thought all #HumanRight matters, not just selective individuals. 
Residents in #Ukraine should question their leadership why Ukraine was absent, not invited. The answer is simple: #NATO, #US, #Russia knows that Ukraine is just a geopolitical tool in that struggle. Ukraine doesn't decide anything in this context. #Zelensky will be briefed. 
Putin presents a profound threat to peace in Europe as 'drumbeat of war' sounds on Russia-Ukraine border. Putin is following in Adolf Hitler's footsteps in creating a reason to invade #Ukraine He has forgotten his ultimate end. #PutinResign #WWIII #OneV1  
#Russia is about to invade #Ukraine. Sleepy Joe is napping and the UN and #NATO  is useless. #Putin knows POTUS is weak and lacks support of the American people and the world.

Much to the chagrin of the West, #Russia continues to display aggression on the #Ukraine front. Does this represent an opportunity for closer EU-Ukraine relations? Rahul Kamath explains. 
I re-twitted @DeanoBeano1  posts covering war in #Donbass region of #Ukraine. He covered pro rebels, separatists' news. I often expressed frustration that local inspectors who recorded bombings by Ukraine must have been confirmed by OSCE. He blocked me. I will block him too.
In the #AsiaPacific, #Japan may  be the next #Ukraine like staging ground. Why? Japan is being militarized to Western standards. Three nations come in mind: North Korea, China or Russia but Kuril Islands will be the focus. We already know the precursor to an #IndoPacific #NATO.

@nolanwpeterson posobiec+his putin-issued "wife" will be in prison soon, so you won't have to deal with his bullsh*t tweets, Nolan. THANK YOU for your service &amp; your vital reporting from the frontlines of #ENEMYruSSia's war on #Ukraine. No other Western reporter is brave enough to go.üá∫üá∏üá∫üá¶‚úå
Former president of #ukraine coming back Monday in #lviv  .#poroshenko is facing treason charges&amp;needs to show he is still in #politics.Govt threatens to arrest him when he comes back but it will be difficult to do it if many supporters turn to welcome him for a #pr opportunity.
#Russia is attempting to forcefully drag #Ukraine into the Darkness of Authoritarianism at the moment at the same time China also planning to drag Taiwan by force into the Darkness. Afghanistan was forced into the Darkness last year #RussiaInvadedUkraine
#US official: ‚Äú#Russia has already prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false-flag operation in eastern #Ukraine.¬†The operatives are trained in urban warfare &amp; in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against own Russia‚Äôs proxy-forces‚Äù @margbrennan #falseflag 
We complained in no uncertain terms about the "military contractors" being shipped into #UKRAINE at our taxpayer's expense and the chemicals too @ablinken @cabinetofficeuk and @vonderleyen   not going to get this #falseflag-a-going any more than the coup attempt in #Kazakhistan 
@nolanwpeterson @spawnofKahn You know that #posobiec has a honeypot handler, sponsored by mass-murderer #putin to spread #Ukraine-hate, right? Why hasn't his "wife," i.e. kremlin asset, been deported like #butina??? cc: @DHSgov
Random thought. Wonder how many Soviet now CEE "dissident's" died or are still alive. In great standing in the West. Has trustworthy Western friends  All this time funneling intel back to the Russian's  Not recommending a witch hunt.  You'd be foolish not to think it. #Ukraine
This time ‚ÄúI think the gloves should come off.‚ÄùBy that I mean we must provide the offensive lethal assistance necessary for #Ukraine to repel #Russia from its territory. The #BudapestMemoradum requires this of the nuke powers(Fr &amp;China in separate docs).

#ukraine don't underestimate the potential disunity within Europe--driven by these disparate energy expenditures--if Europe is asked to pressure Russia and Moscow turns off the spigot 
1/2: Vladimir Putin presents a profound threat to ‚òÆ peace in Europe as "drumbeat of war" sounds on üá∑üá∫/üá∫üá¶ #Russia-#Ukraine border. Europe has a long and bloody history of wars, of borders brutally contested, of nations and empires carving destructive
And back to #Germany - #Ramstein from #Kiev #Ukraine, ready to pick up more contractors / arms and kit for tomorrow?  Seems likely or it would be back to Brize Norton direct    RRR1515 ZE707 
A tie goes to #Ukraine. @KremlinRussia #Putin can take and hold dirt, but he‚Äôll risk his rule to do so. Younger Russians are especially opposed to the war. Half of 19-24yo support Alexei Navalny‚Äôs anti-government movement. And Biden just sent $200M in extra aid to Kyiv. @RunetsV
The talks about #Russia and #Ukraine should have ended in Paris. #FoodieDiplomacy 
single frame is 10 minutes long. Yet no one can provide a video of 100,000 Russian troops and vehicles along #Ukraine  border. Tonga Volcano Explodes, Detected by Himawari Satellite #shorts  via @YouTube
Thank you Minister Joly for your support for #Ukraine.  Safe travels! 
It‚Äôs amazing that the media are so consumed with the #Russia #Ukraine border when we have an open southern border that isn‚Äôt even on their radar.
The #US has accused #Russia of planning a 'false-flag operation' in eastern #Ukraine as part of its efforts to create a 'pretext for invasion', after government websites were hit by a 'massive cyber attack'  @FT #Diplomacy140 #FalseFlag #CyberAttack #Kyiv
#BobCarver @cybersecboardrm: EXCLUSIVE #Ukraine suspects group linked to #Belarus intelligence over¬†#cyberattack 
Turmoil on the European gas prices continues with prices rebounding on heightened fears of #Russian military action against #Ukraine after the breakdown in security talks between #Moscow and #Washington.  @FT #Diplomacy140 
Can't help thinking that all of these clips of trains carrying military hardware across #Russia is part of a planned #psyops campaign intended to intimidate #Ukraine. Those posting them are working for #Putin.
Why are missiles called peacekeepers? #Ukraine
Clinical pharma researcher for a multinational as a day job - and a new #Ukraine territorial defence volunteer - explains her motivation: 
How many of those living in Donbass are now considered Russian citizens (by international or  Russian standards)? 50%? 70%  How many carry a Russian passport? Huge implications if Ukraine  sends forces into Eastern Ukraine. @StateDept @nytimes @ChristopherJM #ukraine #Russia

@pierstech @Klllmanjaro @donaldgelman @nolanwpeterson @CNN And it's neither of interest nor is it true. #Ukraine. The Ukrainian language is quite old. Like in the old church slavic words have a base/root. And Kyiv becomes u/v Kievy when it stands in the locativ. This change is lost in the Russian language of today. So there the base...
