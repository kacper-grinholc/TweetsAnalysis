@NatashaBertrand What costs? Just like @BarackObama's red line in the sand: the use of poison gas by #BacharElAssad against its own people?ü§î @fhollande still mad ab. American inaction then. Look at the state of Syria now, the dead &amp; refugees! So what costs will #Putin pay if he invades #Ukraine?
Here's the original @POTUS quote on #Ukraine: "I think what you're going to see is that Russia will be held accountable if it invades.....And it depends on what it does. It's one thing if it's a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not to do" 
#Canada, echoing U.S., says it fears armed conflict could erupt in #Ukraine. ‚û°Ô∏è Sell them some of Canada's well-used useless arms.
#Biden predicts #Russia 'will move in' to #Ukraine, but says 'minor incursion' may prompt discussion over consequences. ‚û°Ô∏è Depends on what you call a minor border adjustment - stopping at the Dneiper or the Dneister?

NEW: WH clean-up on Biden's #Ukraine comments, saying Russian action short of troops invading still "will be met w/a decisive, reciprocal, and united response."  But Biden cast doubt on that‚Äîsaying x2 NATO divided on responding to less than invasion  More:  
"And it depends on what it does. It‚Äôs one thing if it‚Äôs a minor incursion and we end up having to fight about what to do and not do," Biden added.  So this is acceptable to the U.S. government? Putin can take #Ukraine provided he doesn‚Äôt do it all at once? 
@SecBlinken @StateDept @DepSecStateMR After all that State Dep has done to deter the #Russian dictator, why the hell is @JoeBiden inviting #Russia to invade #Ukraine?  #JoeBiden is a liability to #America. Pure and simple.  Can he at least not talk about the foreign policy? Let @ABlinken handle the foreign policy
@BukoskieKyle @RNCResearch So you think letting russia take #Ukraine is preventing war? It would actually embolden putin to take more. Sometimes a line has to be drawn. Yes US didn‚Äôt WANT to enter WWII, but at some point it was inevitable to do the right thing.
US President Joe Biden on Wednesday predicted Russia "will move in" to #Ukraine, citing existential concerns by the country's president, Vladimir Putin, even as he warned of significant economic consequences should such an incursion occur.

Does #JoeBiden intend to build a human-sheild of #US #mercenaries in #Ukraine in case of his #fictitious #war starts? He probably wants his son to be #Ukrainian #president asap which he only can achieve by #fearmongering.
What did happen today in #Ukraine is a fist fight between so called religious #Ukrainians in #Kyiv aka #Kiev during #Epiphany ritual. It was happening while a priest was conducting a public prayer. Maybe that was a provocation for Russian invasion?  Just joking. 
The French have always wanted it there way, with #russia and w/out the Americans. DeGaulle tradition. But the French and Germans already had their chance on many occasions, staring from russia occupying territories in #Moldova #Georgia and #Ukraine, via #Minsk #Normandie formats

@JohnAndris @nikola_mikovic 2&gt;&gt; But personally I think a Minor Incursion will at least include #Kharkov and at least some areas North of Crimea.  Odessa? To far to the West? But Zaporizhzhia? Cherson? Who knows?  #Crimea #Ukraine #MinorIncursion
@SecBlinken #Russia is not only threatening #Ukraine, but also many of its neighboring countries like the Baltic countries and Sweden. So this Russian aggression matters to all countries of the free world.
@mchancecnn @POTUS As in all the years of the war, Ukraine can count on its population! #Ukraine
Did Biden really just "invite" Putin to invade the Ukraine on a "small scale"???  This Presser may go down in infamy.  What a screw up.  #Ukraine #PutinatWar #Putin #BidenWorstPresidentEver #BidenIsAFailure #bidenpressconference #BidenIsALaughingstock #BidenPresser
@ggreenwald Intriguing take on #Ukraine &amp; #Russia
Actually I think the uber-sanctions will be a disaster for the US and #Russia will forge closer economic ties with #China. #Ukraine is the most unstable nation in Europe and its wretched regime is infested with corruption, not to mention neo-Nazis. 
Russia will be held accountable if it invades Ukraine, says Biden  #JoeBiden #Ukraine #RussiaInvadedUkraine #VladimirPutin

Pro tip @POTUS  It‚Äôs a damn sight easier to #Protect #Ukraine from the #RussianInvasion than it will be too #RESCUE them‚Ä¶
Diverging statements from #Biden and #Zelensky today on likely developments in #Russia - #Ukraine conflict. 
@JohnAndris @nikola_mikovic Putin can use the Western #Kosovo logic: the whole province/oblast. So #DNR/#LNR can claim they only liberate the whole of the #Donetsk and #Luhansk oblasts. Problem for #Putin: this means no land bridge to #Crimea.   #MinorIncursion #UKRAINE
I think I just heard Biden give Putin greenlight on Russian invasion of Ukraine... #JoeBiden #bidenpressconference  #Ukraine
Biden just threw Ukraine under the bus.   #Ukraine 
Today @POTUS threw #Ukraine under the bus and gave #Putin the green light to invade! It is just unbelievable!  He has demonstrated just how weak he is.
.@POTUS @JoeBiden downplaying the Russian invasion to #Ukraine is a massive #FuckUp cc @SecBlinken
As long as it‚Äôs not all the territory of #Ukraine it‚Äôs okay ? What‚Äôs what you mean ?   Disaster. 
@CNN @jaketapper is being brutally honest  about @POTUS ‚Äòs responses relating to #Ukraine
Invade #ukraine once more fool you. Invade ukraine twice...man, like...so many embargos n shit...
@SenatorDurbin You're on the #Ukraine caucus. What dud Biden mean about a minor Russian incursion?
#Biden just greenlit #Russia to invade #Ukraine on National tv during that abomination of a press conference‚Ä¶ unreal
