The enemies of the regime are inside, not outside. It is striking &amp; alarming how well this reads if you replace '#Russia' with '#China', '#Putin' with '#Xi', '#Ukraine' with '#Taiwan': Putin's  threats disguise a weakening position @VJMallet #Diplomacy140 
As usual, the rogue regime in the border lands continue to act like rogue...the clown continues to act like one.  #Ukraine #EU #EnergyCrisis Ukraine warns Europe it may have to siphon off Russian gas 
Really bizarre aspect is that post-#Brexit #Britain has outsourced its defence policy deploying troops to the #BalticStates who as members of the #EU have no more say in #US-#Russia talks than #Ukraine. #SpecialRelationship used to involve the courtesy of consultation - no more. 
@olgatokariuk @Biz_Ukraine_Mag Meaning whatever guarantee is made they will break it anyway.  Best thing is to read the room. Between the lines, what have you.  They are going to attack. That's the thing to know.   They are distracting everyone with these "issues"  #Ukraine needs more weapons and a better plan
Dialogue is a must but so is deterrence: any further aggression against #Ukraine will have massive consequences for #Russia. Our purpose is to get Russia to de-escalate tensions &amp; fully implement #Minsk agreements. The #EU &amp; its partners continue to stand by 🇺🇦 Read full blog 👇 
Goodnight #Ukraine. Today while US &amp; Russia held their #GenevaTalks in warm offices, 2 #Ukrainian soldiers died on a cold frontline. Their faces will soon join the thousands already on a wall in #Kyiv.   And what will the world do to stop Russia killing more Ukrainians?  FUCK ALL

@usnigg You are correct #USA military &amp; intelligence has been relocated to target #Ukraine, #Kazakhstan &amp; #Taiwan. Yesterday they targeted #Russia today is #China! Tomorrow is #Iran then in rotation. It never stops!

Negotiate with the organ-grinder #US not with the monkey #Ukraine     #Russia #US #GenevaTalks 
Asked by @baysontheroad if she believes #Russian Deputy FM that #Moscow has no plans to invade #Ukraine, @USAmbUN said she wishes it is true, "But everything we have seen so far indicate that they are making motions in that direction." (1/2)
#Putin claims to #Biden in #Geneva that he has no intention of invading #Ukraine. So why the 100,000 troops on the border? He struts his aggression like a school boy playground bully. So sad for so rightly proud  #Russia to have such a bully choirboy as it's leader

#Russia “told the #UnitedStates at tense talks Monday that it had no plans to invade #Ukraine as the two sides agreed to more efforts to keep tensions from turning into a full-blown confrontation.  Russian and U.S. negotiators both offered to keep talking”

6. #Ukraine, that seems big on #US/West's agenda was brushed off early on by Ryabkov saying “There’re no intentions to invade Ukraine. #Russia doesn’t have these intentions &amp; simply cannot have them”.
5. Ryabkov “#Russia needs “ironclad guarantees” that #Ukraine and #Georgia will never become members of @NATO.. by refusing to discuss our demands on NATO’s non-enlargement #US seriously underestimate the seriousness of the situation”
#Ukraine #Russia told the #UnitedStates at tense talks in #Geneva that it had no plans to invade Ukraine, as the two sides agreed to more efforts to keep tensions from turning into a full-blown confrontation. #geopoliticalrisk 
4.#Russia also made it clear that in the coming Madrid summit it wants NATO to enshrine its “NO” to #Ukraine &amp; #Georgia’s aspirations to join the alliance. This seems the most undoable part of the deal but also the one Russia truly cares about.
Former Ambassador warns Russia is overreaching in #Ukraine - Jan 10 @ 3:17 PM ET

@TheRickWilson @ProjectLincoln Still haven't seen #MassiveEvidence...If #They had it..#FoxNews would have published it.  Lists all problem #TFG created and Blames #Democrats for them.

#Ukraine’s Domestic #intelligence service on Monday detained a Russian military intelligence agent who was planning attacks on the country's largest #BlackSea port of #Odessa. He was detained while trying to recruit someone to carry out attacks, it added. 
"Our position on this has not changed," said @StateDeptSpox when ashed what is the U.S. position now on whether #Ukraine should be a member of @NATO. "NATO has an open door policy. Any country that aspires to join NATO should be able to do so," he added. @VOANews

I found this interesting and informative. @LawDavF trying to analyze the Russian plans in #Ukraine .  Provided, of course, that there is a plan.
