“The #US and #Germany's top diplomats issued a joint warning to #Russia ahead of high-level security talks in #Europe next week, pledging "massive" economic consequences if Vladimir #Putin proceeds with an invasion of #Ukraine.”

The #US and #Germany’s top diplomats reiterate that they will impose consequences on Russia for an invasion of #Ukraine, with German FM Annalena Baerbock stressing the need for a diplomatic solution to heightened tensions between Moscow and the West. 
"Might the turmoil in #Kazakhstan be a pretext for Russian military action? And, if so, then where?"  Could Putin move on both Kazakhstan &amp; #Ukraine? He has the military might. The chutzpah may be another matter. My latest for @NewYorkSun.

@EZuroff If you saw original tweet of #srael's embassy in #Ukraine, you would find more than 1,000 comments. Sadly, majority of the comments written by Ukrainians were pure #hate targeting the Jews, the State of #Israel for condemning march and antisemitic banner on January 1st.
On 31 December 2021, I discussed world events with two friends after dinner. I said #Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 would be the first flash point of 2022 not #Ukraine. I can smell covert operations with remote viewing from a great distance. Today it came to pass, tomorrow will bring the CTSO.

He did. That's the problem. #Ablyazov has provoked #Russia by giving #Putin the argument that the #Kazakhprotests are organised from #Ukraine as a #NATO strategem against his regime. Will #Putin calm down if #Borat is silenced or will he feel freer to move on versus #Ukraine?

@SheckelsteinM @MatthewMcCrac18 @AJEnglish The media seems to believe that as we speak #Russia is moving troops to #Kazakhstan.   That must be an invasion, surely?  One must assume that they are being taken from the troops poised to invade #Ukraine.
Was it a smart move for #MukhtarAblyazov to send so many tweets from a +38 #Ukraine #Telegram address claiming to lead the uprising? Not good #Kharma for the #Kazakh protestors if you wanted to avoid #Russian intervention, but poor #Borat has always been a joke to the #West.

What's happening in #Kazakhstan is hugely significant. Russia can't easily invade 2 exSoviet states at the same time. #Ukraine may reap the benefits of the popular revolution in Central Asia. Kazaks will pay the price. Putin has a decision to make. Dictatorship isn't always easy.

#BREAKING | #US's #Blinken says #Germany should stop #Nord2 pipeline if #Russia attacks #Ukraine. "Some may see #NordStream2 as leverage that Russia can use against #Europe In fact, it’s leverage for Europe to use against Russia.”  #USA #EuropeanUnion #Putin #Biden #OlafScholz 
Even more likely now. #Kazakhstan  Also, I don't put it past Putin to pull out of the upcoming diplomatic talks on #Ukraine. Something to watch. 
The Russian population of Ukraine is concentrated in the eastern part of the country, as well as in the Crimean Peninsula (which was annexed by Russia in 2014). #DEI #Russia #Ukraine
The #CSTO (read #Russia) getting busy in #Kazakhstan means some relief for #Ukraine. 
@redfishstream Pure propaganda. They initially aligned with Germany to fight off RUSSIA, not to ethnically cleanse anyone. Bandera was actually jailed by the Nazis after he didn't want to cooperate with them any longer after they broke their promise to support #Ukraine 's independence.
#BREAKING Blinken says Germany should stop pipeline if Russia attacks Ukraine  #BreakingNews #Usa #Ukraine #Russia
Hey wouldn't it be funny if while everyone was staring at #Ukraine Putin's real move was to annex Kazakhstan and its enormous resource pool with its proximity to China?  Sure it can be "independent" just with an all Russian chosen and militarily supported government. 
1. I won't be surprised if some members do support this. Putin is busy in #Ukraine, but #Kazakhstan is of major importance for 🇷🇺. 2. I will never forgive the Arm Government if it moves a finger for the same Kazakh govt, which gave 0 effs when #Armenia needed their support. 
@EndGameWW3 Maybe #Putin just says FK It and cancels the #NATO meeting and goes balls deep in #Ukraine #Russia

@EndGameWW3 #Putin can't really help all the troops that where on the #Kazakistan border where moved about 6 months ago to the #Ukraine and #Belarus borders
@DH_1717 Which coup are you referring to? The one where the PEOPLE demonstrated against a corrupt puppet president? The one where Yanukovych ran to russia after ordering troops on peaceful protesters? The one that had legitimate elections held after he fled on his own? #Ukraine
As Tensions are high on #Ukraine's border with #Russia. Is the war imminent?   
#Kazakhstan's President just asked #Russia for a "friendly" #Invasion. since Putin already has his troops saddled up to invade #Ukraine, I'm sure he'll be happy to oblige. #SaveDemocracyNow #KrauseCares #IaPolitics

@HappinessPatrol Don't expect to see invasion of #Ukraine with this going on.#putin may be too busy for a lot of talks with US
#Romania #Russia #Ukraine #gas #dependence Russia resumes gas supply to Romania which is increasingly dependent on imports  via @Universul.net
@anessen101 @Maria45ma Noone is demanding war! The US and the EU is demanding that russia de-escalate and remove their troops from the border of #Ukraine. The only ones violating any agreements is russia who is a signatory of the Budapest Referendum ensuring the protection of Ukraine's sovereignty.
"Geopolitical landscape is changing quickly; conflict  border #Ukraine is getting worse.    EU is most reliable partner of Ukraine, providing political, financial &amp; economic support.  We are no longer in Yalta times; any discussion on European security must include EU and UA."

"Top #EU diplomat offers full support to #Ukraine on visit to conflict frontline" 
@baunov Any chance for Maidan redux in #Kazakhstan to create another #Ukraine?  Can Mukhtar Ablyazov who lives in France be staged for that purpose?  Seeing some other trails here... US embassy, Radio  Free Europe, won't wonder CIA / NED get involved 👇👇👇
@eHETEROPHOBIA @Mortis_Banned @Tankgorl Upon the breakup of the Soviet Union, Crimeans voted for autonomy - but under #Ukraine. It was in their Constitution. The referendum held after the annexation was held under gunfire and illegitimate.
My guess is now #Putin has more to worry about than #Ukraine. The #Kazakhstan eruption was quick &amp; obviously caught #Kremlin off guard. Dictatorships work until suddenly, they don't. Was it all home front, or did @JoeBiden stir the pot to take heat off? Dunno. #SaveDemocracyNow 
"With regard to the pipeline itself, as I said, it's not operational and from our perspective, it's very hard to see gas flowing through that pipeline...if #Russia renews its aggression on #Ukraine," said @SecBlinken  again during a presser w/ @ABaerbock. @VOANews 
#Psaki on Russian demands: "We're not responding to them point by point(...)bc in our experience, you don't make actual progress by negotiating in public. also because many of the proposals don't merit such responses. But Russia is very familiar with our positions." #Ukraine #F24
@RALee85 #Ukraine right now and the #US lol 
#Putin got out played in this game of chess. #Russia just got set up. #NATO #Ukraine #Kazakistan. Now What ? Nobody rides for free ASS, CASH or GAS.  
I’m making the case for supporting #Ukraine in this debate tonight. 8 PM PST / 11 PM PST. Let’s go! 
🔴 The U.S.  and #Germany say that #Russia’s military buildup near #Ukraine’s border poses an “immediate and urgent challenge” to #European security.  Secretary of State Antony #Blinken and his German counterpart presented an unified front on #Russia after meeting
"US national security advisor discusses #Ukraine with Finnish, other #Nordic officials" - #Finland  
BREAKING: #Germany FM Baerbock says “effective measures” will be taken on Nordstream 2 if #Russia continues aggression vs #Ukraine.   But adds need for Ukraine to move for green energy, be less dependent on fossil fuel.
That's 6 years into #Ukraine holding a gun at the head of #Donbass people to sabotage Minsk (this is no endorsement of Minsk, it's a bad peace agreement, but it's the one Ukraine signed). 
#US @SecBlinken says no progress with #Russia as long as "gun at #Ukraine's head" 
Blinken says no progress with #Russia so long as 'gun at #Ukraine's head' - AFP
🔴 #Blinken stresses that no progress will be made with #Russia as long as "weapons are directed at the head of #Ukraine."
