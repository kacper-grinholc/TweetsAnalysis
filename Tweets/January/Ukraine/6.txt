#Putin says #Russia is threatened. It is not. The real threat is Mr Putin. When he issues his demands down the barrel of a gun, it should stiffen the resolve both of the West and of resilient #Ukraine to deter and resist. 
The world is crazy. #Pray 4 #Kazachstan, the #MiddleEast, #Ukraine, #Europe, #Turkey, #CentralAmerica, #SouthAmerica, #Africa &amp; wherever else there’s turmoil. Your #Crypto investments don’t happen in a vacuum. The #economy is #global. Root 4 global stability, make global #money.
UNHRC is deeply concerned, we supposed. As well as the whole diplomatic world was concerned when #Russia annexed Crimea &amp; waged #war in #Donbass. Even now ppl say "#Ukraine conflict" or crisis, not "Russia - Ukraine war". Soon will see what expression will be use to #Kazakhstan 
It is usually a bad sign if talks start with one side brandishing a gun. But Russia’s aggression towards Ukraine has given the West an opportunity to enhance European security. Our cover this week  #Putin #Donbas #Ukraine #Russia

New: #Putin can’t afford crises in both #Kazakhstan and #Ukraine  by me @PostOpinions
@KremlinRussia_E When nations have a temper tantrum and threaten war unless they get their way, the threat of war should be taken seriously. But not their insipid demands.  Grow up, #putin. #Ukraine
@MavkaSlavka @TheSun @CNN @CNN are fully compliant with the #Moscow false narrative. If the #Kremlin says it in a media release CNN will dutifully project that false narrative. The worst end of this sorry spectrum is @TuckerCarlson of @FoxNews who openly cheers the fascist #Russian invaders of #Ukraine.
Strategic nuclear weapons are used primarily as part of a doctrine of deterrence by threatening large targets, such as [#Kyiv].  Tactical nuclear weapons are for use in limited military maneuvers, such as destroying [#Ukraine’s] military, communications, or infrastructure targets
The Ukrainian capital Kyiv... #Ukraine .. good night... Merry Christmas 
This action by #Russia is nothing more then a trial run for what they plan to do in the #Ukraine. They will destabilize the government, create a coup de tat, causing civil unrest and then move in…”invited” by the military under the disguise of restore ing order. 
@htTweets NATO on Russia´s doorstep inching into #Ukraine is bringing the world close to world war. Russia will not start the war. Russia will end the war...

Disagree. Putin is strengthening Russian interests by consolidating them.  Putin &amp; Lukashenko are more like Thelma and Louise Kamikaze style with nothing to lose.   With every crackdown &amp; occupation by Russia NATO seems less mobile and more rigid in expansion #Ukraine #Kazakhstan

@emplexx yeah #Ukraine
Following next week's #US-#Russia, #NATO-Russia &amp; OSCE meetings, watch how Moscow acts. That will go long way to answering question of whether Kremlin wants serious discussion on European security or simply seeks to escalate conflict against #Ukraine. 
Putin’s saber-rattling against Ukraine could be the product of weakness, not strength. And the Kazakhs have reminded the world just how weak Putin’s grip may well be. The people of #Kazakhstan, #Belarus, #Ukraine &amp; #Georgia have already shown the limits of Putin’s Soviet dreams.

Hasn't #Russia shown repeatedly that - unlike the #Pentagon's obsession with massive superiority - small but determined deployments can be decisive. #Syria2015 for instance. Therefore #West thinking #Putin is distracted from #Ukraine are missing the point.

🤩 that’s great news for #Ukraine 😊 A new church of witnesses Bob Marley has opened in #Kharkov 
For all Eastern Rite Ukainian Catholics &amp; Ukrainian Orthodox Christians celebrating Christmas Eve tonight, their thoughts are with the brave Ukrainian soldiers defending their land against Putin's fascist war machine. @Nato's freedom starts in #Ukraine.  #PunishPutin #MerryXmas 
Coordinator of the opposition movement Democratic Choice of #Kazakhtan, Zamanbek #Tleuliyev was attacked by unknown people at home in #Kiev, #Ukraine. Men claim they work for the Security Service of Ukraine (СБУ), yet didn’t show any papers, hit him in the face &amp; broke his teeth 
Reports that #Ukraine court has frozen assets of former pres Poroshenko inc his TV channels. If true you have to question the motives of pres Zelenskij/ his  advisers. With war probably immeninent this is certain to divide the country not unite it

Is #Russia Trying To Turn The #Balkans Into The Next #Ukraine? #Bosnia (by @SteveB7SFG)  
➡️"The leaders of the military intelligence of Ukraine and the Republic of Turkey agreed to deepen cooperation."  #turkeynews #Intelligence #Ukraine  
.@SpiegelPeter's overarching points here are important - #Putin's likely to have repeated fires breaking out on #Russia's borders.  And the current crisis in #Kazakhstan isn't exactly strengthening his hand vs #Ukraine:   #KazakhstanProtests #geopolitics
#Russia News Review: How #Kazakhstan could shift #Putin's calculus on #Ukraine | The Powder Keg Of Post-Soviet Central Asia | Weapons and Wars   protesters in Kazakhstan included militants in armed gangs operating in "Middle East, primarily in Afghanistan."
„The U.S. and the West need to prepare for choppy waters and a rocky ride ahead.“ I couldn‘t agree more! #Russia #Ukraine 
@ForeignPolicy @PieterSlootdorp "For years, Finland and Sweden have worried about how Russia might react to their military decisions"  It's rapidly becoming scary...  #Ukraine #Finland #Kazachstan #Sweden #EU #NATO #Macron #Draghi #energy_prices #COVID19 ; what'll be next?
#Ukraine’s geographical proximity with both the #EU and #Russia enables it to extend its cooperation across both sides, especially owing to deep historical and cultural ties with Russia, points out Rahul Kamath. 
🇺🇦Ukraine: High Representative @JosepBorrellF visited #Ukraine to reconfirm EU’s support against external threats 
May the beauty of nature contribute to a peaceful feeling. May we have peace all over the world, hunger be ended and care for nature. May we see soon: " A World in Which All Children Can Play." 🕊️♥️🙏🌍🌳  #Gaza #Kazakshtan #Ukraine #Yemen #Peace #Endhunger #ForNature. 
I still cannot understand why people are so stupid and do think Putin wants peace. This is so idiotic and danger. Every time when western politicians speak about peace then nothing but a view of Russian tanks arriving in Europe comes to my mind. #1938Putin #Ukraine #Kazakshtan 
Why @POTUS⁩ Will End Up Giving #Putin What He Wants In #Ukraine; #StopRussianAggression #RussiaInvadedUkraine #StopNordStream2 #UkraineInNATO #uSAarmUkraine #Ukraine #NATO #muscovy  
I would say it is even more recognizable in the context of #Maidan illegal coup in #Ukraine in 2014 causing enourmous damage to this country up to today. This coup has also become kind of vaccine against #ColorRevolutions for post-Soviet republics #Kazakhstan 
@NotDragonTomas @PoliticalGeeker @nexta_tv  What happened in the end? I will tell you: #NATO. Soon in #Ukraine. 😂
@ABaerbock  @GermanyDiplo  @OlafScholz  Why does #germany collaborate with mass-murderer #putin? Stop defending #ENEMYruSSia and start helping #Ukraine.
@npr PAY ATTENTION: Those are NOT "#russian peacekeepers" being sent to #Kazakhstan. They're ruthless killers, like the ones mass-murderer #putin sent to #Ukraine to try to stomp out democracy! Stop lying to yr listeners!🤬

Kremlin’s unwillingness to recognize #Ukraine as a sovereign state has resulted in major strategic failure for #Russia, says Steven Pifer  @Stanford @FSIStanford
2 TV news channels owned by Poroshenko are arrested in #Ukraine. By sanctioning or arresting in less then 1 year 7 TV news channels, which are controlled by leaders of 2 main opposition parties, #Zelensky  surpasses Poroshenko in illegal power grab &amp; assault on opposition #media 
You cannot comprehend how weaker #Russia is these days. Their influence is dwindling day by day and soon they will end up like a whale in a jar. #khazakstan #Ukraine
I'm not one to speculate much but there are concerning parallels to 2014 #Crimea in #Kazakhstan. Whether it leads to similar events is unknown but it could, and we should keep an eye out for such possibilities. #KazakhstanProtests #CentralAsia #Russia #Ukraine #CSTO
I won't be surprised to learn that the sudden outbreak of violent protests in #Kazakhstan has been triggered by Western #Intel Services (#Mi6-@CIA-#French-#Turks) with a view to distracting #Russia from #Ukraine &amp; #Donbass  Where did "#Protesters" get Lethal Weaponry &amp; Training?
"The protracted suspension or cancellation of elections or voting in certain territories [in Donetsk &amp; Luhansk in #Ukraine] would risk unduly infringing the right to vote and be elected," state @osce_odihr &amp; @VeniceComm in their joint opinion  
My wish for 2022? May this be a year of unremitting dullness. Unfortunately, the trouble makers have other ideas.  #Russia #Putin #Ukraine #China #SouthChinaSea  #Taiwan  #Iran #NorthKorea
1/2 Hours after I praised German journalists from @telegraphberlin for highliting the issue of 13-year old Lugansk child-writer Faina Savenkova’s personal data displayed at #Mirotvorets nationalist site, this site labelled Veronika Naidenova as “Enemy of #Ukraine”

US, Germany say Russia poses 'urgent' challenge to stability | AP News “ ‘Both #Germany and the #UnitedStates see #Russia actions toward #Ukraine as an immediate and urgent challenge to peace and stability in Europe,” ⁦@SecBlinken⁩ said.” ⁦@AP⁩ 
My interview with Stanford News on #Russia-#Ukraine crisis.  Moscow seeks to frame this as crisis between Russia and #NATO, but Kremlin's main concern is Ukraine. Russia, however, is pushing Ukraine away and toward West. 
45th Brigade subordinated to both VDV (airborne) and GRU.  With its Spetnaz recruitment and training, elements were identified by SBU fighting in #Ukraine 2014-15 operating in Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.  These are not ‘peacekeepers’ by training or operational history.
