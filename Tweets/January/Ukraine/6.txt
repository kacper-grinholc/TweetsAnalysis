#Putin says #Russia is threatened. It is not. The real threat is Mr Putin. When he issues his demands down the barrel of a gun, it should stiffen the resolve both of the West and of resilient #Ukraine to deter and resist.

UNHRC is deeply concerned, we supposed. As well as the whole diplomatic world was concerned when #Russia annexed Crimea &amp; waged #war in #Donbass. Even now ppl say "#Ukraine conflict" or crisis, not "Russia - Ukraine war". Soon will see what expression will be use to #Kazakhstan 
It is usually a bad sign if talks start with one side brandishing a gun. But Russia‚Äôs aggression towards Ukraine has given the West an opportunity to enhance European security. Our cover this week  #Putin #Donbas #Ukraine #Russia

@KremlinRussia_E When nations have a temper tantrum and threaten war unless they get their way, the threat of war should be taken seriously. But not their insipid demands.  Grow up, #putin. #Ukraine
@MavkaSlavka @TheSun @CNN @CNN are fully compliant with the #Moscow false narrative. If the #Kremlin says it in a media release CNN will dutifully project that false narrative. The worst end of this sorry spectrum is @TuckerCarlson of @FoxNews who openly cheers the fascist #Russian invaders of #Ukraine.
Strategic nuclear weapons are used primarily as part of a doctrine of deterrence by threatening large targets, such as [#Kyiv].  Tactical nuclear weapons are for use in limited military maneuvers, such as destroying [#Ukraine‚Äôs] military, communications, or infrastructure targets
The Ukrainian capital Kyiv... #Ukraine .. good night... Merry Christmas 
This action by #Russia is nothing more then a trial run for what they plan to do in the #Ukraine. They will destabilize the government, create a coup de tat, causing civil unrest and then move in‚Ä¶‚Äùinvited‚Äù by the military under the disguise of restore ing order. 
@htTweets NATO on Russia¬¥s doorstep inching into #Ukraine is bringing the world close to world war. Russia will not start the war. Russia will end the war...

Disagree. Putin is strengthening Russian interests by consolidating them.  Putin &amp; Lukashenko are more like Thelma and Louise Kamikaze style with nothing to lose.   With every crackdown &amp; occupation by Russia NATO seems less mobile and more rigid in expansion #Ukraine #Kazakhstan

@emplexx yeah #Ukraine
Following next week's #US-#Russia, #NATO-Russia &amp; OSCE meetings, watch how Moscow acts. That will go long way to answering question of whether Kremlin wants serious discussion on European security or simply seeks to escalate conflict against #Ukraine. 
Putin‚Äôs saber-rattling against Ukraine could be the product of weakness, not strength. And the Kazakhs have reminded the world just how weak Putin‚Äôs grip may well be. The people of #Kazakhstan, #Belarus, #Ukraine &amp; #Georgia have already shown the limits of Putin‚Äôs Soviet dreams.

Hasn't #Russia shown repeatedly that - unlike the #Pentagon's obsession with massive superiority - small but determined deployments can be decisive. #Syria2015 for instance. Therefore #West thinking #Putin is distracted from #Ukraine are missing the point.

@anessen101 @Maria45ma Wrong on all accounts: Nat. Guard troops are training local forces not fighting. Russia spreads westward. Link to Schiff comments about waging war? The US has no military bases in #Ukraine. Russian troops are already  IN Donbas.
In #Kiev, Lieutenant Colonel of the Security Service of #Ukraine (–°–ë–£) with men came to Yeldos #Nasipbekov ‚Äì a coordinator of the opposition movement Democratic Choice of #Kazakhtan for a ‚Äútalk‚Äù just after  Zamanbek #Tleuliyev was beaten by some men claiming to be from # –°–ë–£.

Western Liberal Hegemony biggest dreams (destined to failure):  1) #MiddleEast democratization 2) #Ukraine joining the #Nato 3) #Engagement with #China  By looking at #Hollywood's blockbusters i'm afraid some of these very dangerous dreams are still on. #Geopolitics #Realism

@GicAriana Let's consider it could be a maskirovska in order to achieve their goals against #Ukraine After all, the gaz prices were raised by #russia... I can't imagine they didn't consider that the kazakh population could be upset about it...
@b_nishanov @zhapisheva What about Kremlin propagandist anti-#Ukraine mainstream ? The same pattern now concerning #KazakhstanProtests #Kazakhstan
üá™üá∫‚≠ê The head of European diplomacy #Borrell assured #Ukraine of the "full support" of #Europe in the face of the threat of a Russian intervention.

For all Eastern Rite Ukainian Catholics &amp; Ukrainian Orthodox Christians celebrating Christmas Eve tonight, their thoughts are with the brave Ukrainian soldiers defending their land against Putin's fascist war machine. @Nato's freedom starts in #Ukraine.  #PunishPutin #MerryXmas 
Coordinator of the opposition movement Democratic Choice of #Kazakhtan, Zamanbek #Tleuliyev was attacked by unknown people at home in #Kiev, #Ukraine. Men claim they work for the Security Service of Ukraine (–°–ë–£), yet didn‚Äôt show any papers, hit him in the face &amp; broke his teeth 
Reports that #Ukraine court has frozen assets of former pres Poroshenko inc his TV channels. If true you have to question the motives of pres Zelenskij/ his  advisers. With war probably immeninent this is certain to divide the country not unite it

‚ÄûThe U.S. and the West need to prepare for choppy waters and a rocky ride ahead.‚Äú I couldn‚Äòt agree more! #Russia #Ukraine 
@ForeignPolicy @PieterSlootdorp "For years, Finland and Sweden have worried about how Russia might react to their military decisions"  It's rapidly becoming scary...  #Ukraine #Finland #Kazachstan #Sweden #EU #NATO #Macron #Draghi #energy_prices #COVID19 ; what'll be next?
#Ukraine‚Äôs geographical proximity with both the #EU and #Russia enables it to extend its cooperation across both sides, especially owing to deep historical and cultural ties with Russia, points out Rahul Kamath.

I still cannot understand why people are so stupid and do think Putin wants peace. This is so idiotic and danger. Every time when western politicians speak about peace then nothing but a view of Russian tanks arriving in Europe comes to my mind. #1938Putin #Ukraine #Kazakshtan

I would say it is even more recognizable in the context of #Maidan illegal coup in #Ukraine in 2014 causing enourmous damage to this country up to today. This coup has also become kind of vaccine against #ColorRevolutions for post-Soviet republics #Kazakhstan 
@NotDragonTomas @PoliticalGeeker @nexta_tv  What happened in the end? I will tell you: #NATO. Soon in #Ukraine. üòÇ

Kremlin‚Äôs unwillingness to recognize #Ukraine as a sovereign state has resulted in major strategic failure for #Russia, says Steven Pifer  @Stanford @FSIStanford
2 TV news channels owned by Poroshenko are arrested in #Ukraine. By sanctioning or arresting in less then 1 year 7 TV news channels, which are controlled by leaders of 2 main opposition parties, #Zelensky  surpasses Poroshenko in illegal power grab &amp; assault on opposition #media 
You cannot comprehend how weaker #Russia is these days. Their influence is dwindling day by day and soon they will end up like a whale in a jar. #khazakstan #Ukraine
I'm not one to speculate much but there are concerning parallels to 2014 #Crimea in #Kazakhstan. Whether it leads to similar events is unknown but it could, and we should keep an eye out for such possibilities. #KazakhstanProtests #CentralAsia #Russia #Ukraine #CSTO
I won't be surprised to learn that the sudden outbreak of violent protests in #Kazakhstan has been triggered by Western #Intel Services (#Mi6-@CIA-#French-#Turks) with a view to distracting #Russia from #Ukraine &amp; #Donbass  Where did "#Protesters" get Lethal Weaponry &amp; Training?
"The protracted suspension or cancellation of elections or voting in certain territories [in Donetsk &amp; Luhansk in #Ukraine] would risk unduly infringing the right to vote and be elected," state @osce_odihr &amp; @VeniceComm in their joint opinion
