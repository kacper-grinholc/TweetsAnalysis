Opinionüí≠by Ian Gentles  In spite of what Tucker Carlson thinks, #Ukraine is of considerable strategic importance.  The West should make it clear that any violation of Ukraine‚Äôs borders would be met with armed force. 
The #Ukraine crisis is a creation of the #Globalist American Empire. America‚Äôs ruling elites are willing to risk war, possibly even #nuclear war, for the sake of their own desire to exert control everywhere on Earth. @DarrenJBeattie 
Wow, angry old man biden  #JoeBiden  #JoeBidenDelivers  #Ukraine #UkraineCrisis 
President Zelensky: Had a long phone conversation with  @POTUS. Discussed recent diplomatic efforts on de-escalation &amp; agreed on joint actions for the future. Thanked President  @JoeBiden for the ongoing military assistance  #Ukraine #US #Russia
"Prepare for impact bal...you are going in for a problem"  #Ukraine  
@RienNavelpluis Whats so important in the  #ukraine ? Found this and made a screenshot of before it,s deleted. If tru it doesnt look good üí• 
Putin also has a number of effective levers he can employ immediately against #Erdogan should #Ankara pursue a forward policy on #Ukraine. 3/4 @SonerCagaptay
Why would Erdogan react with such caution if Putin decided to invade #Ukraine? Mostly due to the challenges he faces in #Turkey including the economy and the #COVID19 pandemic, says @SonerCagaptay. 2/4
When Putin attacks the homeland, Biden ain't going to do shit. When there are no more American embassies to hand over, the only thing that remains is America itself. #Afghanistan #Ukraine
Tune in to ‚ÄòThe Ideas Factory,‚Äô with Harsh V Pant &amp; @NaghmaSahar, as they discuss the #USRussia tango over #Ukraine, #SriLanka balancing #China and #India, and #NewDelhi‚Äôs tightrope on #Myanmar.  LISTEN NOW ‚û°Ô∏è  #US #Russia #IndiaMyanmar #PolicyPod 
Canadians support a stronger, more principled foreign policy that asserts our interests, stands up for democracy, &amp; works hand in hand with allies &amp; partners. Canada's response to Russian aggression toward #Ukraine is an opportunity to deploy such a policy 
Canada should leverage existing commitments to the region to rally allies to the cause of greater transatlantic solidarity as we stare down security challenges emanating particularly from Russia and China @WaschukCanUA @A_Sannikov #cdnpoli #cdnfp #Ukraine  
"If Canada, the United States and our allies genuinely wish to champion our shared democratic values, that battle must begin by defending aspiring democracies like #Ukraine." #cdnpoli #cdnfp  
THREAD: How should Canada &amp; our allies respond to #Russia's build up &amp; threats against #Ukraine? Key to understanding how to respond is understanding what Putin wants. @BalkanDevlen argues that Putin most likely wants to vassalize #Ukraine. #cdnpoli 
Hu tells the truth. #China #Russia #Ukraine #Biden #UkraineConflict #UkraineCrisis #NeverAgain #NATO

#Hope #USA #EU is not #Ukraine on board because of Trump's return threat not #LockHimUp &amp; that won't stop him from seeking a likely GOP nomination &amp; what will the DOJ do to allow him to serve a term, from jail cell to Inauguration? #Jan6 anything possible
