Given timing, have to ask, is this #China, and #Russia, trying to nobble response from #USA, #UK, #Europe, before they both move to annex other countries, like #Taiwan, and #Ukraine&gt;&gt;&gt; a nuclear response would be most unwelcome, to their aggression?? 
@IManole17 @Jills11435137 @Je5usaurus_Rex @dmarusic @IlvesToomas In my opinion the real issue here was and is #NATO enlargement into former EastBloc and even Post Soviet Space. This was and is a big mistake. Of course: in is in (Baltics). But no new members in the East. We need to change our course. It is very long overdue... #Ukraine #Georgia

An impressive display of your mastery of the Ukrainian language - but if you wish to prevent a war in Ukraine I suggest you spend your time talking to Putin. What the world needs right now is more MacMillans and less Churchills #Ukraine

Jaw-jaws play down war-wars, because that's what jaw-jaws are trained to do. Remember: diplomats, though well intentioned, may not have the realism and foresight of the military. Now is a time for military thinking and decisions, if we are to avoid more war-war. #Russia #Ukraine

Now  Timothy Snyder, lecture on #Ukraine #TimothySnyderspeaks #Putin #redline  ! tune in here : 
#Biden told #Ukraine's president that the US was committed to its 'sovereignty and territorial integrity' if #Russia invades    
@Malinka1102 😊 All money which the German Green Party paid to @summlenny was for nothing. Maybe he can now finally close his office in #Kiev after revolutions and western values didn’t succeed in #belarus, #russia and #ukraine 😊 
#Russia, a country that brings only misery and to its people, consoles itself by bringing misery to its neighbors and Syria. #Ukraine #Georgia #Moldova

Biden to act decisively if Russia invades Ukraine  #Biden #Ukraine #Russia #Kremlin 
(Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty) #Putin/#Russia &amp; #Lukashenko/#Belarus dictators plan Joint War Games  Puts pressure on #Ukraine northwestern front. 
terrific from @LievenAnatol - what worked for #Austria &amp; #Finland could work for #Ukraine  NB 'as w/ the Austrian Treaty, /neutrality/ would also block a Ukrainian alliance with Russia; &amp; the loss this would cause to Russian interests vastly outweighs damage to those of the West' 
@McFaul @john_sipher Seems that #Ukraine agreeing to not seek #NATO membership would be a confirmation that they are not sovereign &amp; instead bending to #Putin’s &amp; #Russia’s will.
What’s most upsetting?  Can’t get a #COVID test  Different rules &amp; messaging daily   Mandates &amp; lockdowns  No focus on therapeutics as we begin our 3rd yr w #COVID19  Inflation  Crime  Open border  Foreign Policy  No confidence in leadership  #OmicronCases #Russia #Ukraine #China 
#Estonia has made a principled decision to support #Ukraine in its current #security situation. The plan is to donate and send missile and artillery systems designed for anti-tank defence.  By Pekka Vanttinen. 
@ulrichspeck I agree with you very frequently, but not on this one. It is a mistake - no sign of strategy, international mandate or solidarity visible in this ill-timed quest. Plenty of ways to deliver messages - in writing, in public statements, but best of all, by concrete help to #Ukraine
Where's this one going? #Ukraine ?  [33].000 ft  
#Ukraine - "No One in Kyiv Knows Whether #Russia Is Bluffing" 
@JohnnyHeldt Forgot about #Ukraine? 10% to #TheBigGuy? #Burisma #TonyBobulinski
I wonder if #Trump was fulfilling an agreement to #Putin, in return for his help of STEALING the #2016Election? #RepAdamSchiff If he did shut it down, hope #Biden's Admin has reinstated that program. Otherwise, we couldn't track #Russiantroops around #Ukraine. #RepAOC #IlhanMN

Among the gems from this conversation: The driver said that, at his former workplace, many employees got #COVID19 and came to work in spite of it.  I inquired what company it was. He wouldn't say, but told me the general economic sector: food manufacturing. 🤦‍♂️ #Ukraine
"As much as he may want to use force to try to change the reality in Ukraine, he has to be aware that the Russian people are not interested in going to war with #Ukraine," says @kennaninstitute expert Matt Rojansky⤵️
Important call with my 🇺🇸 colleague @SecBlinken &amp; FM from #B9 countries to discuss support for #Ukraine 🇺🇦 &amp; upcoming @NATO-Russia 🇷🇺 dialogue. We continue close coordination among Allies. 
@BrigMahalingam @CAFinUkraine And #naturalgas to be kept very much in mind when considering #Germany's (and #EU's) approach to #Russia, esp. in view of current electricity woes ( @adam_tooze  #Ukraine #NordStream2
‘Biden Vows US to Act Decisively if Russia Invades #Ukraine’  “Biden has spoken of hitting Russia with economy-jarring sanctions if it moves on Ukraine's territory, but he said last month that U.S. military action is not on the table.”  #war

After my first #Poll am interested to know #peoples feelings about the follow: As a lot of media attention focuses on a #Russian #war with #Ukraine, do people think there will be another #Serbian conflict in the #balkans ? #news #Warzone #NATO #journalism #Questions
Biden &amp; Putin had a conversation Sunday. We need transcripts of the call to be sure @POTUS wasn’t compromised based off his son’s dealings with Ukraine. #transparency #Ukraine
@tass_agency #Ukraine is an Internationally recognized sovereign country.  @KremlinRussia_E has illegally invaded &amp; occupied 7% of Ukrainian land.  That’s a crime.  Get out of #Ukraine and problems solved, after paying for all damage caused by aggressor #Russia.
Good read- Article by the former SG ⁦of #Nato Rusmussen @AndersFoghR⁩ : “We promised both #Georgia 🇬🇪&amp;  #Ukraine 🇺🇦 seats at NATO table in 2008 and it’s time we set out an action plan to realize our promise”. ⁦@DZalkaliani⁩ @LashaDarsalia2⁩  
Much to the chagrin of the West, #Russia continues to display aggression on the #Ukraine front. Does this represent an opportunity for closer EU-Ukraine relations? Rahul Kamath explains. 
“Mythmaking presents Russia as a besieged fortress, justified in silencing critics at home or in defending itself from mendacious and threatening outsiders — for example #Ukraine….”
