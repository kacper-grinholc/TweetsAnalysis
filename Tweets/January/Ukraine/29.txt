BREAKING: Britain considering major #NATO deployment amid #Ukraine crisis
@jlhatty @ChristopherJM @guardian I am fully aware that some of Russia have that postion. But in this case 'region' just refers to the region the country of #Ukraine is located in. That's all. Really :)
Significant: Long Convoy of #Russia Fueling &amp; Pipeline spotted in Krasnodar, SW, not too far from #Ukraine.   Another warning sign of potential attack, one that secures fuel &amp; logistical preparedness for Moscow: 
#Potus #WhiteHouse #Ukraine The Ukrainian Army sent you a request and their Generals state you are ghosting him?? Get on the ball Biden #moderateDemocrat . FYI, we need Armor on the ground, not just paratroopers. Btw, FULFILL Poland’s M1 Tank orders.

Excellent conversation between @Paul__Jay and Larry Wilkerson on #Ukraine, #NATO, and the US military-industrial complex:
"He (Biden) and his incompetent foreign policy team have spun a tale about a pending Russian attack on Ukraine. In reality, it is the U.S. that is ginning up war by provoking the Ukrainians to start a fight that they can’t win." #Empire #Russia #Ukraine  
#ukraine Schäm dich Deutchland.  Shame on u Europe for your weak knee nonsupport as Russia bullies its neighbors into vassal states.  Nato should stand together. Strength in numbers.  Open the Silos and threaten MAD just like USA did to protect China if 🇷🇺  doesn't standdown.
🇬🇧🇺🇦British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered the Armed Forces to be ready to be transferred to Europe amid the Ukrainian crisis.   In addition, the UK is about to offer NATO to provide a large military contingent and military equipment. #Ukraine #Russia 
I've sent this to Putin surely he can't invade Ukraine after seeing our two cute cats #Putin #Ukraine #Ukraine

Every time I see news on N.Korea firing a missle, #Russia , #Ukraine, or #StockMarket crash 
So #BoJo is going to #Ukraine to amuse #Putin. Not very amusing to those of us in the country of which Johnson is beleaguered Prime Minister
He @GNev2 will wait till the 1st half whistle then give his assessment of the #Ukraine v #NATO match! 
We won't protect and defend our own border but we'll monitor and consider protecting the #Ukraine border...we have no business taking the lead in this debacle.  If there is a true Russian threat, W. Europe needs to take the lead. @JoeBiden #StayInYourLane

#Ukraine is about to explode but the uberlords at @ABC decides that Tom Brady’s maybe-but-not-really retirement is the second most important news story in America.   And we wonder why the world is in crisis.
Putin doesn't give a fuck. I'm old enough to remember when the US Military was feared. #Ukraine #Russia  
Doubt Putin is foolish enough to invade having masterfully out maneuvered NATO under a panicked Biden administration. #Putin #Ukraine #ReleaseTheTranscipt 
The American PEOPLE dont want war. #fuckwar   Why does it feel like our government is instigating the issue. #Russia #Ukraine #nato
@mpchc1 Well my lady friend in #Ukraine said the US is making a big deal about it.  Problem is, the people in #Ukraine are being kept in the dark to avoid panic.  #Putin wants attention like a little toddler in addition to create chaos in the west so he can get Trump back in.  No.
I’ve had a month off from the cameras and some much-needed leave but am THRILLED to be back in studio tonight and can’t wait to get on-air and speak to you! We’ll be talking US storm, #Ukraine, and #TomBrady retirement. Join me @BBCNews @BBCWorld from 8pm ET/1am UK/ 9am Singapore 
@crampell @WHCOS Russia's demand #Ukraine not be a part of #NATO reflects legitimate concerns about U.S. bases, missiles, &amp; troops on Russia’s border in a US military base that once belonged to #Russia. @POTUS, agree to a moratorium on NATO expansion. Be reasonable. @SecBlinken @DeputySecState
In 2014 Russia gained #Crimea, but lost ##Ukraine (for foreseeable future). While that looks big net net loss, maybe not in eyes of #Russia 
@crampell @WHCOS Even a broken anti-vaxxed cuckoo clock is right twice a day. Didn't Flynn warn us about NATO endangering peace w/expansion into Eastern Europe? Tell @POTUS no more weapons for #Ukraine. Negotiate. #NoWarWithRussia
let's communicate :) What u do? #Nft #NFTCommunity #Ukraine 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦 
US Charge d'affair to Ukraine on NBC news saying the Ukrainian army and people are "ready for this". Referring to possible Russian invasion. Gotta say, if  invasion by Russia takes place,  ukrainians are not ready for what it would be. #Ukraine #UkraineConflict #UkraineCrisis
The west wants to save #Ukraine like it saved #Iraq #Afghanistan #Syria and #Libya.
#KillerPutin is threatening to invade (further into) #Ukraine.  Meanwhile #MAGA #Maskholes have 'invaded' Canada! 
Whatever @BorisJohnson was up to in Russia when he arrived, disheveled (as per) hung over and still loaded at the airport will give Putin great amusement when he’s getting a”stern talking to” from the blob!   #Ukraine #VladimirPutin #JohnsonOut5 #JohnsonMustResign
The cardboard rifles demonstrate the incredible bravery and stoicism of the Ukrainian people #Ukraine #NATO 
@EmmaKennedy @DavidLammy But what if, whilst he's in the #Ukraine, he phones #Putin and "warns him not to invade". Then Putin doesn't invade - who will get the credit for changing the course of world history?

Britain considering major #NATO deployment amid #Ukraine crisis as part of a plan to strengthen Europe's borders in response to #Russia massing troops on the border with Ukraine, the government said on Saturday. 
So now this arsehole warmonger is saying #Russia is Al Qaeda and their beef with the United States and NATO over #Ukraine is the same as knocking down two twin towers on 9/11. They want to cancel @joerogan and @TuckerCarlson, and anyone else who interferes with their agenda.

Russia announced that those living in Donetsk and Luhansk can be called up for Russian Military service. To be fair, this was already true… which makes making the announcement a bit stranger #UkraineInvasion #ukrainerussia #Ukraine

Very impressive opinion. At this stage the risk of loss of face for #Putin is likely too high for simply withdrawing his troops from the border. But supporting #Ukraine raises the price to pay for invasion by the hour.

After Kazakhstan, the color revolution era is over   Western plots in preparations to impede Russian plans in #Ukraine.
A rally is held in Kiev, near the walls of the Verkhovna Rada, demanding that President of #Ukraine Volodymyr #Zelensky prevent a war with #Russia.   ■Meanwhile, the West's statement of "Russian Aggression" is a pretext for NATO contingent to be near Russian border.

.@Malinowski is a warmonger. Before he even considers advocating for funding that benefits his constituents in #NewJersey, he wants to ensure the government has set aside enough funding for mass death and destruction on the other side of the world. #Ukraine #Russia

@noclador ZE doesnt want millions of UKR people to panic &amp; head towards western borders in cold weather?   #Ukraine might repel Russians with regular military units armed with modern weaponry. #Azerbaijan didnt use reservists when liberated #Karabakh. BM strikes of #Baku was turning point!

Sr. Fellow David Carment @cdnfp and Dani Belo suggest that lethal aid to #Ukraine 🇺🇦 will not enhance Canada's standing given its absence from diplomatic fora and that "crisis escalation carries few long-term security benefits." #cdnfp  Their analysis: 
2. From the first days in the office the team of Zelensky has been focused on the concentration of power. That started from the non-constitutional moving of parliament elections, allowing the party of Zelensky to gain the number of seats unprecedented for the history of #Ukraine
Using politics as a vehicle for money is despicable.  If money comes from Putin, it's disgusting. And if you say peace talks of your country FM are a provocation to your #Kremlin friends, then you're worse than #Putin himself. #Schroeder #Russia #Germany #Ukraine #UkraineConflict
