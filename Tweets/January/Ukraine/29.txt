BREAKING: Britain considering major #NATO deployment amid #Ukraine crisis
@jlhatty @ChristopherJM @guardian I am fully aware that some of Russia have that postion. But in this case 'region' just refers to the region the country of #Ukraine is located in. That's all. Really :)
Significant: Long Convoy of #Russia Fueling &amp; Pipeline spotted in Krasnodar, SW, not too far from #Ukraine.   Another warning sign of potential attack, one that secures fuel &amp; logistical preparedness for Moscow: 
#Potus #WhiteHouse #Ukraine The Ukrainian Army sent you a request and their Generals state you are ghosting him?? Get on the ball Biden #moderateDemocrat . FYI, we need Armor on the ground, not just paratroopers. Btw, FULFILL Poland‚Äôs M1 Tank orders.

Excellent conversation between @Paul__Jay and Larry Wilkerson on #Ukraine, #NATO, and the US military-industrial complex:
"He (Biden) and his incompetent foreign policy team have spun a tale about a pending Russian attack on Ukraine. In reality, it is the U.S. that is ginning up war by provoking the Ukrainians to start a fight that they can‚Äôt win." #Empire #Russia #Ukraine  
#ukraine Sch√§m dich Deutchland.  Shame on u Europe for your weak knee nonsupport as Russia bullies its neighbors into vassal states.  Nato should stand together. Strength in numbers.  Open the Silos and threaten MAD just like USA did to protect China if üá∑üá∫  doesn't standdown.
üá¨üáßüá∫üá¶British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered the Armed Forces to be ready to be transferred to Europe amid the Ukrainian crisis.   In addition, the UK is about to offer NATO to provide a large military contingent and military equipment. #Ukraine #Russia

So #BoJo is going to #Ukraine to amuse #Putin. Not very amusing to those of us in the country of which Johnson is beleaguered Prime Minister
He @GNev2 will wait till the 1st half whistle then give his assessment of the #Ukraine v #NATO match! 
We won't protect and defend our own border but we'll monitor and consider protecting the #Ukraine border...we have no business taking the lead in this debacle.  If there is a true Russian threat, W. Europe needs to take the lead. @JoeBiden #StayInYourLane

#Ukraine is about to explode but the uberlords at @ABC decides that Tom Brady‚Äôs maybe-but-not-really retirement is the second most important news story in America.   And we wonder why the world is in crisis.
Putin doesn't give a fuck. I'm old enough to remember when the US Military was feared. #Ukraine #Russia

@mpchc1 Well my lady friend in #Ukraine said the US is making a big deal about it.  Problem is, the people in #Ukraine are being kept in the dark to avoid panic.  #Putin wants attention like a little toddler in addition to create chaos in the west so he can get Trump back in.  No.
I‚Äôve had a month off from the cameras and some much-needed leave but am THRILLED to be back in studio tonight and can‚Äôt wait to get on-air and speak to you! We‚Äôll be talking US storm, #Ukraine, and #TomBrady retirement. Join me @BBCNews @BBCWorld from 8pm ET/1am UK/ 9am Singapore 
@crampell @WHCOS Russia's demand #Ukraine not be a part of #NATO reflects legitimate concerns about U.S. bases, missiles, &amp; troops on Russia‚Äôs border in a US military base that once belonged to #Russia. @POTUS, agree to a moratorium on NATO expansion. Be reasonable. @SecBlinken @DeputySecState
In 2014 Russia gained #Crimea, but lost ##Ukraine (for foreseeable future). While that looks big net net loss, maybe not in eyes of #Russia 
@crampell @WHCOS Even a broken anti-vaxxed cuckoo clock is right twice a day. Didn't Flynn warn us about NATO endangering peace w/expansion into Eastern Europe? Tell @POTUS no more weapons for #Ukraine. Negotiate. #NoWarWithRussia

Very impressive opinion. At this stage the risk of loss of face for #Putin is likely too high for simply withdrawing his troops from the border. But supporting #Ukraine raises the price to pay for invasion by the hour.

#Russia and #Ukraine's game is watching good excitement! Who is the Mastermind? #UK says to prepare for the army! #Turkey (#nato) will give the final dose, then all cold!
All players involved in the current dialogue over the #Ukraine crisis cannot afford for it to escalate but must use the opportunity to reconstruct existing #European security architecture. From @niveditakapoor. 
4. Among many issues with having an ex-comedian without a good education and cognitive skills as the head of the state his absolute ignorance of Ukraine itself, Ukrainian people as a democratic and free nation is crushing every effort of Ukrainians to build #Ukraine.
Former üá∑üá∫ FM Igor #Ivanov has a good question: who would dare to take the responsibility for a new war in #Europe? There is a warning there with an obvious address.: @carlbildt   #Diplomacy140 #Russia #Ukraine #Putin #EuropeanSecurity

In his call with @EmmanuelMacron üá´üá∑ President #Putin üá∑üá∫ repeated his demand to roll all @nato infrastructure in #Europe back to 1997. There is simply no way this demand will be meet.: @carlbildt   #Diplomacy140 #EuropeanSecurity #Ukraine #Moscow #France #Macron #Russia #Nato

After Kazakhstan, the color revolution era is over   Western plots in preparations to impede Russian plans in #Ukraine.
A rally is held in Kiev, near the walls of the Verkhovna Rada, demanding that President of #Ukraine Volodymyr #Zelensky prevent a war with #Russia.   ‚ñ†Meanwhile, the West's statement of "Russian Aggression" is a pretext for NATO contingent to be near Russian border.

.@Malinowski is a warmonger. Before he even considers advocating for funding that benefits his constituents in #NewJersey, he wants to ensure the government has set aside enough funding for mass death and destruction on the other side of the world. #Ukraine #Russia

@noclador ZE doesnt want millions of UKR people to panic &amp; head towards western borders in cold weather?   #Ukraine might repel Russians with regular military units armed with modern weaponry. #Azerbaijan didnt use reservists when liberated #Karabakh. BM strikes of #Baku was turning point!

#Opinion: what if the whole #Ukraine situation isn't about them, but about #Burisma. @JoeBiden signed off on #Northstream2. Environmental laws said he shouldn't. Burisma ties with #HunterBiden. If the #pipeline is stopped, Burisma benefits so does #Biden. #USFalseFlag #USA
#Opinion: #Biden and #Democrats have sons and other family tied to #Ukraine #Gas companies.  Leaves me with questions on the #UkraineCrisis. Is #Russia really pushing #invasion for a #Unification of former #USSR territory back into #Russian States? Or, is it a #USFalseFlag? #USA
Sr. Fellow David Carment @cdnfp and Dani Belo suggest that lethal aid to #Ukraine üá∫üá¶ will not enhance Canada's standing given its absence from diplomatic fora and that "crisis escalation carries few long-term security benefits." #cdnfp  Their analysis: 
2. From the first days in the office the team of Zelensky has been focused on the concentration of power. That started from the non-constitutional moving of parliament elections, allowing the party of Zelensky to gain the number of seats unprecedented for the history of #Ukraine
Using politics as a vehicle for money is despicable.  If money comes from Putin, it's disgusting. And if you say peace talks of your country FM are a provocation to your #Kremlin friends, then you're worse than #Putin himself. #Schroeder #Russia #Germany #Ukraine #UkraineConflict
