This is one reason we have to protect #Ukraine in any way necessary; they wouldn't be in this kind of danger if not for #TFG. He and his thralls need to get smacked down, or there will be authoritarian land-grabs all over the world. 
#Maidan #Ukraine #Russia   This is what Ukraine's new Western 'allies' are after. And Zelensky and Poroshenko are the puppets placed there to broker the deals. 
He is weak figurehead . His record in office proves that he never steps out of #Ukronazi - influenced Russophobe line . But in a way, he proves #Putin’s point that #Ukraine is really part of the Russian world . Russian is his native language etc. @RusEmbAU . #auspol By @tonykevin 
Mr. #Lavrov said the United States had agreed to give written answers to all #Russian security requests and that the two sides planned to continue their security dialogue on #Ukraine. He also dismissed talk of A russian "invasion" of Ukraine as western "hysteria".

This is what Maidan was all about. #Russia #Ukraine #NATO 
We need a major regional war to overcome the next financial disaster! #Ukraine &amp; #Taiwan (along side a major crisis in #Turkey) could indicate a reshape of the #geopolitics and #financial system. Maybe this sounds abstract, but what if there is just a trigger?!

#Germany  Blocks #NATO  Ally From Transferring Weapons to #Ukraine 
What does #Putin want in #Ukraine? •Ukraine in Russian "sphere" •No @NATO expansion into Ukraine •No weapons sent to Ukraine •No investment (done! see below) •Look away when Russia invades on some excuse like "protecting our nationals." •He'll even promise not to! #HongKong 
Hey @GOP   Make it happen.   @JoeBiden is guilty of everything Democrats accused Trump of.   #RussianCollusion: giving Putin the 👍🏻to invade Ukraine.   #QuidProQuo with #Ukraine. 
#Russia has climbed the ranks to become the largest #wheat exporter in the world. There would still be a risk to Russian #gas flows via #Ukraine to #Europe. Potential impact on the production and export of Ukrainian #corn and #wheat. 
In wargaming terms, a war between these two would end up like the standard 3 to 1 roll on Tobruk in Afrika Korps. In short, a done deal…  #Ukraine 
It’s amazing how the mighty USA, UK and Europe allow the cross-eyed, piss-ant Putin to call the shots. The free world’s defense industries must need some money? It’s all an orchestrated scam by all parties, including RuSSia. #ukraine
How #Putin’s obsession with @NATO has led to the brink of war in #Ukraine 
Germany, the new France, you know the one it wishes to replicate from 1940. The one that just bends over and takes it up the "chain of command". No balls #Germany  Don't worry #Ukraine  #Canada and your REAL allies got your back! 
Do you guys realize we are about to get sucked in to a war between #Ukraine and #Putin?   IMO, if Putin does invade #Ukraine, we Americans have to jump in to help, because Ukraine is our ally. And we don't abandon our allies. Plus, I'm so sick of Putin. He's why we have TFG.

@SecBlinken warns any Russian 'invasion' of #Ukraine would be met with a 'severe and a united response' following #Lavrov meeting. #Blinken #US #unitedstates #Russia 
#Russia does. not. care. what the West/#Nato says or does re #Ukraine. They have calculated &amp; predicted all the West's possible responses. They're just waiting for the inevitable faux pas from some Ukrainian trooper to send in their 100k army.
#Germany Blocks NATO Partners From Supplying Its Weapons To #Ukraine 
Sr. Fellow @Irrussianality commented on 🇺🇦 #Ukraine, suggesting parties should at minimum seek "some sort of permanent peace by freezing the conflict, having a genuine ceasefire, some international peacekeeping force."  Watch IPD's panel with @NATOCanada:  
#Ukraine needs to GET TF OVER Biden's comment. We are being their biggest allies and they are b!tching over a benign line from a press conference. 🙄🙄🙄 
🧵Possible/probable that absolute rudderless incompetence is at work in the White House but #Biden's "minor incursion" gaffe could be political genius, sending exactly the right message to #Russia #Ukraine and the world.
When #russia invades #Ukraine , the western powers  ( #nato ) won’t do a thing other than put in place economic sanctions…
Questions from the “little people” around the world: Why has #Russia continually stationed its weapons &amp; troops around #Ukraine’s borders? Russia did invade the Ukraine a few yrs ago. Why’s it any strange if other countries send theUkraine defense weapons? 
@MollyMcKew @GermanyDiplo is referring to historic reasons without perhaps understanding that they are implicitly replaying Molotov-Ribbentrop. Although this is so obvious. #Germany #Ukraine
Can't help wondering how much consideration was given to the timing of this particular meeting...  #Ukraine #Russia #RussiaUkraine 
Was the use of #Swift in Blinken's speech a double entendre?   #Diplomacy #Ukraine
@ForeignPolicy I want to see the conflict in #Ukraine reported as a civil war, and more on the situation in Donetsk and east.
Desp the header's reference to "alignment" on #Russia, an anonymous US official said, "We did not get into the specifics about possible steps that wd be taken in the event" that #Putin invades #Ukraine. I.e., no #Japan promise of #sanctions:   #allies?

Excellent analysis by #RoryStewart re: #Russian made crisis over #Ukraine; Vacillation in #NATO + the #EU + poor leadership by the #US have emboldened #Putin to use Ukraine to alter #European #security arrangements. Has the #West any choice  but to arm Ukraine to defend itself? 
#NATO should have a coordinated effort to supply #Ukraine with what it needs as quickly and efficiently as possible. Instead we got the U.K. and the Baltic states all doing there own thing, and Biden not knowing what day of the week it is.
It rather worries me at the complete mess NATO is currently in with Ukraine. Having a member of the alliance veto’ing the donation of arms to a “partner” state that’s at risk of imminent invasion is fucking disgraceful.  #NATO #Ukraine #Germany
How naive the #serbs are to believe #Putin and #Russia has a genuine interest in looking out for them when they don’t have scruples about suffocating much closer brethren in #Ukraine.
it is very strange in #europe as 50+ to see that #extremeright is now siding with #russia while democrats are siding with #usa #navo to defend the right to chose for democracy and free market #ukraine ... weren't they anticommunist and prowestern and we the 'communists' ? 
Germany doesn't support arming Ukraine.  Is this because of the new diplomacy-oriented government agenda or the fact that the country is dependent on Russian gas?  Not saying one or the other is 100% true, but just wondering..  #germany #russia #ukraine

Obviously, I am with #ukraine - but I am not jumping on this bandwagon blind until I understand it.  #russia has paid more price for our society in the wars than any of us.
This so disturbing. If #Ukraine is not planning to join #NATO, which by the way is an aggressor rather than stabilizer, then why are NATO forces including Canada there? The west needs to mind its business not start wars with  #nuclear risk. #peace #cdnpoli #diplomacy

@oleksiireznikov @StateDept #UkraineCrisis #Ukraine  The U.S. supports you. President Biden is NOT Trump. Trump would sell you out to Putin in appeasement.

@Billbrowder Russia has been waging war against the U.S. &amp; Ukraine for many years. We need to team up with Ukraine to fight back. #Ukraine
The great propaganda success of US is in characterising #Russia as the aggressor, whereas  NATO has moved into #Ukraine and is on the borders of Russia. For the most Russia's actions have been defensive in face of massive change in military threat from NATO @fleetstreetfox @FT
Disappointing discussions about #Ukraine on #skypapers ignoring history before 2014. In 2014 Ukraine was a neutral state, then #US engineered riots which removed legal govt and moved country towards #NATO.  What Putin wants is guarentee that Ukraine won't be allowed to join NATO
