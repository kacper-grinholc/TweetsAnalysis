Considering the #Russia-#US and #Russia-#NATO talks are next week, and the outcome looks like diplomatic overtures won't sway Russia, when do you think it will invade more of #Ukraine? Vote and reply with your thoughts.
"At some stage, there must be political and legal peace in such a discussion": SPD General Secretary @KuehniKev on NS2 pipeline  Eastern Europeans, Ukrainians expecially, would no doubt also like political and legal peace. #NordStream2 #Ukraine  
#Ukraine #Russianarmy #Donbas  Interesting revelations from Ukrainian commandos on the front line in Donbas: Russia's Orlan-10 UAV has been upgraded to operate at an altitude of up to 6.5 km, making the drone invulnerable to the current Ukrainian EW in the zone. 
Good. Zelensky had asked for them since #Ukraine needs them to defend against Putin/Russia invasion. 
since Putin gang couldn't have all of #Ukraine , they decided to have #Kazakhstan . It didn't work out for them in Afghanistan. They should learn a history lesson.

Ukraine Situation Talks with US High-ranking Russia “Controversial” - #ukraine #russia #moscow #kyiv #us 
Economic sanctions may not be sufficient to deter #Russia from another attack against #Ukraine . Putin’s favorite tool of military intimidation must be undermined by a renewed U.S. and NATO military posture in Europe and military aid for Ukraine.  
FACT: Transatlantic community broadly opposes #NordStream2. Not only #Ukraine &amp; CEE nations, but Nordics, UK, Canada, etc have publicly opposed. EU Parliament voted to STOP #NS2 multiple times in past 3 years by overwhelming majorities. #NordStream2 is a Kremlin, not EU, project.

FACT: #NordStream2 is not designed to bring significant new gas volumes to #Germany &amp; points West – design only intends 9.9 of the 55 bcma capacity for that direction. Aim of the #Kremlin project is to end gas transit via #Ukraine, harming Kyiv’s economic &amp; national security.

#Kazakhstan #Myanmar #Ukraine #Turkey #Iran &amp; #SaudiArabia are all examples of what the #USInsurrectionistGOP want @ their disposal during the next #Coup attempt.  #VoteBlue2022 = #LastCall Kazakhstan gives 'kill without warning'-bodies lie in the streets 
#Ukraine’s geographical proximity with both the #EU and #Russia enables it to extend its cooperation across both sides, especially owing to deep historical and cultural ties with Russia, points out Rahul Kamath. 
When the Russian🇷🇺 military intel group known as Sandworm 🪖disrupted the Prykarpattyaoblenergo control center of Ukraine’s 🇺🇦electrical grid, the relevant dyadic actors were Sandworm vs Prykarpattyaoblenergo, not #Russia versus #Ukraine.   #technology
Sanctions on Russia by the US has severly impacted EU countries. There're several industries that has been hit. Given the current situation on the #Ukraine border more penalties will not solve the issue rather impact EU countries (for ex Germany) Diplomatic solution are required.

CNN: The #أوكرانيا president is frustrated with Biden's position on a possible Russian invasion of his country.  No kidding. "Frustrated" isn't even the word for it! #Biden is giving away the store to #Russia in exchange for private deals of no benefit to the US or #Ukraine!

Blinken: #Russia, not #NATO, invaded #Ukraine and Georgia 
“That’s like the fox saying it had to attack the hen house because its occupants somehow pose a threat,” Blinken said. “We’ve seen this gaslighting before.” #Ukraine 
US Secretary of State Antony #Blinken has threatened #Russia with “massive consequences” if it launches any military action in neighboring #Ukraine, despite the fact that #Moscow has rejected Washington’s allegations of preparing to invade the neighboring country. 
So, it's war then.    #Russia #Ukraine #UkraineWillResist
The #US_EU dispute with #Russia over #Ukraine will be threats to peace in 2022. West is not reluctant to incite Kiev to go to war with Moscow and  involve Russia in a serious conflict. It may be the beginning of a confrontation in the #Donbas region.
Nice, relaxing morning listening to a @BerlinPhil recording of Pictures at an Exhibition…ended with me explaining to my 9yo the geopolitical situation in #Russia/#Ukraine, likelihood of global involvement (little to none) &amp; “diplomatic responses.” #geopolitics  #ClassicalMusic 
Congress’ #EastMedAct and the #US-#GR #IPPA conflict, at the very least in spirit, with this policy position out of @StateDept. I personally believe it has nothing to do with economic viability, and everything to do with developments in #Russia and #Ukraine. 
Alleged #Russian strike group near the borders with #Ukraine, according to Western intelligence services. 
What’s going on in #Kazakhstan &amp; #Ukraine should remind us all just what’s at stake on the global stage. Our foes must be reminded we will not back down, leave our allies behind, &amp; sit idly by while our leadership, resolve, &amp; interests are challenged. 
#Biden is too weak to intervene militarily in #Ukraine
@jec79 @eriq49 #Ukraine is not a member of #NATO; Canada has no bilateral defence treaty with Ukraine, no obligations; the country is not one of our "allies". Our only allies are NATO members as we have no defence treaties with other states. #cdnfp @nspector4 @melaniejoly @CanadaFP @CanadaNATO
#Ahead of talks on #Ukraine, #Blinken says NATO prepared to respond to #RussianAggression.
What Russia fears the most is #Ukraine and #Georgia becoming strong and consolidated democracies, hence the Kremlin losing leverage in it’s “sphere of influence”. 🇷🇺 is ready to use all means to portray 🇺🇦 and 🇬🇪 as failed states, unworthy of #NATO membership.
happening in Kazakhstan coincided with the exacerbation of the crisis between #Ukraine 🇺🇦, a NATO ally with Russia therefore, we find the opening of the crisis in Kazakhstan a message to the Russian President #Vladimir_Putin that NATO, led by Washington, can transfer chaos ..
Academic: Biden is trying to figure out what exactly Putin wants  @American political analyst and academic Kurk Dorsey says US President @JoeBiden is trying to figure out what exactly #Russian President Vladimir Putin wants out of the situation in #Ukraine.  #SinglesInferno 
IMO if #Russia keeps the puppet in power, there won't be any need for annexation, but if it fails like in #Ukraine, Russia may retreat the Ukraine scenario and annex the bulk of #Kazakhstan, specially where the strategic Russian assets located like the space launch and uranium

I joined the great @Boris_Sanchez on @CNNnewsroom  this morning to talk about #Kazakhstan, #Ukraine, #Putin, and how all dictators and thugs try to bully the West and their own people, but we shouldn't let them. Check it out:

#Putin needs consensus too. The attention the West is giving him, and the talks #Russia will have in Geneva etc., in the coming days, are a huge propaganda success for the Russian president. Excellent article in Finnish⬇️(use Google Translate).  #Ukraine
