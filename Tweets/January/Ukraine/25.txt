No threat of invasion by #Russia against #Ukaine. Russia is saying that. Moreover, officials in #Ukraine including #Zelensky are saying that. Yet, Western media, but also "blind &amp; deaf" politicians are instigating, fueling and spreading panic, hysteria of fake imminent invasion

#STUPID people still do NOT get the #UKRAINE issue. This is about WARM WATER #RUSSIA #NAVY PORTS! AND, if take all Ukraine, #FOOD (crops) for #RUSSIA so they can BUY LESS from the West. AND, then #CHINA (to then move on others) due to lack of #USA actions. #USWeaknessEmboldens
OK Patriots, I'm not given up on return of the Best President EVER in history. Now #Mushbrains is sending  5,000 troops to #Ukraine. I thought military was in charge? 😡🤷‍♀️

Russia Steps Up Propaganda War Amid Ukraine Tensions #russia #ukraine #propaganda
@MartinA41573803 @russian_market It is all a pretense.  They'll never go to war against Russia, such a decision requires the consent of all NATO members. And there will obviously never be such a consensus from all member states. #Ukraine
As tensions continue to flare between #Ukraine and #Russia, which has amassed at least 100K troops along Ukraine's eastern border, the U.S. continues to mull intervention, a part of which includes bolstering Ukraine's #cyberdefenses. Read more:  #NATO
