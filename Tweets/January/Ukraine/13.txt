3 days ago @SecBlinken asked for a "strong response" from #Brazil to the "#Russian aggression" in #Ukraine, and today (13) a statement by Sergei Ryabkov - that 🇷🇺can use #Venezuela &amp; #Cuba as anti-US assets - fueled 🇧🇷|ian fears that a conflict could be "exported" to its borders 
This headline gives me the chills. Especially when two opposing nuclear powers are involved. I guess that "peace dividend" from the supposed end of the Cold War has long been spent...  #Ukraine #Russia #ForeignPolicy #deterrence #peace 
@NatashaBertrand That #Putin plans to invade #Ukraine isn’t in doubt. What matters is what will be the response?

"The Honorary Chairman" of #OSCE who didn't even participate to the recent meeting, but is spinning #Minsk2:
Opinion @FT #Nato honesty on #Ukraine could avert conflict with #Russia The alliance should affirm it has no plan to accept Kyiv’s membership bid, in return for a drawdown of Moscow’s forces

Putin waited for the old Russian New Year's holidays to end tonight and then he will move apparently to occupy half of #Ukraine  as an initial stage.  #Russia 
@CSIS_Threats @SethGJones A good overview. But what I miss in this article is the fact that some Ukrainian soldiers and police officers may not fight but just sit idle or even defect to Russia. It will not be on a large scale. But it will happen. Can you take this into account too?  #Ukraine #Russia
"Ukrainians need to be in the room", so here you go. This is from 2020. It echoes what I heard from activist women across #Ukraine 2015-17 and by following them since. Especially "Most Ukrainians refuse the either/or terms of the Russia-West antagonism." 
#Europe is nearer war than it has been in 30 years, #Poland's foreign minister warned during the third round of diplomacy this week aimed at defusing tensions over #Russia's demand that #Ukraine never be allowed to join #NATO. 
@TruGeex @encyclopath @CNN But noone is putting missiles in #Ukraine. Ukraine was not joining NATO. There were no discussions about that except for putin claiming that.
Mulling the specifics of a start of a war between #russia and #Ukraine. 
@JonMaloy @benjaminhaddad At minimum, russia wants the status quo. If everyone deescalates, and everything returns to 'normal' (i.e. Donbas remains in conflict and Crimea remains under russian control), #Ukraine loses and putin gives the false appearance of concession but ultimately wins.
In #Germany @Vitaliy_Klychko is a household name. It is   sad to hear him talk about the possibility of going to war to defend #Ukraine. But the drumbeat of war in #Europe is getting louder. As a #German this feels scarily reminiscent of 1939.

@ulrichspeck It is very problematic that countries with such history as #Russia &amp; #Germany are twisting still arm of #Ukraine with #Minsk1, 2,... and worse.  And our #Honorary #Chairman of @OSCE @ikekanerva is having similar thoughts, capturing narrative right after yesterday' meeting. 🙄
Let's face it: there can be no diplomatic solution to the ongoing war in and threat to #Ukraine. #Putin has nothing to gain from that, that he doesn't already have. And by refusing to challenge Putin we have a lot more to lose.
@SethGJones takes a look over the precipice...   @csis_isp @CSIS #Ukraine #RussiaUkraine #RussiaInvadedUkraine #whatif 
@TruGeex @encyclopath @CNN Why should Putin demand anything at all? #Ukraine is a sovereign nation that can apply for membership to any organization it wishes. NATO was not even discussing Ukraine membership and in fact was telling them they are not near being ready.
#US National Security Adviser: #Russia has placed tens of thousands of its soldiers at the borders of #Ukraine..and the package of sanctions we are working on regarding Moscow is financial par excellence! Are your interferences suspicious?. 
Pondering a war between #Russia and #Ukraine. 
@TruGeex @encyclopath @CNN When were the last discussions held regarding accepting #Ukraine into NATO? When was there ever a consideration to place missiles there? Never.
Its called #Corruption in plain sight! Putler's dubious pipeline project is not going to end well for the biased German #SPD party. #NordStream2 #Europe #EU #NATO #Ukraine 
@NATO is squarely responsible for the current mess that #Ukraine finds itself in. A stupid policy of expansion without studying the security risk that are associated with it is the bedrock of the problem here. @NATO had a victors mentality to take it all, consequences are coming.
@marcorubio The old #Republican #Ukraine storyline 
@KremlinRussia_E Does Putin really think he can convince the good people of Russia that his cause is just when it comes to invading the #Ukraine? Really? That kind of brainwashing might work in China, but not in Russia! And speaking of China- Putin should think twice about #NATO
@Oceanus911 Ummm. For Democracy? To keep its word of protection they (along with RUSSIA) gave #Ukraine after they gave up their nuclear weapons during the breakup of the Soviet Union? Without helping #Ukraine, they should be  allowed to rebuild their nuclear arsenal. You OK with that?

@DoomsDayPlace @CJ66735989 @rusty_joints @MassDara @IntelCrab It's russia that is threatening to invade #Ukraine. NATO isn't attacking anyone.

#US Sullivan says they have info which suggests that #Russia is laying the groundwork to fabricate a pretext for invading #Ukraine: "We saw this playbook in 2014. They are preparing this playbook again"
@JustinTLogan Forget it. It is the West that wants #Russia to 'invade' #Ukraine. All we can expect from Russia is that she will aim devastating precision strikes at #NATO offensive weapons in her backyard, just to make a point
NATO shares intel about #Russia between allies. The US shares intel with its trusted allies. #Ukraine shares intel with its allies. Has it occured to anyone that probably very few countries share such intel with #Ireland? Because we're not #NATO and they cannot trust us. 1/2
#Russia says #Ukraine talks hit 'dead end', Poland warns of risk of war 
How do you say you don't understand the territorial ambitions of #Putin &amp; his desire to reclaim what the #USSR lost when it collapsed. If you don't include that Moscow will pay a heavy MILITARY cost for an attempt to invade #Ukraine, then Putin-just like #Xi/#CCP &amp; #Taiwan-DGAF. 
@RALee85 You need to read more Mearsheimer and Cohen. The chances of this happening is zero to nil. #Ukraine is far too complex a country for Russia to be bogged down in.
@RNCResearch Now ask about @JoeBiden and #Ukraine
#US doesn't believe #Russia "definitively decided" on #Ukraine invasion, Sullivan says - AFP

🚨🚨War is not looking good for #Ukraine. 
#Greece 🇬🇷 is the only NATO member with a negative view of the alliance  57% of Greeks view NATO negatively   Greece has also engaged cordially with #Russia 🇷🇺 in recent days, including over #Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 and #Ukraine 🇺🇦
If the #US isn't locked and loaded and has in-theater forces on stand-by, then "we're [NOT] ready either way..." ... #Ukraine #Russia 
🇺🇦🇺🇸🇷🇺🇪🇺🌍  Our latest for @GeorgetownSFS on this week’s #Ukraine talks with insights from @Jeff_J_Anderson, @AngelaStent, @jillrussia, @AmbHeffern, @kdtraveler, Amb. Kenneth Yalowitz, Theresa Sabonis-Helf, and Roger Kangas: 
We’ve seen it before. #Ukraine 
#Russia 🇷🇺's efforts to freeze NATO expansion has resulted in NATO agreeing to accept #Sweden 🇸🇪 and #Finland 🇫🇮   Russian brinkmanship in #Ukraine 🇺🇦 has disastrously failed to achieve its main goal
@UnderSecStateP Can never take #Nuland seriously either as a diplomat or a foreign policy expert. Most of this pathetic situation in #Ukraine is her own doing. #Russia should not budge an inch, if the push comes to shove, tactical nukes should be deployed by #Russia to attack #EasternEurope
Saber-rattling over #Ukraine is largely a matter of natural gas supply from Russia. Here's a primer: 
Wrapup 5-russia Says #Ukraine Talks Hit Dead End, Poland Warns Of Risk Of War #Political  
The #CIA is overseeing a secret intensive training program in the #US for elite Ukrainian special operations forces and other intelligence personnel #Ukraine #Russia 
@OBrien4sheriff And then allow #Ukraine to rebuild the nuclear defense systems which they gave up after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
In 1990, I was part of a #US and #Russia student exchange where Russian students came to school at an American Airbase for one week (#Bitburg). I take this shit serious and I remember #NATO agreeing "Not one inch east" - US #Ukraine Missiles = #CubanMissileCrisis2 #NoWar #BackOff
