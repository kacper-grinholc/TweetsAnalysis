I believe the West has suspended #Iran nuclear talks to determine the outcome of the #Ukraine crisis. If #Russia launches a military attack on Ukraine, the West will give Iran more concessions to put pressure on Russia. The fate of Vienna talks is tied to the Cold War in Ukraine.
@business It's obvious to everyone except the typical American consumer of corporate media. The United States and its NATO allies cannot wait any longer for yet another war. The U.S. and its allies are the aggressors. Let's hope they get taken down a few more notches. #Ukraine #Russia

#Germany's current share of gas in their portfolio of energy supply stands at 8.7%, out of which a third is provided by #Russia/#Ukraine, ca. 3%. Nuclear reactors will be shut down gradually. There is no such thing as an "energy extortion".

@olgatokariuk @NataliaAntonova “Glory to #Ukraine” was around at least from mid 19th Century poetry of Taras Shevchenko &amp; used by patriotic youth in Kharkiv at turn 19/20th century. Nazis wouldn’t allow its collaborators to use it, but it was used by Ukrainian nationalists who were arrested &amp; killed by Nazis.
#Russia sent its strongest signal so far that it is willing to engage with #US security proposals and reiterated that it does not want war over #Ukraine.

Russia's wide array of military options - unavailable in 2008, 2014, or 2015 - make #Ukraine difficult to defend. Ditches and trenches would be useless against a punitive air campaign, and #Russia could invade anywhere or everywhere. It makes sense for Kyiv to stay the course.

“Conflict is not inevitable,” @SecDef Lloyd Austin said. “There is still time and place for diplomacy.”  A Russian invasion of #Ukraine is not inevitable but if it does occur, it would lead to a significant number of deaths, top US military officials said. 
#OOTT #WTI #Putin's military buildup along the #Ukraine border has been a bargaining chip in his mind, but now the situation is out of his control and spiraling to the brink of a war that he didn't really want to happen. The misreading by oil traders sent oil to 7-yr highs.

I reckon #Russia will attack from several routes at once, seeking to overwhelm #Ukraine and drawing away its forces from any one point of weakness.  #Putin claims military exercises.  ANWAR #SADAT DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING BEFORE #EGYPT ATTACKED #ISRAEL IN #YOMKIPPURWAR OF 1973

Ukraine strikes major deal with the UK   The Ukrainian parliament has ratified an agreement with Britain to secure more than $2 billion in funds for the construction of missile boats &amp; the modernization of its current fleet  #Ukraine #UK #Russia

#Russia's interests in #Ukraine are plain + simple: 1️⃣ no NATO missiles etc. on its southwestern flank (indefensible) 2️⃣ no military attack on Russian speakers/ citizens in #Donbas ~~ Deal or no deal?

What You Should Really Know About #Ukraine
Australian senior analyst on Russia "they will be moving in to take #ukraine in mid February". Am I the only one who thinks that is suss, that they already know exactly when it's going to happen?? 🤔
Come get your boy @DNC #Biden #BuildBackBetter  #Russia  #Ukraine  #Trump #MAGA 
#Newsnight  They’re *still* at it. #BBC ‘journalist’ wearing revolutionary Doc Martens obsessing about a few bottles of Prosecco.  Meanwhile, record gas prices, an all-arms invasion force massing on border of #Ukraine and another horrifying child death.  #DefundTheBBC
🔥If the freedom of all those Ukrainians doesn't matter to you, the higher prices it will inflict on you should—@RepMikeRogers to @jaketapper on why @Russia attacking #Ukraine matters: "We've seen this movie before…Czechoslovakia…Hungary…Destabilizing events will affect us." 
#Russian T-80 main battle tanks and ZSU-23-4 self-propelled, radar guided anti-aircraft weapon systems (SPAAG) and troop transport on rail toward #Ukraine.   
French &amp; Russian President, Emmanuel Macron &amp; Vladimir Putin, who had a telephone call on Friday, agreed that efforts are needed to deescalate tensions in #Ukraine, #France Presse reported, citing the Elysee Palace. #NRF #AFG 
Hey @NATO Why don’t you just accept #Ukraine into #NATO today?
@charliekirk11 #Ukraine agrees with Putin and that all war threats come from the hysteria of the @JoeBiden administration and @NATO. Said by: Oleksiy Danilov, Secretary of the Defense and Security Council of Ukraine, which by the way is a pro-Western country.
Like Poroshenko before him, Zelensky understood that US/ NATO want his country #Ukraine as cannon fodder &amp; battering ram against Russia.  Expect some "scandal" discrediting him in 3, 2, 1...
Expats in #Ukraine not rushing to depart. #Russia #Putin #Zelenskiy 
If #Russia attacks through #Chernobyl, then they don't have the problem of crossing that massive river in #Ukraine - they can just enter Ukraine from behind it via #Belarus like smashing down the back door.  Look at this map. Chernobyl is top middle, just west of the river. 
@GretaThunberg perhaps you could speak to Putin about the environmental impact of a war in Europe. #Ukraine #Russian #NATO #UkraineConflict #Putin #ActOnClimate #Russia
