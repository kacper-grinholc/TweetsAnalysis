@_shireenahmed_ @NoLore And there are those who attempt to rehabilitate the image of #Stalin as once again #Putin and #Russia aim to destroy the #Ukraine|ian language, the culture and people! ü§¨
Nothing but #FAKENEWS since the #PLANDEMIC failed  #Ukraine #Russia
@woodburner123 But #Ukraine is now more important. If the Kremlin prevails there, it won‚Äôt go quiet. It will regroup and restart its geopolitical offensive...
People should keep this in mind.  Could still be a big fat nothing. Announcing the exercises with Belarus may be an off ramp. "Exercises done we are going home". #Belarus #Russia #Ukraine 
Why not tell #Putin if you invade #Ukraine is instantly admitted to NATO? What am I missing? Oh, bezillions in weapons sales, maybe.
#Afghanistan today #Ukraine tomorrow #CapitalismAndGreed

It is really hard to understand #German policy towards #Russia and the crisis over #Ukraine. What should #NATO members make of it?
@jaketapper @CNN  If you're going to report on #Ukraine, please pronounce things correctly Kiyv is not 'Kee-ehv'. The correct way to say it is 'Keev'. Like 'sleeve'. Thank you, a Ukrainian Canadian American.  üá∫üá¶üá®üá¶üá∫üá∏
Hey Russia: another ‚Äúcare package‚Äù delivered to #Ukraine w love from the UK - coming soon to a T-72 near you. üöÄüòè 
this stood out to me in @PeterBeinart's great column on #Ukraine:   what we may think of (rightly) as impossible, a State official told me in 2018 that US policy of denial in the south China sea was the *only* thing preventing China from doing exactly this  
#VladimirPutin has not a clue how the imminent invasion of #Ukraine will turn out to be the absolute worst decision he has ever made. We are with you people of #Kiev people of #Ukraine
#Schrageistschuld SHAME ON YOU! You sold your soul to #Putin and betrayed #Ukraine and the world! #StopNordStream2 
#Ukraine to deploy 150 battalions of territorial defense, - Defense Ministry
#Ukraine‚Äôs Defense Ministry said Tuesday it was speeding up efforts to form reserve battalions that would allow for the rapid deployment of 130,000 recruits to expand the country‚Äôs 246,000-strong military.
CIA and #Ukraine 
U.S. believes that Russia may use joint military exercises inside Belarus as cover for an invasion of #Ukraine from the north, per a senior State Department official. 
Will #JoeBiden be sending blankets &amp; MRE's like his boss did? #ukraine   #Russia 
Good thread on why military action against #Ukraine may be the least strategically costly option for #Russia right now. Seeing as there are military excercises planned between Russian and Belarusian forces in Feb, I‚Äôd expect an escalation to take place no sooner than next month 
‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt threatening anyone, but we are hearing threats to us,‚Äù Sergei Lavrov said. (Reuters) #ukraine
#UPDATE #URGENT #Canada   Confirmed reports of Canadian special forces arrival &amp; deployment in Ukraine.  #Canada #Ukraine #Kyiv #NATO

We've come so far in the last couple  decades. Now, we're about to test if we can ruin everything with a single swing in the wrong direction.  Just follow the progress. Where its coming from is where we should all be. #ukraine #europe #nato #eu #us #freedomofspeech #freechoice
#FactChecking remains a good practice. RAF's C-17 bound to #Ukraine was not denied German airspace. The cargo was subject to clearance that UK did not request. Please do not share fake news. The beneficiaries are obvious. 
So, after Russia takes Kiev, who will be next? #Ukraine
@GlasnostGone I think that many people in the free Western world view are now aware of the situation in Ukraine and are thinking of the soldiers who are now holding the line on a cold winter night.  #Ukraine #USA #Nato #EU @EUCouncil #Germany 
@Reuters I understand Russia has concerns around NATO, but they can't launch an attack on Ukraine for that. The UN really needs to wake up. About time! #History #Russia #Ukraine 
@skepticalhobbit @EndGameWW3 I've analyzed #Putin professionally for years. The man is extremely narcissistic with strong elements of psychopathy. He may also suffer from schizoid PD.   He doesn't care for human life beyond its effects on his ends. At all. #Russia and #Ukraine are merely ego projects for him
"Still not enough to do a full-scale invasion and sustain it but it's still a lot."  #US weighs more military support for #Ukraine to resist #Russia if it invades
