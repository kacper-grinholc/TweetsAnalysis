A bipartisan group of U.S. senators is in #Ukraine to show solidarity with the Eastern European country as it faces ongoing tension with #Russia. 
Russian forces now surround Ukraine on three sides, and Western officials fear a military operation could start as soon as this month.#Russia #Ukraine
It‚Äôs escalating further. #Ukraine is going to turn into a cluster f*** soon. 
‚ÄúA Russian invasion of #Ukraine is not impossible, as the conditions could certainly shift to lead to a different calculus for Moscow in the future.‚Äù  @eugenechausovsk in @ForeignPolicy, on #Russia‚Äôs use of force and patterns in its interventions.  
Can't go wrong with pane d'olive in a Schiava from #Ukraine  - all about the toasty STUPIDLY fruited.
As I predicted NATO will remain low, #Germany üá©üá™ declines #Ukraine'süá∫üá¶ request for defensive weapons. Moreover, üá¨üáß Royal Air force C-17 avoided Germany's air space clear message that we are not party to #Russianüá∑üá∫- #Ukraineüá∫üá¶ war Meanwhile Russia is building up in Belarus.  
Thank you @senrobportman @SenKevinCramer @SenMurphyOffice @SenatorShaheen No negotiation over Ukraine w/out #Ukraine
@AlexLuck9 This! #Baerbock got quite a few thumbs up for going to Kyiv before going to Moscow. But if you have nothing to offer, why do you go? Just to let #Ukraine know that they stand alone? What a desaster
@EndGameWW3 I guess #Russia want to turn the #Ukraine public against its government by maintaining about 100,000 forces right on Ukrainian border since last month ,what a player Putin is
#UK helping #Ukraine 
@CreativeJuice21 @ChrisMurphyCT We are concern n Pray for people of  #Ukraine, #Kashmir, #Palestinian #uighur, #Greece ...people of all conflict zones üôè.  But, for now we need to take care $28+ trillion debt, $21k+ for a family¬†/yr health coverage, declining education and infrastructure?
1. It may be too late but @POTUS @JoeBiden don't say I didn't warn you. @WHNSC @SecDef @SecBlinken @ODNIgov #Belarus #Ukraine 
Must read for anyone in a position of influence in #Germany. This is all too real. The time to stand up and help #Ukraine - with all its shortcomings - is now. 
UK leads the way.üá¨üáß EU scared of Putin.üá™üá∫ #IstandwithUkraine  #Ukraine #Russia #GBNews 
Hey, hey, Jakey Jay: How many Ukrainians did you kill today?   Trying to beat your record from the botched #AfghanistanWithdrawal?   @jakejsullivan #Ukraine  #NevilleChamberlain redux. 
@MavkaSlavka What makes you think that #Germany is helping #Russia more than #Ukraine?
NEW- Either alongside the Belarusian military or alone, Russian forces in Belarus could now complete a north-south-east-based offensive against #Ukraine. This disposition of forces is ominous.  
Ah. #Germany. Sells #Turkey stealth subs to destabilize the entire #EasternMed, and now not only refuses - but also actively hinders assistance efforts to #Ukraine. Buy a Ford, not a Benz. Shop at Trader Joe‚Äôs, not Aldi. Fly United, not Lufthansa. 
#British C17 Transport are transporting weapons to #Ukraine - and seem to avoid #German airspace ? ü§îü§îü§î Why @ABaerbock? #Baerbock #russia #Scholz #Ampel #BreakingNews #Eil 
Thank you @melaniejoly   No negotiations over #Ukraine without Ukraine 
Russia becomes more bullying&amp;assertive, iinvolving #Belarus to joint actions against #Ukraine. #EU must respond by using PeaceFaciiry to bring  tangible support for #Ukraine ASAP!  No security does not bring more security! - my point at @EP_ForeignAff exchange w @JosepBorrellF 
Operation Red Meat or Wag the Dog? #Ukraine #ukraineinvasion #arms 
@SenatorShaheen @SenMurphyOffice @SenKevinCramer @senrobportman thank you for your trip to Ukraine. No negotiations w/out Ukraine over the fate of #Ukraine
Canada sending in some SF to #Ukraine‚Ä¶ Force Multipliers  
Apropos #Germany and #Ukraine.  Can't you see that the tide is turning, Mr. Scholz? 
Berlin is offering "hydrogen diplomacy" to #Ukraine while the government digs their heels in over #Nordstream2. For fucks sake, this is adding insult to injury. As the Ukrainian side I would have walked straight out of all meetings.
Britain says it is supplying anti-tank weapons to Ukraine  #Ukraine #Britain
