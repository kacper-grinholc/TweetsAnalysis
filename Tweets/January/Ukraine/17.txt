#UK helping #Ukraine 
@CreativeJuice21 @ChrisMurphyCT We are concern n Pray for people of  #Ukraine, #Kashmir, #Palestinian #uighur, #Greece ...people of all conflict zones 🙏.  But, for now we need to take care $28+ trillion debt, $21k+ for a family /yr health coverage, declining education and infrastructure?
1. It may be too late but @POTUS @JoeBiden don't say I didn't warn you. @WHNSC @SecDef @SecBlinken @ODNIgov #Belarus #Ukraine 
Must read for anyone in a position of influence in #Germany. This is all too real. The time to stand up and help #Ukraine - with all its shortcomings - is now. 
UK leads the way.🇬🇧 EU scared of Putin.🇪🇺 #IstandwithUkraine  #Ukraine #Russia #GBNews 
Hey, hey, Jakey Jay: How many Ukrainians did you kill today?   Trying to beat your record from the botched #AfghanistanWithdrawal?   @jakejsullivan #Ukraine  #NevilleChamberlain redux. 
@MavkaSlavka What makes you think that #Germany is helping #Russia more than #Ukraine?
NEW- Either alongside the Belarusian military or alone, Russian forces in Belarus could now complete a north-south-east-based offensive against #Ukraine. This disposition of forces is ominous.  
Ah. #Germany. Sells #Turkey stealth subs to destabilize the entire #EasternMed, and now not only refuses - but also actively hinders assistance efforts to #Ukraine. Buy a Ford, not a Benz. Shop at Trader Joe’s, not Aldi. Fly United, not Lufthansa. 
#British C17 Transport are transporting weapons to #Ukraine - and seem to avoid #German airspace ? 🤔🤔🤔 Why @ABaerbock? #Baerbock #russia #Scholz #Ampel #BreakingNews #Eil 
Thank you @melaniejoly   No negotiations over #Ukraine without Ukraine 
Russia becomes more bullying&amp;assertive, iinvolving #Belarus to joint actions against #Ukraine. #EU must respond by using PeaceFaciiry to bring  tangible support for #Ukraine ASAP!  No security does not bring more security! - my point at @EP_ForeignAff exchange w @JosepBorrellF 
Operation Red Meat or Wag the Dog? #Ukraine #ukraineinvasion #arms 
@SenatorShaheen @SenMurphyOffice @SenKevinCramer @senrobportman thank you for your trip to Ukraine. No negotiations w/out Ukraine over the fate of #Ukraine
Canada sending in some SF to #Ukraine… Force Multipliers  
Apropos #Germany and #Ukraine.  Can't you see that the tide is turning, Mr. Scholz? 
Berlin is offering "hydrogen diplomacy" to #Ukraine while the government digs their heels in over #Nordstream2. For fucks sake, this is adding insult to injury. As the Ukrainian side I would have walked straight out of all meetings.
Britain says it is supplying anti-tank weapons to Ukraine  #Ukraine #Britain
