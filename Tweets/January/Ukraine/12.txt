#inflation , #Ukraine, #OmicronVarient are just three things needing leadership. But, instead, we spend our time on partisan games that divide and result in nothing gained. So happy I voted for someone who would work from the center and get things done. 
While this might all just be a very expensive PR stunt for @NATO, it may prove too costly for Moscow to back down. Once the ice on #Ukraine's rivers can hold tanks, we'll find out.

“Putin Is Not Stupid”: This Expert Spent 182 Days On The #Russia-#Ukraine Battlefields
#Putin is Threatening a #War. Are #Russians Willing to Fight It? 🤔 #Ukraine  
Here's the summation of the #NATO-#Russia dialogue over #Ukraine. It clearly failed, not because of NATO but because of Russia's unwillingness to de-escalate and withdraw 'non-starter' demands. So the ball is now firmly in #Putin's court. 
Another soldier defending #Ukraine killed by #Putin's "military exercises" 
Something wrong on the #NATO side about the #Ukraine and #Russia. #Integrity ... #bbcworldnews #PBS
In late December, I said the invasion of Ukraine would occur in 1-4 weeks. Kazakhstan threw a wrench into that prediction; I would say by no later than mid-February, Russia will start to move into Ukraine #Ukraine #Russia #NATO
“Former Ukrainian Defense M Zagorodnyuk said that, given the current momentum of supply logistics behind the lines, a Russian operation against #Ukraine now appeared inevitable. The only way an invasion doesn’t happen at this point is if someone paid for them to be halted.”
The wording of this statement seems to indicate #Russia's not only combat ready but that it's only a matter of time before the next part of reinvasion of #Ukraine starts. If #Biden has actionable intel on #Russia's next move, why not take action to prevent it from happening? 
Nato chief warns of ‘real risk of conflict’ as talks with #Russia over #Ukraine end  This is the most important news that most people aren't paying enough attention to. This is a real concern, it's not just posturing. #NATO
@joshuakeating on the history - recent, Soviet and back to the 9th century - that explains why #Putin might attack #Ukraine (again)

Amidst the debates on European strategic autonomy &amp; sovereignty, it remains to be seen if the #EU can put aside the major differences within the bloc &amp; take collective action to facilitate a #sustainable action plan to help #Ukraine, notes Rahul Kamath. 
You know what?! #NATO just needs to pledge full military support for #Ukraine, and be willing to put boots on the ground INSIDE Ukraine. - Call Putin’s bluff! - Deploy airborne in airport camps on the Western edge, from Poland down to Moldova &amp; make it clear NATO will engage.

This is increasingly the view among #Russia &amp; #Ukraine experts here- that Putin will launch some form of military action against Ukraine. I don’t think #US public is paying enough attention to the war scenario 
Cannot agree more. Guarantees for peace &amp;security in Europe were already agreed in 1975, &amp;Russia subscribed to it, too. T/problem w/that is that RF itself violates t/#SecurityGuarantees in Europe &amp;all key principles of #HelsinkiFinalAct. #Georgia🇬🇪 #Ukraine🇺🇦

@USAinUK Why do you keep peddling the #Kremlin propaganda that #Russia merely “supported separatists”. #US in 1776 were “separatists”. 2014 in east #Ukraine there were too few traitors working for the foreign power to do anything. That’s why Russians invaded, which you completely ignore.

Your daily reminder that #Ukraine 🇺🇦 has been defending Europe 🇪🇺 on its own since 2014, this is the price paid in another Ukrainian life taken whilst protecting all of us #RussiaInvadedUkraine #RussiaIsATerroristState #PutinKiller  #UkraineWillResist #УкраїнаЧинитимеОпір

In amassing military troops along the #Ukraine border,  Putin is pressing his opposition to #NATO membership for the former Soviet satellite state while burnishing his own bonafides domestically as a strong, forceful leader says our own Simon Miles.
@RepJayapal FYI: what happened in #Bolivia was a coup. What happened in #Ukraine may also be called a coup. But 1/6? An attack maybe?
If the Senate doesn’t pass the Nord Stream 2 Sanctions with 67 votes on January 14th then there will be big problems. Democrats are making dumb excuses about Iran and Climate Change. What does that have to do with Nord Stream 2? Absolutely Nothing it’s just a bad excuse. #Ukraine

@Osinttechnical This may be a war in a week. #Ukraine  #Russia #NATO #January17th
#NATO and allies are not afraid of the threat of war!  In addition, Europe and allied countries will not give up the use of force to solve the problem of many severe punishments!  First, #Russia must withdraw its ...#USA #Ukraine  
#Ukraine may again be a top headline, but it never stopped being one for the people suffering through the conflict that continues to inflict heavy humanitarian consequences on people's lives and well-being, their homes, and essential infrastructure.  
@EvelynNFarkas has a realistic view on the nature of #Russian threat in #Ukraine and the only way to confront it. #Appeasement will not work and deterrence demands preparation for war. The choice is not between peace and war. It is between deterrence now or a bigger war later 
Fascinating interview between @mattfrei and #VitalyKlitschko #c4news #Ukraine
#Ukraine I think #VitaliKlitchco and #VladimirPutin should fight it out in the boxing ring. Winner takes all!
The problem is that, whatever WE may declare, for the Kremlin, #Ukraine is not #Finland. Ukraine is #Russia, for Putin &amp; Co. In its 1994 Constitution, Moldova resolved it will not enter NATO. The undesired Russian troops and pseudo-state have since then remained on Moldovan soil. 
When everybody is talking about #Ukraine, because #Russia is messing troops near its border and everyone is predicting possible new conflict in Europe, Please don't forget that #Georgia has #Russian military bases on its territories (occupied by Russia) since 2008.
@adamcurry When card player holding nothing hand continues to bluff - this is EXACTLY type of bs speech they are giving...  Putin is calling your bullshit bluff Vicky - you have to options: 1. Fold 2. Start a nuclear war that will kill all life on the Earth  #neoconbluff #Ukraine
@mattfrei reports from #Ukraine show the determination of the nation to remain themselves.
⭕️🇺🇸#USA Embassy Kyiv,🇺🇦 #Ukraine , January 12 2022:  👉The Department of State continues to advise 🇺🇸citizens to reconsider travel to 🇺🇦 due to increased threats from #Russia.Concerning reports of further unusual 🇷🇺 military activity near 🇺🇦 borders and in occupied #Crimea…. 
Chartbook #68 Putin's Challenge to Western hegemony - the 2022 edition. @adam_tooze  on #Russia and #Ukraine    
#Europe had its chance, back in 2000s with #Moldova and #Georgia, and later on, in 2014 after #russia invaded #Ukraine. #Germany #France all prominent #EU members involved in #Minsk #Normandie etc formats with no results. #Europe chose appeasement then, must reap outcomes now 
#Russia is our enemy too, say #Muslim fighters readying for war in #Ukraine 
All this "show of reservists" in #Ukraine; they will be walked over by #Putin.  Ukraine can only stop #Russia with #Chemical or #Biological weapons.  Would not surprise me if they have a secret cache (what else offers viable defence?)  #c4news #skynews #bbcnews #lbc #itvnews
What Putin Really Wants From the #Ukraine Crisis - Jan 12 @ 2:32 PM ET [video onsite] 
#Ukraine 🇺🇦  Loud Explosions are heard near #Donetsk
Russian Deputy FM Grushko should accept that NATO has no reason to trust a state that invaded + illegally occupied a potential member, and currently has an army on said potential member's border ready to invade and illegally occupy the rest of the country. #Ukraine 
@hostess_c I do not envy you living in a country that borders Russia. Every country deserves peace and the freedom to make it's own choice about it's future. Russia under Putin is nothing but a violent bully. #Ukraine is a sovereign state and should remain so.  Good luck👍
‘“The risk of war with Ukraine is very big.” Both sides are preparing for that possibility.’ #Russia #Ukraine  from @TheEconomist 
USIP: Throughout the #Ukraine crisis, Bill Taylor, our vice president for Russia and Europe, has continued to publicly advise diplomacy, dialogue and deterrence amid the uncertainty in U.S. dealings with Moscow. We've collected his recent analysis here:  …
