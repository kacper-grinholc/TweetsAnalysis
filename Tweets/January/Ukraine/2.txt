“The civil war in #Ukraine, ongoing for eight years, is far from over,” Mr. Lavrov said. “The country’s authorities don’t intend to resolve the conflict” through diplomacy, he added. 
Neonazi units on #Ukraine are thriving. Western world has absolutely no problem in whatsoever... as long as corrupted Ukrainian gov keeps signing weapon deals with US military industrial complex everything is fine and according to democratic standars. #Biden was part of this.

“For Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kievan Rus is part proof that #Russia and #Ukraine are ‘one historical and spiritual space’… and that Ukraine has no basis to exist as a sovereign state.”🤔

  Body armor and drones will not act as speed bump against 100000 soldiers.  Land mines and heavy weapons will make more of a impact to slow a invasion.  #Ukraine
No 'Concessions' To Russia.  #Ukraine and #NATO relations shall not be a subject to talk in any form - even informal discussions - with Russia.  Instead, Russia must immediately withdraw from Crimea and East Ukraine. 
Supplying arms as a deterrent (in #Taiwan or #Ukraine) works. Bullying countries complain that such actions are “destabilizing/inflammatory” but only because they know it makes their conquest more difficult. Javelin in Ukraine’s hands is ABSOLUTELY giving #Putin second thoughts.

@washingtonpost Severe sanctions are not enough. Putin's regime will always find a way round them. We need to man up, stand firm and promise to protect Ukraine. #Ukraine

@ameyer18 #Ukraine One thing’s for sure, we all know what Putin usually resorts to when he runs out of options.  He’ll most likely create an international incident to defuse the standoff, like downing a commercial airliner in the black sea and blame it on NATO.  This is his cowardice way.

POTUS told Vlad that  “severe sanctions” if Russia moves on Ukraine.  My guess is that will be interpreted as an invitation—probably just what Vlad wanted to hear (“sanctions” conveys economic, not military, actions) probably the right policy, but best kept secret.  #Ukraine

It is difficult to know exactly what will happen if Putin invades Ukraine. Two things are certain: 1)It won’t be good; 2)If it happens, from that point forward we live in a new world, similarly to 9/11. #Ukraine
