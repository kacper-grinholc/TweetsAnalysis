Ok #badvlad you can have #Kazakhistan but not #ukraine. Now where have I read about a similar deal before? “Peace in our time” #chamberlain #Sudetenland history has a way of repeating itself is not just some old tale… it actually happens.
#Ukraine: #Biden has sold 34 Abrams tanks to #FIN marshal and these are under the boat transport to Finland today. #FIN marshal commands #Abrams panzer division in #Luhansk and they are waiting for Abrams losses in their battle scenario analysis. Abrams tanks maintained from #FIN

“#US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken on Friday accused #Russia of "gaslighting" and pushing a "false narrative" that it was under threat from #Ukraine and #NATO to justify a troop build-up near its border with the former #Soviet republic.”

@SecBlinken "The idea that 🇺🇦 is the aggressor in this situation is absurd. It’s 🇷🇺 that invaded 🇺🇦 nearly eight years ago. It’s 🇷🇺 that is the military occupier of part of 🇺🇦, in Crimea. It’s 🇷🇺 that, to this day, is fuelling a war in eastern 🇺🇦." #Blinken #Ukraine #F24
Huge news out of #Ukraine that has been overshadowed by recent events in Kazakhstan.  From 1 January, a new "national resistance" law will see the entire civilian population of Ukraine trained for war by experienced commandos &amp; combat veterans.  Basically full-scale conscription.

Is Biden offering #Putin a way to save face here? We're not going to fight an ground war in #Ukraine, so this doesn't really hurt us. And Putin definitely doesn't want to actually invade and face a prolonged insurgency.  Seems smart.

@AlexPanchenko2 No. Same thing like wanting to get rid of Cyrillic.    Why can't we keep things Ukrainian. All this switching over is inauthentic. It's reactionary to the Russians.  #Ukraine
Before doing concessions, #Biden should demand removal from #Russain troops from #Ukraine border. Based on this, negotiation could start. He should not put himself in the weak position. #Putin only understands force and hard announcements.

#NATO is up to its old tricks again predicting #Putin is going to be very naughty and invade #Ukraine. The problem remains the #Russians continue to stubbornly stay on their own side of the border. Surely, the troublemakers can't be the West and not the Ruskies after all.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a diplomatic solution to the Russian military buildup on the #Ukraine border is still possible and preferable, but that the alliance is prepared to respond forcefully to #Russian aggression. #NATO

@SecBlinken says Russia's claims that Ukraine seeking to provoke conflict: " That's like the fox saying it had to attack the henhouse because its occupants somehow pose a threat. We've seen this gaslighting before. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014." #Ukraine
Good call with @SwedishPM Magdalena Andersson to discuss #Russia's military build-up in &amp; around #Ukraine and European security. #Sweden is a valued #NATO partner and we support every nation's right to freely choose their own security arrangements: @jensstoltenberg #Diplomacy140
