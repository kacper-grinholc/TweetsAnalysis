And yes, this is a personal interpretation of what just happened on many people's January payslip. For an average income it easily means a reduction of EUR 100 per month or more. People with low incomes are excluded from the tax increase. #Poland
Called the "Polish deal', but it means tax our citizens substantially more from now on so we can pay the EU fines for being stupid enough to have a govt controlled, undemocratic court system. #Poland's govt's ignorance is now personal to many, as it hits people's wallets.
