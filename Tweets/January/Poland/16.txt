@radeksikorski #Poland should place demolition charges on the Molotov-Ribbentrop pipelines and promise to blow them if #Russia invades #Ukraine. Invasions must have consequences. If the invasion is not deterred, it will happen. Draw the line! #Deterrence is much better than war.  @anneapplebaum

@OlexijSmirnov @benjit14 @DagfinnAMork @NTenzer Wow. You are serious about that? So anyone that just happens to have a Russian passport is not allowed to vote in Ukraine? Imagine Germany would say such a thing about people who also have a passport of #Turkey or #Poland?  #Ukraine
