#Poland  The good things. The little boy, to whom hospitable Poland could only offer barbed wire and transport to the forests, has found shelter and medical care in Italy, thanks to  Red Cross and good angels. There is a chance for treatment, new prostheses and a normal life. 
Stopping the refuge from Belarus is understandable and urgent, but building a complete Iron Curtain which cuts through Europe's oldest forest and splitting animal pops, is a step too far. There are less drastic measures to tackle the influx issue. #borderwall #Poland #Bialowieza
