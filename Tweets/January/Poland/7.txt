Hello from #wroclaw #Poland . 
Unattended democracy? Yes, it's #Poland! We got your freedom back and were actually left alone with it. No watering, nothing! Only struggle for a better life still so far away, beyond our horizons. Well, that's the recipe for perfect #populism.
Wondering why democracy in Poland is crumbling? Well, next time if you plant a seed of democracy don't neglect it, if you do it will grow wild. That's nature. I think #Poland has been left unattended for years and now we're going wild. I hope some good things'l be born out of it!
