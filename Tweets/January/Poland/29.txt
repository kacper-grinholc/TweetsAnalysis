#Belarus - #Poland  Refugees are trapped on the PL/BY border. The situation of many of them is tragic. Especially on the BY side it is very difficult to organise help for them. They are hungry, cold and injured - many of them with injuries after being beaten and bitten by dogs. 
It is a duty of all Europeans to support #Poland at this time when it is suffering attacks on its borders and has to put up with delegations from Brussels that seek to trample on its sovereignty.  Prime Minister Morawiecki has received our solidarity at the #CumbreDeMadrid

@CaroRackete this forest in #Poland is not just a forest. The #Białowieża National Park on the border with #Belarus is considered the last true primeval forest in Europe. The primeval forest would be destroyed by this #EUFortress border and many rare animal species would become extinct!!

Protests are under way across #Poland after the death of a 37-year-old woman this week who was refused an #abortion, a year since the country introduced one of the most restrictive abortion laws in Europe. 
@ELuttwak True. Port security is critical for #Poland, though, especially if there is a land war. They may get so busy they have to restart the old historic crane in #Gdansk. 😉

Yes. Nazis could locate #Poland on a world map. 
#Poland has started building a nearly $400 million wall on its eastern #border—intended to block #migrants from crossing illegally. The EU calls the migrant surge a “hybrid attack” launched by Belarus. 
Really glad to see more media getting access into #Poland’s border strip, but to say this was “one of the very first trips” isn’t quite accurate. These trips have been going on since early Dec 2021, which is when I conducted my own reporting from the zone  
✅Is it time for a #European pushback? Last #century, the #USSR annexed territories from several European countries: #Finland #Germany #Poland #Romania etc. This century #Russia did just the same in #Georgia #Ukraine etc. Better for Russia not to take too many things for granted. 
#Belarusians in #Poland began to take to the streets of cities with protests. The first who came out were the residents of #Bialystok, who supported the Belarusian and #Ukrainian people and protested against possible military action by #Putin.

@jakluge Not good enough. Russia knows that any pause in NS would be temporary. #Poland should place demolition charges on the NS pipeline &amp; promise to blow them if Russia invades #Ukraine. 1. Deter Russia. 2. Teach Germans that an invasion would inconvenience them, so they should care.
