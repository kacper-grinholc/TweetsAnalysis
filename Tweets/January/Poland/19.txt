➡️ #Poland’s prime minister is set to host his #Latvian counterpart in Warsaw on Wednesday to talk about regional #security, eastern policy and #EU issues, among other topics.
It is a very wise move from Polish President Andrzej Duda to maintain close ties with China.  As a neighbor of Germany and Russia, it is wise to get connected with China. #Poland

Gdansk is a city in #Poland there is a high probability that the tagging was done there. @kwskenya and @WWF_Africa or @natgeowild can help unravel more. 
🇵🇱 Poland is building its own gas pipeline. No longer Russia's gas supplies delivered by the Kremlin through the Yamal pipeline. Baltic Pipe project linking Poland with gas fields in Norway, will shake up energy markets in central Europe. #Russia #Poland

It's being reported that #Russia may attempt to attack #Ukraine through #Belarus.  Belarus is to host Russian troops for "military drills", near both #Poland and Ukraine boarders.  The #US is concerned that Belarus plans to also host Russia's conventional and nuclear weapons.
Everyone who pontificates about #Russia's intentions in #Ukraine, please do so through the prism of #NaziGermany's intentions in #Poland or #France. Invasion &amp; subjugation is the intent. That’s been #Moscow’s point for 1000 years. #StopRussianAggression #SayNOtoPutin

Fuck #Poland.
Dzennet Dżabagi-Skibniewska's parents were the last rulers of Ingushetia, a territory in the Caucasus. When the Soviet Union forced them out, #Poland became her new home. She fought for it during #WW2. Her story has now been immortalized in a short film.
