Last month, I got access to #Poland’s border zone with #Belarus, which has been largely off limits for journalists, aid workers, and non-locals for months. Here’s my report for @ForeignPolicy about what I saw and was prevented from seeing during the visit: 
Limitless creativity -  #Metallica's Nothing Else Matters  sung by Tulia - a Polish #folk music group. The band was formed in 2017, in Szczecin, #Poland.  Three singers in the band: Dominika, Patrycja &amp; Tulia, whose name was chosen as the name of the band 
A Catholic curia in #Poland has asked for a court to determine the sexuality of the victim of a priest and whether he took “pleasure in the intimate relationship”.  Absolutely disgusting.
