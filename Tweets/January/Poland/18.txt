Hey .@BorisJohnson .@pritipatel .@ukhomeoffice   Why can we help defend #Poland's border #Ukraine's border, but we can't defend our own border ?  And then you wonder why you're on the verge of being kicked out.  #migrants
So #Poland, #Lithuania, #Latvia and #Estonia would have a choice. Retain their independence but leave #NATO or a war in which they will quickly lose their territory and suffer horrible damage and loss of life. And would NATO even manage to fight for them? 13/
I think that #Germany has already shown that it prefers a political solution because it has very little to protect itself militarily. If Germany starts to delay or waiver in it's commitment, then #NATO can't really respond. You can't fight #Russia in #Poland without Germany.12/
So with all eyes glued to #Ukraine the real target would be #NATO's eastern flank. #Poland and the #Baltic's would be presented an ultimatum "leave NATO or be quickly overrun". An al most repeat of 1939 for the Baltic states. 9/
