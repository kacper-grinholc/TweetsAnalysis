Free Elections!🇵🇱 103 years ago, the first democratic elections in independent Poland were held: universal, secret, equal, direct and proportional! For the first time, 🇵🇱👩 were able to exercise their active and passive right to 🗳️. #History #independence #Poland 
🇭🇺🇵🇱 @EU_Commission could propose freezing EU structural funds for #Hungary and #Poland before April.   The two countries have fallen foul of the EU mechanism which links the disbursement of EU funds to respect for the rule of law.

Another #woman in Poland has died because the Party orders to wait for the fetus to die in the womb. They waited for the second twin to die to terminate the #pregnancy. This is a fetish! The party finances prayers and blasphemous posters all over #Poland. 
The #NATO missile defense base in #Poland is one step closer to completion. Pentagon has said it should be operational this year. 
Along with 8 organizations, we have filed an amicus before the European Court of Human Rights to support the brave women who are seeking justice and challenging Poland’s highly restrictive abortion law  #Poland #AniJednejWięcej
10/. A year after the ruling of #Poland’s discredited Constitutional Tribunal banning access to abortion in almost all circumstances took effect, the family of Agnieszka, a 37 old woman who died after being denied an #abortion &amp; reproductive health care, have spoken out. 
And now, I've learned that another woman has died in #Poland after being denied an abortion - just yesterday...   The ruling party has blood on its hands indeed. This is their deadly policy. They chose this.
