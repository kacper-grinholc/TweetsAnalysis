"Previously known as an outspoken advocate of Israel, in 2018 Portman nevertheless turned down an Israeli award, dubbed #Israel's Nobels, in light of the Israeli army's shooting of Palestinian protesters demanding the right of return in #Gaza." 
@Pal_action Can‚Äôt believe there are so many death factories in this country aiding a murderous apartheid state like #Israel ! It really is shameful #ShutElbitDown
Understanding #antisemitism:  Those who pick on only #Israel for vaccination policies followed by all Western governments are expressing their antisemitism.  Criticism of Israeli policy that includes the other countries with the same policies is not antisemitism.   #USA #Canada

The disaster coming from the #North of #Israel will start off from the #Russia-#Ukraine-#NATO-#USA war &amp; it will work it‚Äôs way down to the #Armenia-#Turkey-#Azerbaijan war &amp; then move in #Syria &amp; from #Syria in #Israel when #Assad crosses into the #Golan‚Ä¶

@Theoneoneone11 Why pick on Israel for policies followed by all Western governments. You are not accusing Canada being undemocratic. Canadians are almost all vaccinated. How about England? Vaccinated. No you only accuse #Israel. Your statement is literally the definition of antisemitism.   Shame
Some 10,000 people in the northern town of Beit She'an will be killed in the event of a massive earthquake in Israel, according to government assessments that the mayor of the town revealed on Sunday.   #Israel | #earthquake  
More importantly, #Israel still does nothing to stop and punish Jewish terrorists. And the Israeli military regularly murders innocent Palestinians (including American citizens). Question is when will US do something about Israeli war crimes and state sponsored terrorism? 
@MattWalshBlog @cjsienna55 **  I think you've missed the whole point of the #Ukraine standoff between #Russia, #USA, #NATO &amp; #Europe.  Need to read more history books, especially about the fall of the Ottomans, WWI, WWII, creation of #Israel, the Cold War &amp; more recent wars &amp; upheavals in the #MiddleEast.
