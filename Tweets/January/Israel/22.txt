"Double refugees’: #Israel forcibly expels Palestinian families from #SheikhJarrah and demolishes their home!"  Cartoon by Carlos Latuff 
@HenMazzig Mate, I had to decide which political party to vote in the Netherlands a year ago and searched their programs about... #Israel.  And hey-hoo, too many had an opinion about #Israel. WTF?! China? Iran? Yemen? Syria? Any other country? Zilch.  It's really a disease.
40-year-old Abed Husri and his partner, 35-year-old Atef Husri, likely died of carbon dioxide poisoning from a charcoal oven that was left turned on, according to @Mdais. #Israel
The reemergence of #Islamists must be a security concern to #Israel, although even Bashir by the end of his tenure was willing to deal with Jerusalem.
Israel is enslaving Palestinians through its control of the disputed territories, said Stated Clerk Rev. Dr. J. Herbert Nelson II of the US Presbyterian Church on Monday.  @Starrlord89 reports:  #Presbyterian | #Palestinians | #Israel

Americans don’t need to “imagine this”. We remember this. We did it to indigenous Americans. #Israel has become a morally bankrupt nation of oppressors - just like us. In another 50 years they’ll be passing laws against teaching Israeli kids about any of it.

@my2centss @DanielSeidemann There was no Palestinian rule until 1990s. They are not losing any land, they're controlling more land now than ever before. A quick history lesson. This is the land of #Israel in the 9th century BCE. We occupy no land ,they do. We are where we belong , HOME ! ! !
