It would appear that @antisemitism is once again targeting another #academic who has bravely spoken out against the #Israellobby. Bet the Lobby's next step is to get pro #Israel members of the #Lords to send a letter asking for his dismissal. #FreePalestine #BDS #Labour #Corbyn
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett must resign, chanted thousands of right-wing activists as they rallied outside his Jerusalem home on Thursday night.  @tovahlazaroff reports | #Protests | #Israel
The Jewish Agency chairmanship selection committee received three recommendation letters for candidates from three coalition party heads in recent days, but none from Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.  @Gil_Hoffman reports | #Israel | #Diaspora
@Fionn_Grunspan Dolphins may figure as a component of any Military, performing simple but important underwater tasks.   A “Hamas” swimmer is a terrorist with ill-intent.   If, in fact, #Israel has #dolphins protecting her shores, well done. It’s like having an organic aquatic drone.

@ArielElyseGold The #Muslim Arabs and Catholics were in 1400 years forcing Jews from jewish land. So What ar you little girl talking about. #Israel #USA
I see #PRITIPATEL is concerned about chinese spies. Is that the same Priti Patel who jets off to #Israel for secretive meetings?
@intifada Perfect #Israel

@SillyGooseTown Yes, also, Joan Ryan of Labour took £1M from #Israel to subvert our democracy.   Why hasn't she been arrested yet? Tory AND Labour are riddled with corruption. #Starmer, #Hodge, #Sunak #Johnson are all paid by the #Israeli lobby.   Arrest them all. NOW!  #LBC #Zionism #C4News
@Samawal_LLC The Jews have returned back to the land of their ancestors, the land of Israel, from which they were expelled under certain historical circumstances, but the law does not lapse and therefore there is no "Palestinian" land occupation by the state of #Israel. (2/3)
@_Nxdin Your dad is 4000 years old? Oh, lol. You mean the current State of #Israel, not the Ancient one…  In the Middle East alone, He can compare himself similarly to #SaudiArabia, #Iraq, #Iran, #Jordan…. and on and on
Actress and model @BrookeShields planted trees in #Israel with JNF and so should you. 🇮🇱  Planting trees in Israel is a beautiful way to show you care. Help us continue to make Israel blossom. 🌳   Plant trees today:  
Why do #Zionists take themselves so damned seriously? Why do they have so much trouble processing counter-arguments, and why do they have no #senseofhumour at all?  #AntiZionism #Israel #FakeAntisemitism #ZionistBullying 
#Israel is committing crimes against #Palestinians in the #Negev region #النقب #انقذوا_النقب 
#Israel says it broke up #Iran ian spy network that recruited women  Spionieren für Iran!  
@JamesMcGuckin2 @pritipatel Can anybody list how much Johnson has had from Russians, how many Tory MPs have worked for or been funded by foreign companies, which Tory or Labour MPs have received money from Jewish sources, and especially what has @pritipatel received in payment or hospitality from #Israel
We recently brought 262 #BneiMenashe from India on aliyah, including more than 100 children.   They came here with just the suitcases they could carry. We brought them home... Let's make them feel at home here in #Israel! 
⁦@GovLarryHogan⁩ wishing that ⁦@UnfilteredOnFox⁩ #DanBongino was Governor because he wouldn’t be leading Maryland into the demise of #Israel. He wouldn’t be killing kids with the #vax, #lockdowns, #depression, #drugs, #suicide and #alcohol. He wouldn’t mandate a #jab 
So, @IainDale,  Did you speak to Joan Ryan when she took £1M from #Israel?  And she's not the only #Blairite to be on 'friendly' terms with #Israeli spy Shai Masot and the #Israeli embassy.  Are you, DALE working for #Israel?   #barrygardiner #LBC @LBC #GBNews #Traitors #SpyGate
#Israel’s fragile governing coalition faced a crisis after Bedouins staged violent protests against tree-planting by nationalists on disputed land in the #Negev. It is seen by the Bedouin as preparation for the seizure of land by #Jewish nationalists.
The Arab-Islamic party in Israel's government is using extortion to stop Israel from planting trees, not only in the West Bank/disputed territories, but even on public land in areas that have belonged to the Jewish state of #Israel since 1948.  Full story:

Semi personal, semi professional thread about a challenge I face as a historian trying to make it academia while employing the term #settler_colonoalism to Zionism  #Zionism #Israel #Palestine #AcademicTwitter 1/
#Israel's left-wing parties, Meretz and Labor, gambled their deepest principles to join a government led by a right-wing nationalist champion of settlements. Is their political bargain paying off? Are they influencers, or fig leaves? 
@haaretzcom #racism ASAP #Israel
@AriGerstman @ReelRotation27 Oh yes, many leftists do.  For example, when a self-proclaimed leftist and #HumanRights activist supports the #antisemitic #BDS movement or when demonizes #Israel by calling it an #apartheid state, accusing it of #genocide and #EthnicCleansing against Arabs, and so on.
“Foreign interference or any potential threats to our democracy” love it! Here’s what Priti did: Thirteen meetings were held in #Israel in the presence of Lord Polak, an experienced Tory Israel  lobbyist which Theresa May didn’t know about. The hypocrisy is unreal!

@AriGerstman @DeadStateTweets Let me help you.  For example, when a self-proclaimed leftist and #HumanRights activist supports the #antisemitic #BDS movement or when demonizes #Israel by calling it an #apartheid state, accusing it of #genocide and #EthnicCleansing against Arabs, and so on.  You're welcome.
The occupation forces arrest a young man on suspicion of attempting to carry out a stabbing attack near Gush Etzion.  #Apartheid #Israel is an #antisemitic state that continues to ethnically cleanse the #Semitic #indigenous #Palestinians from the land. #Zionism is #antisemitism
