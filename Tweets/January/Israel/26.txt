@Stephen46723144 @kazzacoey No #Israel has not sent the order to @Keir_Starmer yet, a bit like the #FordeReport!
The #Christian population in #Israel is increasing, and the community, by most measures, is in fact thriving.  At the end of the day, Justin #Welby’s Times op-ed was grossly #dishonest, and represents nothing but a #shameful anti-Israel #smear. 
🇵🇸s do not need guardianship or efforts to civilize them; what we need is for the world to step in and demand #Accountability. Int. Laws were created for the protection of all people, including the🇵🇸s. #Israel shouldn't be able to evade that principle &amp; with impunity, forever!✌️ 
78-year-old Palestinian-American Omar Assad, killed by Israeli soldiers, had "traumatic brain injuries...internal bleeding in his eyelids...bruises on his arms &amp; red welts on his wrists" according to autopsy. @StateDept_NEA must hold #Israel accountable!
