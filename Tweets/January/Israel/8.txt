Recently, Israel increased the number of Gazans allowed to work in Israel under “merchant permits” to 10,000, although 90% of them are not engaged in trade. If Gazans hate #IsraeliApartheid so much why do they come to work in #Israel and not in Egypt or Jordan? #Gaza #work

#Djibouti #Ethiopia #Somalia #Israel According to declassified Israeli files on Africa, Somali politicians in Somalia, sent a group of Isaaqs to Ethiopia to frame the Issas for the damage to the Andoured Railway Bridge, thus straining relations between Issa and Ethiopia. 
#Israel immediately offered to return the lands it won in 1967 (WB,Gaza,Sinai, &amp; Golan Heights) in return for a peace treaty. This offer was rejected by Arab countries in Khartoum Conf (Aug. 29- Sep. 1, 1967). Its the rejection of a Jewish state in any form that is the  problem.
Article 24 of the original PLO Charter reads: “this Organization [the PLO] does not exercise any regional sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, in the Gaza Strip or the Himmah area.” Why would #Israel control of that area make a difference to the PLO?
