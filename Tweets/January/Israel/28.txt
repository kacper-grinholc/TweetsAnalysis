7. #Honduras' potential downgrade of ties with #Israel is a legitimate concern. The goodwill of Central American countries is contingent on many factors; no ally, however small &amp; distant, should ever be taken for granted.
5. But #ElSalvador's "fall" would put #Guatemala in a vulnerable position. #Qatar's goal in this is to break #Israel's relations with its ally, and also to exert influence over the heads of state of Central American countries against #KSA, #Egypt, &amp; others and in favor of #Iran.
4. No wonder #Qatar agents of influence have worked hard to cause problems for @nayibbukele in #ElSalvador. #Honduras already has a socialist leadership that is likely independently put #Israel on the back burner if not worse. #Guatemala is not likely to budge.
I support the sentiment and I‚Äôll up the ante. #Israel was #reclaimed. She was born thousands of years ago‚Ä¶ 
3. #Israel can't be a full substitute for #US economically - and other state actors are looking to capitalize on these sensitive issues. #Turkey, #Qatar, #Russia, and especially, #China &amp; #Iran are looking to turn these countries into puppet states to be used against ISrael &amp; US.
2. #Israel made significant diplomatic inroads in #Guatemala, #Honduras, and #ElSalvador - but without the US support, the governments of Central America are facing populist pressure, foreign intervention, &amp; need to focus on addressing economic vulnerabilities.

7. #Israel's security relations with the clients of #NSO and other companies do not threaten the world. #Iran's campaign of #terror, #antisemitism, and total control does, as does #Qatar's campaign of global corruption. This #NYTimes attack is serving the interests of both.
5. The fear of #Iran's "Axis of Resistance" that now includes not only its global proxy network, but #Qatar, Muslim Brotherhood and its various branches, &amp; assorted mercenary interests &amp; fellow travelers, is that #Israel will use its might to expose their soft power takeover.
4. Such "investigations" do nothing but create momentum to isolate #Israel &amp; to pressure weak-willed #Israeli politicians to cooperate less with key allies in the region and beyond on vital security issues against legitimate threats.
#Muslims don‚Äôt have a problem with #Jews they‚Äôre Ahl al-KitƒÅb.   It‚Äôs the #Nazis of #Israel we have a problem with and their best Nazi buddies Endia.

2. You can be sure that this "investigation" is part of an organized state-backed campaign to undermine #Israel's security and diplomatic interests, relations with friendly and potentially friendly states &amp; its entire cybersecurity industry. It was never just about #NSO/#Pegasus.
1. The attack on #Israel indirectly building security &amp; diplomatic ties by having a private company (#NSO) selling surveillance software #Pegasus to client states comes at a time when #NSO is about to be sold off to a foreign buyer. Why investigate this?
