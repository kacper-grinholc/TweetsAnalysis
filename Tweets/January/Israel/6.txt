@NdlovuMerv @imshin Are you seriously advocating for mass surveillance and population control as opposed to border checkpoints entering #Israel and #Egypt surely that would make Gaza a prison which #Israel is not willing to do, you can’t treat people so inhumanely. Shame on you for suggesting this.
@IndianfootballH #India missed Tulsidas Balaram &amp; PK Banerjee(both were injured , so not selected) Otherwise it would have been impossible for #Israel defence to stop the trio of CHUNI - PK - BALARAM in the 1964 @afcasiancup  🇮🇳⚽️ PS : After that we never played with @ISRAELFA 😢 @IndianFootball
90. Assange, Snowden Russia And Israel - The Great Game #israel #uk #usa #russia #australia  Israel used Assange why are they not helping him now!? Are they scared of potential damages they did to several countries.... 
The #Netherlands will stop funding a #Palestinian civil society group outlawed as a terrorist organization by #Israel, but rejected Israel's claims about the group following its own audit 
The #dutch government has practically accepted #Israel's unfounded designation of six major #Palestinian NGOs as 'terrorist.'  via @PalestineChron
It seems that so many of those accusing @jk_rowling of antisemitism are either themselves antisemitic or rabid #Israel-haters. Funny that.
As informations suggest, it looks like  #Tigray War, #Ethiopia  relied heavily on drones from #Israel  #Iran #UAE and #China as they are trailing their heavy gun machine away from their home. #StopBombingTigray Africa is not a LAB 
Israel's military has fired missiles at sites in Gaza   #Gaza #Israel #GazaUnderAttack 
@SamRamani2 @IsraeliPM , the #Jews state was involved in this genocidal in training and providing drones under the pretext of they were to be used against LOCUST! #ISRAEl is supporting #TigrayGeoncide together with #UAE #Iran !
Thank you, Emma Watson – Palestinian rights deserve advocacy and attention. Solidarity with the people of Palestine should not be viewed as an untouchable cause, shrouded in silence. #EmmaWatson  #Israel #TheGazaYouDontSee
There's another hit piece on #AxelSpringer, a pro-#ISrael reputable German media which now owns @politico. Unless the author considers defending #Israel's right to exist a "right-wing cause", there's no excuse for the author's attack on Axel's politics.
The Israeli health ministry committee is examining the possibility of removing cannabidiol from the list of dangerous drugs.    #verde #hemp #thc #israel #drugs  
With #Israel passing a national budget for the 1st time in 2 years, ending multiple coalition collapses elections, trust in the #government rose slightly, but overall confidence in state institutions remains low, according @IDIisrael's annual survey
“Prior to the #Tigray War, #Ethiopia 🇪🇹 relied heavily on drones from #Israel 🇮🇱  Ethiopia's experience operating drones from both Israel and #Iran 🇮🇷 is exceptional”  #StopBombingTigray   @POTUS @EU_Commission @UN @G7 @NATO 
@RandPaul @tedcruz @WendyRogersAZ @Jim_Jordan @TomCottonAR JUST IN - Double vaccinated, boosted, and now 4th shot. Despite this, "Covid cases" in #Israel reach a new record high: 16,115 new cases. All vaccinated. What bullshit are you gonna say now government 
What should we think about this Palestinian liberation game that Israelis and Jews have widely condemned as immoral?  Apple:  Spotify:  YouTube:   #gamedev #gamedesign #Israel #Palestine #ethics  #indiegames 
When BDS idiots tweet their hatred for #Israel on their cellphones and tablets that are made in Israel. Btw, at least 1 out of every 6 medications in existence is developed in Israel. Make sure you inform your doctor that you refuse medical care as well. #BDSfail 
Amir Abdullahian: Israel is not in a position to carry out its threats - #status_of_jerusalem #capital_city #jerusalem #israel 
#Covid shot #4 is available in #Israel for people 60+. Among the first to get it: Knesset speaker @MKMickeyLevy, MK @NirBarkat and my dad, who said the old folks fought in line over who would get theirs first.
This is perhaps the most worrisome news of 2022. Not only the #UK maintains a #nuclear stockpile in #Cyprus the island borders #Israel which has an estimated 90 nuclear warheads. Scary to say the least. 
Once again the factions in #Gaza are reportedly placing an ultimatum for #Israel to relax restrictions on trade and reconstruction with a "deadline" for next Thursday.  Almost all of these "ultimatums" have ended with nothing, so definitely not holding my breath.
