With more and more Russians finding that McDonald‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Mac‚Äù tastes like FREEDOM, Vladimir Putin has apparently been checking out the rumor in secret.  Fun Fact: McDonald's is among the 10 largest fast food networks in Ukraine. #Russia 
@NATO perhaps it's time to have an emergency vote on making the #Ukraine a member before #Russia attacks or invades.

#Ukraine wants peace while #Russia wants respect. #NATO wants to emphasize its importance, while the #USA like the provocation. At least #Germany has sent 5,000 helmets. #UkraineConflict
"...with #Russia, as with #China, the liberal democracies have been very slow to wake up to how serious the challenge to their order and expectations has become. #Ukraine has become a test case of the willingness and capacity of #NATO and the #EU to stand up when it counts."

Ridiculous #oped  The only difference between #russia &amp; #china is that China murdered millions more of their own people than the Russia! 20 years ago, the US coined the phrase ‚Äòaxis of evil‚Äô. Guess who‚Äôs been the most evil since?
