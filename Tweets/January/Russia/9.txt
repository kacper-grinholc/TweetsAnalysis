#DonaldJTrump was and is a #RussianAsset supported by his butt buddy #VladimirPutin , Dictator of #Russia . #Putin 's Russian Intelligence Agency #FSB planted Russian Spies in the #USA and at #NATO headquarters. #DonaldTrump owes the Russians $400 Million Dollars. #GOPTraitors 
#Russia might just be guarding $KAP #uranium. At least for now. What matters is that there is now a big question mark over #Kazakhstan reliability for supplying the west with #nuclear fuel. That question mark is not going away. Smart utilities will stock up moving forward. 
#Russia may want to ensure they do not get bogged down in an insurgency within #Kazakhstan (Afghan in the 80s). If the plans for an invasion in #Ukraine are acted upon, they will struggle maintaining two supply lines at a time. The #US struggled with #Afghanistan and #Iraq.

@anders_aslund Since its actions in Transnistria 1990-91 &amp; beyond trampling the sovereignty of #Moldova, #Russia has shown it is unworthy of #NATO, &amp; doesn’t want it. Russia prefers autocracy &amp; imperialism to democracy &amp; peace. Even the “opposition” is imperialist. Naive Westerners can’t see it
In case you haven't been paying attention, #Russia used the exact same play that it used on #Ukraine in 2014, on #Kazakhstan -- protests sparking national instability / call for international peacekeeping.   Kazakhstan played right into their hands, giving up national sovereignty

#Russia ruled out any concession at talks with the United States on soaring tensions over #Ukraine as Moscow seeks a wide-ranging new security arrangement with the West but faces strong pressure to pull back troops.
Will #Russia and #China divide #Kazakhstan between them? Now that #Biden has left #Afghanistan in a hurry, #VladimirPutin and #XiJinping are free to do whatever they want in Central Asia.

📌 Great paper by Chatham House.  💰 The growth of London 🇬🇧 as a centre for financial and professional services coincided with the collapse of the USSR and the rise of post-Soviet 🇷🇺 kleptocracies in the 1990s.       #corruption #Russia #UK #AML
#arctic #methane map for the day 09.01.2022   Lots of areas with dark brown levels  No mention nowhere . As usual  Massive emissions all over #Russia also  Some coastal areas showing high readings near Yamal ..erosion?  COMPARE with 1 year ago  #ClimateCrisis #ClimateEmergency 
@nytimesworld Ukraine does not want Russia and Putin knows he can only go so far. His core paranoia is NATO #History #Russia #NATO #Ukraine 
For the US, engaging #Russia can be a smart move if it wants to focus on its long-term strategic competition with #China, opines Harsh V Pant. #IndoPacific 
#EMERCOM of #Russia calls to equip houses with fire detectors 
Ardak Bukeeva, @Forbes journalist reporting from Kazakhstan. Russian troops massacred #Kazakhstan peaceful protesters in the streets of #Almaty. Civilians were shot on sight, without any warning. #Russia framed its crackdown operation and invasion of Kazakhstan as "peacekeeping"
.⁦@SecBlinken⁩ tells @CNN's @JakeTapper that the United States is prepared to impose "massive consequences" on #Russia if it chooses to invade #Ukraine. #CNNSOTU  
.⁦@SecBlinken⁩ tells @CNN's @JakeTapper that pulling some troops back from eastern Europe and refusing to allow #Ukraine to join @NATO are not on the table in negotiations with #Russia this week. #CNNSOTU 
Ah now it makes sense #russia 
Cos, THAT, what you just said, did #Russia say to #America at THAT Table.
@olex_scherba Talking about impossible demands. #Russia #Ukraine #NATO #CSTO 
##Russia#Moscow#citieswelivedin#bunnyandbear#adventures#ourlove#US#myperson 
@cnni Just let Russia know that it has very few options after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact #History #NATO #Russia 
Once #Russia crosses over into #Ukraine no sanctions or "Massive Consequences" are going to drive them out.   Biden needs to have Russia excluded from SWIFT  (global electronic payment system) NOW  Tell Putin Russia doesn't get back in until he pulls back and stands down.
At the moment,#Azerbaijan has these elements.This means only one thing - #Baku,which did not sign an associative agreement with the European Union at one time, will in the same way build its own, special model of cooperation with #Russia, which is being created today, #USSR 2.0 
The recipe for maintaining a high degree of real sovereignty of #Azerbaijan consists of many elements. These are, first of all, a leader, a strong army and experienced special services, a powerful ally of #Russia for internal stability, as well as competent, balanced diplomacy.
Watch: Why Russian troop presence in #Kazakhstan has triggered a fresh faceoff between #US and #Russia 
@AP_Europe @AP Russia needs to build itself as an economic superpower so it can go past the paranoia around its neighbors joining NATO. But with one deranged individual at the top, is that even possible? #History #NATO #Russia 
(The Financial Times):#West treads narrow path to common ground in #Russia talks : Vladimir Putin’s red lines are expected to be rebuffed by US and European officials .. #TrendsSpy 
With #US and Russian officials meeting in Geneva and #NATO-#Russia meeting Wednesday, reposting look at Russian draft US-Russia and NATO-Russia agreements.  Many provisions clearly unacceptable. Some offer basis for negotiation ... if/if Moscow is serious.
Wow this news report took a while to get to the point that Russia is now in control of Kazakhstan. Who wants to make a bet they will soon “want” to run a vote on weather they should join #russia. History doesn’t repeat itself but it does rhyme. #Kazakhstan 
Meanwhile in #Russia... 
The #Russian defense minister underscored that his country "[has] no right to lose in this war," which he said was launched on all fronts.  #Russia
