Seeing the West and Russia cooperate on energy, climate, and cyber in the midst of a major European security crisis, with a real risk of armed conflict, is a sign that there are some functioning channels of dialogue. #NATO #Russia #Ukraine

A large scale #cyber attack on #Ukraine's government websites this morning was reportedly carried out from #Russia|n territory: 
The U.S. claimed #Russia is preparing a false-flag operation as a potential pretext to invade #Ukraine. Ukrainian military intelligence issued a similar warning and said an invasion would likely be preceded by an increase in cyber activity by Russian actors.
As things appear to be deteriorating as fast as they are, now might be a good time to look at some possible events of the near future‚Ä¶ #Russia #US #Suwalki

This is the start of an invasion. War tactics. Now the U.S. is saying R will have a False Flag event and blame Ukr, so they have an excuse to invade. Biden trying to deflect from his domestic F ups.Look, if Ukr throws a rock x the border at the R, prepare for WW3 #Russia #Ukraine
