#Russia continues old #Soviet tradition to use #airborne troops to quell domestic protests. This highly trained force is also sent to Kazakhstan. I still remember their rampage in 1991 during the fall of the Soviet Union. 
Correction: #Kazakhstan-#CSTO-#Russia: "One lesson of recent history is that once #Russia|ns are in your house, it's sometimes very difficult to get them to leave" per @SecBlinken
Some operate under the false belief that #NordStream2 is a done deal and there's nothing to be gained from #sanctions. But the fact that #Russia keeps up the blackmail is reason enough to use the pipeline as leverage. 
Alas, virtue signaling and reactionary policies have put Europe in a vulnerable dependent place that #Russia and others can exploit.

If #Russia did not send troops to #Kazakhstan they would be in violation of a treaty.  They are obligated to send forces if any member state requests them.  The idea that this is somehow an "invasion" or "Russian aggression" is a stupid, NATO, US imperialist lie.
#Russia #Appeasement #Nato could move troops away from the Russian border in exchange for Russian withdrawal from Ukraine 
US complacency in particular should be noted in terms of the rich energy and human potential in Central Asian countries on the one hand, and the threat of #Russia and #China influence on the other.
