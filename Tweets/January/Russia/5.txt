#CSTO, a security bloc dominated by #Russia has agreed to send peacekeeping forces to #Kazakhstan citing article 4 of the collective security treaty. That article is normally expected to be used in case of an external threat though. Here is what it says:
@viktopalova What is in it for Lukashenko you think?  #Kazakhstan #Belarus #Russia
‚ÄúThe #US and #Germany's top diplomats issued a joint warning to #Russia ahead of high-level security talks in #Europe next week, pledging "massive" economic consequences if Vladimir #Putin proceeds with an invasion of #Ukraine.‚Äù  
If we lived in a real world with real threats, #Russia potentially reacquiring a lengthy, flashpoint filled border with #China would be a big win for US strategists. I somehow feel like we won't go in that direction.

@dkaleniuk @OlgaNYC1211 We are able to help You, but #Kadyrov-#Russia doing #China's dirty work in #Kazakhstan is tougher nut.
He did. That's the problem. #Ablyazov has provoked #Russia by giving #Putin the argument that the #Kazakhprotests are organised from #Ukraine as a #NATO strategem against his regime. Will #Putin calm down if #Borat is silenced or will he feel freer to move on versus #Ukraine? 
Unfortunately, #Syria‚Äôs #Assad won‚Äôt come clean about his chemical weapons stockpiles, if the #USA &amp; its allies starts to put pressure on him to do so at the #UnitedNations security council #Russia &amp; #China will veto it and shield #Assad from any pressure.

They didn‚Äôt deliberate that long in the Kremlin before imposing on #Kazakhstan ‚Äúbrotherly assistance‚Äù in the usual form -  sending military forces. This is the risk every country runs if it is in any alliance with #Russia - Moscow may invade you at the first opportunity. 
Russia engineered uprising in Kazakhstan AND sent her own ‚Äúcivilians‚Äù to destroy buildings and harm police forces in Kazakhstan.  Then Tokayev ‚Äúasked for Russia‚Äôs help‚Äù as if ‚ÄúKazakhstan is being attacked by a foreign state‚Äù. Tokayev is Russian terrorist.  #Kazakhstan #Russia

.@TokayevKZ appealed to the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a military alliance of #Russia, Belarus, Armenia, #Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, asking to assist Kazakhstan in overcoming the ‚Äúterrorist threat‚Äù!This is TREASON! The regime gives our country to #Putin 
.@GOP .@HouseGOP .@SenateGOP  100 GOP members of Congress were involved in PLANNING the Jan 6 #Insurrection  And the TRUTH is ALL coming out  How many of you are planning an unscheduled trip to #Russia ?  #GOPSeditiousTraitors
@ADoolotkeldieva After #Putin's lawless #Russia prooves to be an unfilled economical #potemkinvillage &amp; bait for us within #EU, it may be tough for #Kremlin to see the joke to be played on them by #China.  Everybody in #Kremlin: "nah, I am here only to steal my part".  #Navalny: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Uprisings will reach #Russia in the end to @nseskuria 
#Kazakhstan‚Äôs president requests #CSTO assistance in overcoming terrorist threat  Will "fighting terrorism" serve as an excuse for #Russia to intervene ? In past events in #Kyrgyzstan and #Armenia, it didn't despite calls to do so
@BernieSpofforth The gov can say what tgey want however the public do not have to comply.  #Italy üáÆüáπ will make her voice heard soon. History proves tyranny is always followed by mass public gathering leading to revolutions &amp; changed systems #russia #germany
An example of how #inflation can lead to #socialunrest. (which continues at the time writing)  Did you that Khazaktsan mines produce 40% (!) of world mine-based #Uranium?  #Russia warns against any #foreign influence / intervention following these events.‚Ä¶

#ElizavetaPetrovna died #OnThisDay in 1762, 40 years after coming to power in a coup d'√©tat; she dismissed the French ambassador La Ch√©tardie for describing her as "abandoned to voluptuous lethargy" but she was far from the worst ruler in #Russia's history  
@The_NewArab it is also governed by the #P5 ... the #UK #USA #France #Russia &amp; #China whom are the worlds biggest arms dealers, entailing an absolute conflict of interests ... how does one facilitate peace and security by profiting from weapons of war
#Putin's #Russia's #strategy in one sentence?  Everybody in #Kremlin: "nah, I am here just to steal my share..."
@EndGameWW3 #Russia has a hard choice to make. #Ukraine or #Kazakhstan. If they delay an invasion of Ukraine beyond this winter, they'll need 3x as many troops and will take parabolic casualties.   Kudos to he who set the uprising in Kazakhstan. Stuck it in and broke it off in Putin's rear.
The #Moscow police were instructed to detain everyone who comes out into the city center with any symbols of #Kazakhstan.  #Russia #Putin #Nazarbaev #Dictator #EAEU #CSTO
So #Kazakhstan President requested, and apparently received, #Russia Army help to deal with what SO FAR looks like to be a genuine civil uprising without obvious foreign and/or military involvement. At least it looks like it from afar. Smells like #Belarus ü§î
