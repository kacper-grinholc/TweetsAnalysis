Fascinating. Read the @nytimes, then @AP_Politics, then @RT_com. #nocomment #russia #UkraineCrisis
Biden threatens Putin with personal sanctions over Ukraine  Laughable! What's sanctions to a self-sufficient #Putin? He's not your #African rulers who can't sustain themselves at home. Putin and #Russia don't need America to exist and prosper.
@CBCNews It's said #sanctions may not work because much of Europe depends on #Russia oil. What if there was an "Energy East" #pipeline to deliver #Alberta oil to refineries in Atlantic Canada that could supply Europe?
#Putin believes #Ukraine should be within #Russia "sphere of influence". The question is who determines the sphere #Ukraine should be in,an insecure little pr--k,wanting back the #Soviet Union,with "Small Man Syndrome" or 40M #Ukrainians who don`t give a f-ck about what he wants? 
Stock investors' nerves tested by #inflation, #omicron, #Russia. 
CEOs of #Italy‚Äôs largest companies including Pirelli, Generali &amp; UniCredit are due to have a video meeting with Putin on Wednesday to discuss economic ties, even as #Europe and #USA threaten to impose punishing sanctions on #Russia if it invades #Ukraine.
But US media &amp; politicians care so much about Ukraine right?  #ukraine #russia 
Oh yes, she did just say that!!   Great ‚Å¶@LibDems‚Å© spokesperson for Foreign Affairs.   ‚Å¶@LaylaMoran‚Å© ‚Å¶@trussliz‚Å© #Ukraine #Russia #Breaking 
NOVOSIBIRSK | #Belugaüê≥#3 provided #avgeeks in #Russia with this wonderful night-time display as it took off for its first transport mission delivering aüöÅfrom @Airbus via #Siberia to Kobe #Japan just before Christmas. Thanks to Sergey Kazakov for this spectacular pic! üê≥‚úàÔ∏è 
Ukrainians are going to discover in the event of war with #Russia that the West has manipulated them for a proxy war. #NATO will not fight for #Ukraine and the Ukies need to come to their senses and find a negotiated solution with the Russians.  
#Russia has the military capability to destroy any military production site that delivers weapons to #Ukraine!  I think this warning is enough for some... #NATO
Of course.   @TheDemocrats are united in their visceral hatred of #Russia, a bunch of warmongers since Truman. 
@IainSim55659177 Its false flags aimed to drag #Russia into a conflict that they can blame Russia for. Russia will not invade Ukraine but will defend the people of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions if attacked by #Ukraine
@Channel4News @mattfrei #Russia also needs to pull out of the #Crimea and #Donbass regions #RussiaUkraine
There you go #Russia's weak spot sanctioning #SWIFT and they're straight blackmailing with cutting off #gas. Imagine one gives Putler's mafia terror state another sabotaging gaspipeline. Not! #NordStream2 #fossilfuels #NATO #Germany #Europe #Ukraine 
U.S. Reduces Kyiv Embassy Staff, Weighs Sending Troops to Region as Tensions Mount with #Russia | Democracy Now!
.@JohnKerry‚Å©, fmr SoS, said at the time that ‚Å¶@MittRomney‚Å©‚Äôs opinion regarding #Russia was a "preposterous notion," &amp; also a fmr SoS ‚Å¶@Madeleine‚Å© Albright said‚Ä¶(he) had "little understanding of what is actually going on in the 21st c." 
Great read to get an idea of what is going on with #Russia #Ukraine.  
I hope #Russia don‚Äôt deploy cake. I don‚Äôt know if the @RoyalMarines and @BritishArmy have a strategy for ambush by cake. 
#Putin was ‚ÄòPlaying Poker' but... - Ukrainian service members unload a shipment of military aid delivered as part of the #UnitedStates of #America's security assistance to Ukraine, at the #Boryspil Int. Airport outside #Kyiv, #Ukraine ! #UkraineConflict #Russia #Kremlin #JoeBiden 
#Newsnight #BorisLies Johnson has brought UK and  position of Primeminster into disrepute and needs to go ASAP !!  #PartyGate   He can't represent us on World Stage and be taken seriously by World Leaders #Ukraine #NATO #Russia
The West fears #Russia is about to attack #Ukraine. But that's not the way #Russians are seeing it on #TV.  
If the government can't control it, they ban it... üòë #Russia #cryptocurrency #Bitcoin #bitcoinnews 
I just published Will Putin Start World War Three?  #Putin #UkraineConflict #Russia
Question then will be: will #Russia take yes for an answer on negotiating with #US and #NATO on arms control, transparency and risk reduction measures?  Or will Kremlin insist on demands (such as NATO forswearing further enlargement) that Russian officials know are non-starters?
A great example of ideology becoming master of the facts, when it ought to be a slave. A thing all too common these days. #Russia #USA #Ukraine #Socialism #AuthLeft 
It is both striking and revealing that politicians and media, with some notable exceptions, only discuss possibilities of #Russian - #Ukrainian war and not how to resolve conflict between #Russia &amp; #Ukraine and civil war in #Donbas peacefully.   #UkraineConflict #RussiaUkraine
¬´DPR militia vows "corresponding response" if Ukraine's army engages in 'acts of aggression'¬ª #Ukraine #Russia
