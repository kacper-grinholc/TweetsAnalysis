Most talk is coming from #NATO nations, and #Ukraine. But Lavrov and the rest of #Russia seem to be quiet, all that they have stated is that their demands were not met.
‚Äúseldom has the difference between a country‚Äôs interests and those of its leader been so stark.‚Äù #Russia
These documents were referenced today by #Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov @mfa_russia ‚Äî
I don't know if this video is real but if so it is terrifying  #Ukraine #Russia #UK #USA #NATO 
‚Äú#Kremlin offers frosty response to Blinken letter as world waits for #Putin‚Äôs next move‚Äù  In #Russia in January, frosty is all they got.  &lt;rimshot&gt;  Nah, no link.
Also the OSCE 2010 Astana Declaration, which affirmed ‚ÄúEach participating State will respect the rights of all others‚Ä¶ They will not strengthen their security at the expense of the security of other States.‚Äù #Russia deserves security  
#Russia is being oddly quiet right now. Building up to the US response they were making countless statements everyday on their demands. This somewhat concerns me especially when combined with reporting of medical assets moving to the border with #Ukraine
Seventy-seven years ago today the #Russian army liberated the #Nazi concentration and extermination camp at #Auschwitz. Today both #Tory and #Labour politicians are backing neo-nazis in #Ukraine and talking up war with #Russia. It's a funny old world. üòê #NoToWar

How #Russia Has Increased Its #Military Buildup Around #Ukraine 
@TilmanWinkler @AukeHoekstra Yes, that's a provocative statement - because it has some truth to it. #Russia has now amassed the better half of its armed forces around #Ukraine - and Germany's 5k helmets + opposing a Baltic state to send (German made) weapons to Ukraine is encouraging #Putin. Sorry.

Has there been any legitimate conversation about increasing the military budget to meet the apparent need required for Great Power Competition? #Russia #Ukraine #China #Taiwan @RepElaineLuria wrote a paper about it.  Let‚Äôs do something along the lines of that.  Build the Navy.
Are the #politicians repeating #history? It looks like! Russia feels that the West is pointing the big #guns in front of their porch. It's very close that #Russia &amp; it's #allies will enter into a #war which could spill over to the rest of #Europe.
#China cautions #US over standoff with #Russia 
The #USA does not have any right to threaten #NordStream2 - This is business between #Europa &amp; #Russia. The #EU has to wake up &amp; deny the #US any influence. All the USA wants is to become the sole supplier of #LPG to Europa &amp; continue to terrorise Europe.
I don‚Äôt think The Religious Right realizes that #Russia is basically an atheist country. üòú #DeadlineWH 
#China‚Äôs response to #America‚Äôs call to back it over #Russia‚Äôs #Ukraine ‚Äòaggression‚Äô is telling 
A Russian invasion is virtually certain once the ground freezes, Biden said to Zelensky. Kyiv could be ‚Äúsacked," Russian forces may attempt to occupy it, ‚Äúprepare for impact‚Äù, @POTUS said. NATO forces moving troops, equipment into place. Financial sanctions will cripple #Russia.
#Breaking #Biden told #Ukrainian president in phone call that "#Russia's invasion of #Ukraine is now almost certain and #Russia will attack once ground freezes and #Kiev needs to "prepare for impact".

Omits that Zelensky asked Biden to "tone down the messaging" (that is, tone down the "#Russia will imminently invade #Ukraine " propaganda. 
The #UnitedStates and #NATO respectively submitted written replies to #Russia on security issues. Russian officials said that the relevant reply is not satisfactory to Russia and will not be accepted by the Russian side.
Bad news from Central Asia #Tajikistan &amp; #Kyrgyzstan/#Qyrqyzstan had a small clashes in border areas &amp; it‚Äôs 2nd clashes between this 2 neighborhood of #China /#Afghanistan &amp; #Russia s ally‚Äôs!

Alright, let‚Äôs say #Russia doesn‚Äôt go the whole nine yards and launch a ground offensive against #Ukraine   Well, @ianbremmer told me President Putin still has plenty of options up his sleeve to further de-stabilise the situation 
Shame that will live on,  #Germany is used to that.  #Ukraine #Russia

@TilmanWinkler @AukeHoekstra Certainly #Putin has completely subverted Germany's energy supply/politics as a part of his scheme to re-create a Great #Russia. So dropping NS2 is a must. Btw, in case of Russian aggression could Germany nationalize Gazprom?
#Breaking: Reports that Biden told #Ukraine‚Äôs President during their phone call today, that an invasion from #Russia is nearly certain and added that Kyiv, Ukraine‚Äôs capital could be ‚Äúsmacked‚Äù.
#US has requested open U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday on "#Russia‚Äôs threatening behaviour against #Ukraine and the build-up of Russian troops on Ukraine‚Äôs borders and in #Belarus"
