@business It's obvious to everyone except the typical American consumer of corporate media. The United States and its NATO allies cannot wait any longer for yet another war. The U.S. and its allies are the aggressors. Let's hope they get taken down a few more notches. #Ukraine #Russia

@RepSpanberger I fully support a full military alliance with Ukraine and immediate membership of Ukraine to NATO. Any US service person that is a Ukraninan national should be allowed to take leave, serve in Ukraine's military. #Ukraine  #UkraineConflict  #NATO  #Russia  #Putin  #
West has not addressed 🇷🇺#Russia's concerns over the 1997 oral agreement. {No expansion, deployment of offensive weapons near borders and returning #NATO "military capabilities/infrastructure" to Warsaw Pact period}.  And so, armed with blood for the wounded, it's ✔, ✔ and ✔. 
High prices have discouraged the buying of spot volumes from Russia, with buyers instead tapping stored gas in Europe, where storage levels have fallen below their five-year average. #Russia #Europe #naturalGas
.@steven_pifer cautions against applying sanctions to #Russia too soon, arguing that too much preemptive action would be discounted by the Russians in their cost analysis of entering #Ukraine militarily. 
Isn't it possible people in #Kiev have a better understanding than those in #WashingtonDC? People at the sharp end usually have. Any case,who can blame #Ukraine,exSoviet republic,for acting with extreme circumspection.Even if (or perhaps because) #Russia is massed on the border

Amrullah Saleh after returning from a trip to #Russia says: NATO turned its back on Afghanistan &amp; plunged #Afg  into a new geopolitical game. The absence of the West &amp; Western institutions is in the interest of all the people of the country. Has the game entered a new stage? #NRF 
Slow/mixed messages from Berlin has created skepticism about the response should #Russia pursue an expanded conflict in #Ukraine. Thinking through this @LianaFix and I offer a few recommendations for DC, Berlin, and Brussels.  @gmfus 1/4
Timing impeccable. Russia headed for Ukraine and soviet era borders, nordstream2 completion, the olympics - then China suddenly starts talking russian! #nato #Russia #ukraine 
What is the difference between PRC economic coercion against #Lithuania, and #USA sanctions against #Cuba, #Iran, #Afghanistan, #Russia?  Does China get off the hook by declaring their actions against #Lithuania to be sanctions?

To all of the #Russia apologists such as #TuckerCarlson : this isn't a game of Risk®. You don't get to move your little army pieces onto two sides of a country and then plan to attack. And since #Ukraine President says that he knows Russia better than us, fine. You're on your own

President Vladimir #Putin of #Russia has deployed the troops &amp; military hardware needed to invade all of #Ukraine, the #Pentagon said on Friday, painting a grim picture of a tense situation &amp; warning that it is leading to uncharted territory.  #Diplomacy140
What is the matter with #Zelensky in his quest to calm the #Ukraine economy he is minimizing the risk and potential of the dark lord of #Russia. Shameful.
“#Nato has not caused this crisis and is not planning to attack anybody. Nato cannot do anything on its side to de-escalate. We should not take any expensive steps so they end up with something they did not have before.” #Estonia #Russia #Ukraine 🇪🇪🇷🇺🇺🇦 
@BeauTFC Have you looked at the U.S track record for the last 70 years? You act like the US intel agencies and U.S. officials and politicians have any credibility when their actions for decades prove they do not!  #UkraineConflict #Russia

@Russian_Council #Putin . It‘s up for him to decide! So your question has only one possible answer. Maybe #China is pulling the strings in the background but still, Putin is the one who would have to decide for #Russia
