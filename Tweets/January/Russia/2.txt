Belarus is unlikely to see nuclear weapons. Its leader is unstable and there’s really no need from a Russian military sense. #Russia 
”Western officials and defense experts are growing more convinced of the closer [#China-#Russia] relationship based on recent economic alliances, military exercises and joint defense development, as well as…public statements from government leaders.” 
#BREAKING 🚨 A #cyber attack – possibly by #China or #Russia – hit the academic arm of the #UK's Ministry of Defence and had a "significant" impact
#Ukraine #Russia Russia ‘very likely’ to invade Ukraine without ‘enormous sanctions’ – Schiff: * House intelligence chair: invasion might draw Nato closer  * Sanctions must be ‘at level Russia has never seen’ to deter Putin  Russia is “very likely”… 
@AmaranthaPharr @GameKin13870705 book loving schoolteacher? where?? #russia
@RepAdamSchiff every country #Putin says country x can't be a member of @NATO should be the day that country becomes a member. #Russia should have been excommunicated for #Crimean. Putin's motivation is simple, he's bored. He has unlimited power &amp; more money than he can spend.
Important field development in #Syria:  •Contrary to the many other reports about an #Iranian drawdown of presence in central Syria/Damascus.  •?Related to #Russia’s passivity towards persistent #Israeli air raids? 
Police murder in Belarus ❗️ In #Belarus police killed a man in front of his mother. Accusation: he had been drinking champagne &amp; eating tangerines outside the house. #Lukashenko|s killers in uniform beat him up. He leaves behind a 5-year-old daughter.  Nightmare #Russia #Putin 
So much for western propaganda: "#Russia invasion of #Ukraine is a distraction from its domestic problems"  #McFaul  
Presidents Putin and Erdogan held a phone conversation on Sunday #Russia #Turkey  
Russian jets bomb rebel-held Idlib in Syria, witnesses say #Esta #Syria #Russia #Idlib  
@UncvrngTheTruth @bblock29 And there’s more current examples that would be more effective. #China is making independent journalism a crime in #HongKong. Guess the @GOP wants to be China. Or #Russia where #Putin just murders them. #FightFascism #EndTheGOPToSaveUsAll #GOPGenocide #GOP4Communism

@jeremynewberger No way these ppl would dream of staging a coup in #Russia, #China, #NorthKorea, #Iran, #SaudiArabia. Would take more balls than they can muster or manufacture.  Here we let the coup leaders tweet, make speeches and enjoy the freedoms they’re trying to destroy for the rest of US.
