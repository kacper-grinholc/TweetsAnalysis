#USA #ForeignPolicy For years they have to impose sanctions on “#Russia if it invades #Ukraine. Failed. They speak now of serious costs if Moscow rejects "the offer of dialogue". After #Biden's election, they have lost diplomats and ministers.#Trump smile

#LizTruss speaks of #Ukraine invasion &amp; warns #Russia’s oligarchs won’t be immune to sanctions. Dysfunctional moral compass! It would be fair first to punish #Saudis over #JamalKhashoggi murder &amp;  911 and #UK + #US tycoons for unwarranted invasion of #Iraq #Politics 
#Russia and the US have the twin tasks of preventing an escalation in #Ukraine as well as negotiating a new #European security architecture that would be more stable than the one that has existed since the 1990s, says @niveditakapoor.

@foxnation Who is Wendy Deng? She has been suspected of being a foreign agent for China &amp; #Russia. Rupert #Murdoch was married to Deng for 14 years. After the divorce, she is said to have begun dating #Putin.
Joe Biden has shown the world what a senile old man he is, he's now about to engage in a war with #Russia. There is no doubt Donald Trump will be back, granted we don't have a nuclear holocaust. 
Meanwhile #Russia is busy stoking the flames very chance they get. 
@JeremyVineOn5 Rubbish, the only hostile forces in #Euorpe is #NATO, #UK &amp; the #US. #Russia as already reported it doesn't intend to invade #Ukraine. Even #Ukraine itself have said to tone down the rhetoric.😐 
Economy of U.S. 14 times the size of #Russia. We will be able to restore military equipment sooner. It's undiplomatic to say it, but #Putin's #Russia is really a pip-squeak nation with a few nukes left over from the #SovietUnion

The U.S. has no strategic interest in #UKRAINE. It is not in our interests to defend it or sanction #Russia, which will only help #China. We should support #NATO which has jurisdiction over this issue.
