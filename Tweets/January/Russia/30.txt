@foxnation Who is Wendy Deng? She has been suspected of being a foreign agent for China &amp; #Russia. Rupert #Murdoch was married to Deng for 14 years. After the divorce, she is said to have begun dating #Putin.
Joe Biden has shown the world what a senile old man he is, he's now about to engage in a war with #Russia. There is no doubt Donald Trump will be back, granted we don't have a nuclear holocaust. 
Meanwhile #Russia is busy stoking the flames very chance they get. 
@JeremyVineOn5 Rubbish, the only hostile forces in #Euorpe is #NATO, #UK &amp; the #US. #Russia as already reported it doesn't intend to invade #Ukraine. Even #Ukraine itself have said to tone down the rhetoric.üòê 
Economy of U.S. 14 times the size of #Russia. We will be able to restore military equipment sooner. It's undiplomatic to say it, but #Putin's #Russia is really a pip-squeak nation with a few nukes left over from the #SovietUnion
