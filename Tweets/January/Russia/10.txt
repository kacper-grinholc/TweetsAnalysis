This illustrates how strategic #Belarus and #Ukraine are in the evident new cold war. We are watching you closely Mr #Putin #Russia #NATO 
#Ukraine's army are prepared to defend if #Russia invades
The US is preparing to respond immediately to a Russian invasion of Ukraine, with financial, technological and military sanctions that would stymie Moscow‚Äôs ability to continue to function normally on the international stage.  #russia #ukraine #us 
@SecBlinken Imagine #Russia being member of #EU and #NATO in 2050. Visionary politicians are needed to write history and create the path.
@TatAtfender The problem is that #Germany ignores its historical responsibility to #Ukraine (6.5 million dead &amp; 42% of infrastructure destroyed), &amp; operates as if it only has historical responsibility to #Russia, &amp; works in the #Kremlin ‚Äòs interests.

#Russia:  We are not interested to occupy Ukraine. But NATO is a no go.  USA:  Maybe we can trust you-maybe not...  NATO:  We are on duty for Ukraine...  Ukraine:  Better blow up the globe before Russia enters. 
If this is not an endorsement, I don't know what is. #Ukraine is openly supporting @SenTedCruz's Nord Stream 2 bill to #sanction the pipeline, which can still be used as leverage to curtail' #Russia's #energy blackmail of #Europe &amp; rising regional aggression.

It's true #Blinken is less obviously absurd than #Pompeo but that's a desperately low bar isn't it. Both of them pretty much talk the same drivel about #Russia planning to dominate the world. They must assume every other country wants to be permanently at war as does the U.S.
