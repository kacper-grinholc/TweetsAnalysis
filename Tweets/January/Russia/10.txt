Leon Panetta is mistaken, Russia has paid a price and is struggling with the sanctions. Putin is just huffing and puffing and he knows that if he invades Ukraine, Russia will sink into an economic disaster that will have Russian people rioting. #Russia #FoxNews
@DeputySecState Just so we have it on the record, you would have no problem whatsoever if #Russia built a military base the size of Gitmo complete with ballistic missiles in Cuba, correct? If so, great. If not, then stop trying to pull #Ukraine into @NATO.  cc: @GeorgeSzamuely

Transcript of Deputy Secretary #Sherman’s briefing following today’s #SSD talks with #Russia. 
@zerohedge #Ukraine is a western problem due to @NATO expansion eastward poking #Russia Balance of power politics disrespected: expensive agencies &amp;military we pay for are mishandled by elected officials who treat a 19th century problem with 21st century liberal imperialism @RussianEmbassy
This illustrates how strategic #Belarus and #Ukraine are in the evident new cold war. We are watching you closely Mr #Putin #Russia #NATO 
#Ukraine's army are prepared to defend if #Russia invades
The US is preparing to respond immediately to a Russian invasion of Ukraine, with financial, technological and military sanctions that would stymie Moscow’s ability to continue to function normally on the international stage.  #russia #ukraine #us 
@SecBlinken Imagine #Russia being member of #EU and #NATO in 2050. Visionary politicians are needed to write history and create the path.
@TatAtfender The problem is that #Germany ignores its historical responsibility to #Ukraine (6.5 million dead &amp; 42% of infrastructure destroyed), &amp; operates as if it only has historical responsibility to #Russia, &amp; works in the #Kremlin ‘s interests.

@jensstoltenberg @StefanishynaO let’s just wait for Russia&amp;USA to agree in Switzerland the future of Ukraine,while Ukraine itself as well as any European powers or the EU itself are excluded from a decision that will affect the future of Europe!That relevant you all are after all! #ukraine #russia #usa #europe
#Russia:  We are not interested to occupy Ukraine. But NATO is a no go.  USA:  Maybe we can trust you-maybe not...  NATO:  We are on duty for Ukraine...  Ukraine:  Better blow up the globe before Russia enters. 
If this is not an endorsement, I don't know what is. #Ukraine is openly supporting @SenTedCruz's Nord Stream 2 bill to #sanction the pipeline, which can still be used as leverage to curtail' #Russia's #energy blackmail of #Europe &amp; rising regional aggression. 
#Daraa governorate, southern #Syria, has been witnessing great security chaos despite the reconciliations and the government forces’ complete control of the governorate, amid daily killings. #Russia  
Russia: we are not preparing to, and have no intentions to, invade #Ukraine 🤷🏻‍♂️  Also #Russia: concede to our demands or else we'll continue not preparing to invade Ukraine 🤪

It's true #Blinken is less obviously absurd than #Pompeo but that's a desperately low bar isn't it. Both of them pretty much talk the same drivel about #Russia planning to dominate the world. They must assume every other country wants to be permanently at war as does the U.S.
