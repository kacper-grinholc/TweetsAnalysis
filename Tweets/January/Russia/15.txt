The #Pentagon says it has credible information indicating that #Russia is planning a false flag operation. In other words—Russia may be trying to create a pretext to justify invading #Ukraine.
Reports: Pro-#Russia militants "release toxic ammonia" in #Donbas, provoking fears over false flag / pretext for Russian invasion of #Ukraine. 
120k troops won’t get the Red Army to L’viv let alone Kiev. Ukraine is a huge country, with a professional western trained army and brand spanking new sophisticated weapons. U.K. and U.S special forces are already in Ukraine, Putin won’t risk humiliation #Russia #Ukraine #War

@if_mota #Finland has strong cultural connections to #Russia while #Sweden has had a very bitter historical conflict with #Russia. It's unlikely that bringing these countries into NATO is going to be a positive outcome the region's #geopolitics but it might deter #Russia to an extent.
Down with putin and yes that's putin Sweetcorn in a dump #Putin #Russia #Ukraine 
So, #Russia has no right to have own sphere of influence, but it's ok for #US. Well, I think this is a thing of the past. Russia won't be like it was 1990's when they lost sphere of influence and US used such weakness to bring their influence without being challenged. 
While I totally understand the #Sweden 🇸🇪 &amp; #Finland 🇫🇮 desire to join NATO, their integration would bring the West closer to a war a/st #Russia 🇷🇺. RUS has few connections to the Baltic (Kaliningrad &amp; St.Petersburg) and a NATO-dominated Baltic would be almost intolerable to RUS. 
@thehill @jakejsullivan What kind of sense does it make for the USA to acquiesce to #NATO ally #Germany depending on energy from #Russia?!  The Biden Administration makes Jimmy Carter look smart

Residents in #Ukraine should question their leadership why Ukraine was absent, not invited. The answer is simple: #NATO, #US, #Russia knows that Ukraine is just a geopolitical tool in that struggle. Ukraine doesn't decide anything in this context. #Zelensky will be briefed.

#Russia is about to invade #Ukraine. Sleepy Joe is napping and the UN and #NATO  is useless. #Putin knows POTUS is weak and lacks support of the American people and the world.
#Putin presents a profound threat to peace in #Europe as 'drumbeat of war' sounds on #Russia #Ukraine border, says @usosce  For some the prospect &amp; war itself are too good an opportunity to maintain their self-serving, crooked and criminal status quo ante 
@samova_risa @TomDionneCarro2 @vicktop55 #Russia has provided the western powers w/ detailed information on exactly why it requires them to agree a new security arrangement for #Europe.  There is no way bringing the West to its senses in this way can be any sort of defeat in my view.  This is a significant step forward.
@StateDept @SecBlinken @JoeBiden must stop appeasing the #Rissian dictator and start acting against him. @JakeSullivan46's insanity "we will support #Ukraine after #Russia attacks it" is a losing proposition. Too little too late.
In light of current events over #Ukraine &amp; #Taiwan, time 2 rethink American grand strategy.  Going neo-Nixonian would be smart...  See my @amconmag piece.  #China #Russia #SinoRussianAxis

@WhitleyStrieber So what happens when #Russia roll the tanks into #Ukraine ? I don’t see #Nato doing anything. How can you go to war with a nuclear armed country? What would you say. Ok we fight, not the face not the face. Sanctions and false promises by the West I say. A shame, Putin knows this

@MichaelGStefany @abdujalil I think somebody from DC owns an apology to #Russia for saying that once Russians are invited, they rarely leave. Hint: #Blinken. I bet US intelligence about Russia prepares to invade by any days is also one of the imaginations like Blinken have stated.
“#Canadian Foreign Minister, Melanie Joly will visit #Kyiv next week to reaffirm support for #Ukrainian sovereignty and reinforce efforts to deter "aggressive actions" by #Russia, Ottawa said on Saturday.”

Good thread about #Ukraine #Russia #Belarus 
After two rounds of talks with @NATO, #Russia has not committed to de-escalation at the #Ukrainian border. In a recent #PSBigPicture, @carlbildt, @JeffDSachs, and more assessed the prospects for a diplomatic resolution of the latest Russia-#Ukraine crisis. 
They are also loyal to #Russia. They should GO there! 
Worth noting the fairly threatening language from 🇷🇺 at @OSCE talks in #Vienna. It talks about taking “necessary measures” if its different demands are not meet within a reasonable time period.: @carlbildt #Diplomacy140 #OSCE #Russia #Ukraine #EuropeanSecurity #Kyev #Moscow #US

2 points: 1. #Ukraine has been far less alarmist re supposed #Russia invasion than #US intel, @NATO  etc &amp; remains so.  2. @SkyNews should not be in business of stoking war fears over #Ukraine - almost as tho hoping for what would be catastrophe, tragedy for all 
🇺🇦 #Ukraine 🇩🇪 #Germany 🇷🇺 #Russia  The state-owned Ukrainian energy company Naftogaz has warned against putting the German-Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline into operation. For Ukraine, it is a question of national security, Naftogaz boss Jurij Vitrenko explains in the
Is 🇷🇺 starting to build up a pretext for another invasion of 🇺🇦? There is ample reason to be on the alert. An atmosphere of tension is anyhow explicitly part of the 🇷🇺 playbook in this crisis.: @carlbildt #Diplomacy140 #Russia #Ukraine #Kiev #Moscow 
Tough following #Washington's orders. So much easier to buy #gas from #Russia. Let's think of it as #Putin's sanctions on the West. 
#Greece claimed victory in the mixed team air pistol category at the International #Shooting Sport Federation 10m Grand Prix in #Ruse, defeating a #Russia team composed of two medallists from @Tokyo2020   @ISSF_Shooting #Olympics
#Russia is attempting to forcefully drag #Ukraine into the Darkness of Authoritarianism at the moment at the same time China also planning to drag Taiwan by force into the Darkness. Afghanistan was forced into the Darkness last year #RussiaInvadedUkraine

#US official: “#Russia has already prepositioned a group of operatives to conduct a false-flag operation in eastern #Ukraine. The operatives are trained in urban warfare &amp; in using explosives to carry out acts of sabotage against own Russia’s proxy-forces” @margbrennan #falseflag 
@Notdonejr Since the first day I started on Twitter. There are increasingly more fake accounts and I read how most are BOTS from #China or #Russia. They also interject into conversations trying to start arguments. Take a close look next time you read a news story.

It’s possible that ⁦@FinlandinEU⁩ and ⁦@SwedenUN⁩ just stopped #Putin #russia from invading ⁦@Ukraine⁩ &amp; starting war in #europe 👏🏻🤗😘 ⁦@AnnLinde⁩ ⁦@niinisto⁩ (or forced him to plan a bigger one 😒) “Joining NATO Is Up to Us” 
@lukeharding1968 It's great we also so have Brits fuelling conflict with #nuclear #Russia. Thanks again Luke. 
#Russian foreign minsiter Lavrov warns #Sweden and #Finland, “If they enter an alliance (NATO) that disrespects Russian sovereignty we will react” #NATO #Russia
It is well known that in today’s world, #Russia presents an authoritarian model, where a strongman dominates the state.   But there is a less-noticed aspect that @phildorroll seems to nail here: it is also a model where religion serves the strongman. 
A Moscow court on Saturday remanded in custody three more suspected members of the ransomware crime group REvil over illegal trafficking of funds, a day after Russia claimed it had dismantled the group at the request of the United States.  #news #Russia   
This time “I think the gloves should come off.”By that I mean we must provide the offensive lethal assistance necessary for #Ukraine to repel #Russia from its territory. The #BudapestMemoradum requires this of the nuke powers(Fr &amp;China in separate docs).

We certainly should. Those who've challenged #Russia live (or die) to Regret it. 
The talks about #Russia and #Ukraine should have ended in Paris. #FoodieDiplomacy

It’s amazing that the media are so consumed with the #Russia #Ukraine border when we have an open southern border that isn’t even on their radar.

And what has #Putin to offer? NOTHING. #Putin is  a souless devil in a dead end. #Russia is #Doomed 
Looks like engineering equipment on a heavy equipment trailer. Equipment like this supports sustaining combat operations. Important for a potential incursion into Ukraine. #Russia #RussianBear 
When it comes to #Russia, Professor @mkimmage knows what he is talking about. He is a renowned expert on the country.
