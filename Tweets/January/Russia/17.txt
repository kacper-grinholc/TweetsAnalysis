Instead of issue a retraction and correction to the misreporting on #Russia's disinformation campaign targeting Senator Cotton, #Greenland, and #Trump, journalists are "adding for context". That's how they get away with being wrong on major issues without ever admitting it. 
Well, the Anglosphere are trying to have a shooting war w #Russia. Not to say you tuck tail on #Ukraine 🇺🇦 but you kind of have to w Biden having sh*t the bed on Afghanistan.  And #HunterBiden’s laptop tells us just how much blackmail Putin can put into ppl’s hands here if so… 
@seanyzf750 @BLSchmitt @handelsblatt #Russia has moved more troops to approximately 130 km from the #Russian-#Ukraine border as a contingency against a full scale attack by #Ukrainian forces on the autonomy-seeking republics of SE Ukraine.  This fact is ever excluded by the group-thought induced myopia of the West.
According to @AFP Ukraine has evidence that Russia is behind these attacks (honestly no surprise there..)  Only time will tell if this is an opening salvo in a new war or something else. 3/ #OSINT #CyberAttack #Russia

If #Russia will invade #Ukraine, any weapons that UK, US, Canada or Baltic nations supply or sell won't help #Ukraine much. It's the reality that Western leaders know well. Even Ukrainians know about it. It's a scare tactics to scare Kremlin. They are just taking notes &amp; laugh.

@swimmerbr78 @DonaldJTrumpJr @FBI HELL YES! They have no accountability. They let Hillary Clinton go- she was guilty as hell- and everyone knows! They blamed Trump for things Democrats are doing. They are evil. #Russia #Jan6 #Dossier #China
@veitdengler There was fine balance with the #Ukraine being a non-aligned state, enjoying good relationships with #Russia and the #EU. The EU was messed it up by associating the Ukraine.
No, but I’m sure you can do so from #Russia  #GQP 
A #US and #Russia war is nothing more than the guaranteed end to life on earth as we know. Nothing justifies this.
No credible deterrence by the West against #Russia beyond stern warnings. To quote Shakespeare ‘…full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.’ 
U.S. National Security Advisor Jake #Sullivan has stated that #Washington is ready whether #Russia decides to take the path of diplomacy or to invade #Ukraine. Follow @Defcon_Level  Read more:

Given reports of huge #Russian military movements towards #Ukraine , including 1/3 to 1/2 of #army battalion tactical groups, is #Russia exposed on other fronts? Could the US, #NATO , or other US allies stage exercises to distract #Moscow and complicate #Kremlin planning?  1/2
This feels like reading a history book “Germany shocked the world in Poland with all their advanced weapons and tactics we didn’t know about”  This is going to be a bad February, on all fronts. #Ukraine #Omicron #NATO #Russia 
No huh huh.., #russia   #uutisvahti

@wernerkeil @AlanAbdo13 @JukkaPSeppl #Russia The people of Crimea voted in 2014 with a 97% vote for integration of the region into the Russian Federation with an 83% voter turnout. There was no invasion.
Scholz and Sánchez call for #Russia to lower the tension in #Ukraine. The German chancellor, during his visit to La Moncloa, warns Putin that "a military aggression would bring serious consequences"  
The German government should be ashamed of itself. Cowardly doesn't even come close. #Ukraine #Russia 
Vladimir Putin Is Not the Neville Chamberlain the US/NATO Is Looking For by Thomas Knapp @thomaslknapp #Russia #Putin #NATO #Ukraine   
@amanpour @n_roettgen Even the foreign @CNN realises, that the new German government does not have a united answer to #Putin and his aggression.   Sad 😢   #Russia #PutinatWar
@I_Katchanovski If this is a legit info that West no longer will consider to cut off #Russia from #SWIFT system, I bet radicals and many politicians in #Ukraine and in #US will be very disappointed. They don't realize Europe relies on Russian gas. US can't &amp; won't provide gas for EU as a back up
@GermanyDiplo @ABaerbock @DmytroKuleba Ask #Ukraine to commit to #MinskAgreement that #Germany #France and #Russia facilitated. That would defuse the "situation" ie civil war that lasts longer than #WWII already!
Have you studied “the purges of Stalin” during WW2? The scale &amp; brutality of this violence is almost beyond imagination. Listen to “Inside the Gulag” #moonrise [PODCAST] Ep 4 by @washingtonpost @lily_cunningham   #history #Russia #SovietUnion #USSR
@BBCNews @LBC I am so pleased you have continued to educate me about how rubbish #BorisJohnson is. As I wasn’t really interested in developing situation in the #Ukraine and that #Europe #Nato is pretty close to war with #Russia? Or is that a #conspiracy theory?
At this time going to #Russia is wrong! Find an excuse and postpone your meeting. If you do so, the world will understand that #Persian culture is against killing innocent peoples and racism. Sometimes a single action means more than thousand of promises! #RussianColonialism
