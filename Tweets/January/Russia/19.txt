#Biden predicts #Russia 'will move in' to #Ukraine, but says 'minor incursion' may prompt discussion over consequences. ➡️ Depends on what you call a minor border adjustment - stopping at the Dneiper or the Dneister?
The West has never forgiven #Russia for 1917. They have aimed to break it apart only if they could. This constant war posturing from the West needs to stop. NATO thinks #Russia is stupid to buy their ‘we are a defensive alliance’ spiel.
Will Putin risk it all to invade #Ukraine? What practical steps can #NATO, #US and the #UN execute should #Russia invade the Ukraine?

Ukraine tension: Biden says he thinks Putin will 'move in'  #Ukraine #Russia #JoeBiden #VladimirPutin #NATO #UkraineCrisis #UkraineInvasion
Biden has predicted Putin will "move in" on #Ukraine. The severity of Western sanctions will depend on what #Russia's invasion looks like. "It's one thing if it's a minor incursion,” he said. 
Tonight on FISM News: 4 #GOP states completely recover from #pandemic job losses, the #WhiteHouse says #Russia may invade #Ukraine at any point, and a pastor's lost #Bible leads to its finder's salvation. 
It is never great when the #US President has to clarify that he did not in fact mean to give a green light for #Russia to invade a neighbouring country. 
It seems that #US nor #EU wouldn't impose sanctions before any invasions by #Russia. During #Poroshenko presidency, #Ukraine was looking for any reasons to push for sanctions against #Moscow. Seems #Zelensky is not creative in those terms. Copycat old policies. 
@LindseyGrahamSC #Biden remarks on #Ukraine expose #US hypocrisy in that region since US secret meeting with #Russia in #Geneva things are becoming worse in that region from #Belarus border crisis to Ukraine, Kazakhstan etc. My advice to #Kiev don't rely on US 100% they will betray you.

Biden expects #VladimirPutin will invade #Ukraine, delivering a grim assessment of the inability of USA &amp; its European allies to persuade #Russia's leader NOT to send troops ACROSS the border. 100,000+ Russian troops have been @ Ukraine border for months. 
“I think what you’re going to see is that #Russia will be held accountable if it invades, and it depends on what it does,” @POTUS said. “It’s one thing if it’s a minor incursion, and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do, et cetera.” #Ukraine  🧐 
Why is #Biden so soft on #Russia
“#Russia maintained a tough posture Wednesday amid the tensions over its troop buildup near #Ukraine, with a top diplomat warning that #Moscow will accept nothing less but “watertight” #US guarantees precluding #NATO’s expansion to #Ukraine.”⁦⁦ 
#Russia has forces deployed in #Syria and in #Kazakhstan, somewhat stretching their military, which is still mostly equipment from the 1980s and #Ukraine is a major regional economic and military power, this isn't bunch of guerillas such as they've faced in #Afghanistan &amp; Syria.

#Biden is apparently considering cutting off #Russia's banks from dealing in US dollars. Russia currently pays for 36% of its imports in dollars (and receives dollars for 56% of its exports). Ironically, the dollar is especially important for Russia's trade with #China.  
Bottom line on US response to #Russia as they get set to wage war on #Ukraine. US public is tired of losing wars. Wont put a single boot on the ground in #Ukraine even if asked. And #Putin doesnt give a rats ass about #sanctions. #Biden is weaker than #Obama was on Syria.
@Going on @BNCNews with @nayyeroar now to explain -/ any sized incursion into #Ukraine should bring harsh consequences for #Russia. #Germany and other allies know Putin won’t stop at one bite of the Ukrainian apple, or at Ukraine alone.
That is roughly twice the territory of the current #DNR and #LNR republics and #Russia firmly establishing its presence there would more convincingly serve the purpose of preventing #Ukraine entering #NATO but not decisively destroying Ukrainian statehood. #minorincursion

Anyone else concerned about Biden being in charge of the #US during a potential #Russia-#Ukraine war? #WorldWatch
#Russia accuses UK of fuelling Ukraine crisis by sending missiles  [ungated version] The spin in this is absurd - Ukraine is not a 'top tier army' but that doesn't lessen the seriousness of this situation. 🙁 
1. #Russia and #Ukraine  2. #China and #Taiwan  Doesn't look too good.
Our most recent @PerchSpectives #podcast with @m_suchkov is already one of our most-listened to yet after just a few days. If you haven't listened yet, now is a good time to expand your horizon with a perspective from Moscow! #geopolitics #ukraine #russia 
#Russia can’t have troops on the inside of its borders but the U.S. can have 1,000 military bases around the world…   #Ukraine   Do you not see anything wrong with this picture @UN?
Reality hits West, they cannot stop #Russia
#WWIII #Russia #Moscow #Christ warns "WAR would come from afar out of the NORTH. A whirlwind and IN the whirlwind a FIRE infolding itself.   But this is a prophesy or a VISION of WAR and not of a common whirlwind.   This is a PROPHESY of a WAR coming fro…

@geoallison #Putin may take #Ukraine easily but #Russian won't be able to hold it for years. In payback #Russia would loose substantial about of territory. Oil and gas resources.

I then headed to ship #2 to find a crew from #Burma, #Philippines, #Russia, &amp; #Ukraine. The 3rd ship had an all-Filipino crew. On the 4th ship, I met Zhang again (see last Oct). He's the Chinese 2O who was so glad to receive Bible study mat'ls saying they were good for his heart.

Solidarity with #Ukraine against #Russia’s bullying &amp; intimidation. West &amp; East keep out of Ukraine! #HandsOffUkraine 
@business @Quicktake It's amazing, newspapers in USA and EU telling the same all day, #Russia invades Ucrania, news from russia media and their leaders saying  not.  It's seems that #USA want a war.
All this Cold War hysteria about #Russia invading #Ukraine reminds me of the film "Reds"--it's about one thing only, "profits." Pipelines and profits. Period.
