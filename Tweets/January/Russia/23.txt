Just remember. If the world goes tits up with #Russia invading #Ukraine it's #JeremyCorbyn fault.... according to #TheTories
After the build up of #Military forces along the Borders over several months, what are the chances of #Russia and #Ukraine having a full scale #conflict? IMHO - very unlikely.
#Ukraine's #Zelensky asks why the West is waiting to impose tougher measures against #Russia.  #RussiaUkraine #UkraineCrisis 
Q. Is that what you are expecting to happen, an invasion?    @DominicRaab: "I think there is a very significant risk of it."  #Russia  #Ukraine 
The Internet is a place of true democracy (unless you live in #China, or Vladimir #Putin‚Äôs #Russia).
With the absolute best will in the world you're either deluded or an idiot if you think we could ever influence #Germany here.  David Cameron couldn't even wring very modest concessions from #Mutti, no way we ever get them to actively support #Ukraine &amp; go against #Russia 
In 40+ yrs, @SenSanders has soul out to #Russia, done nothing for #American people, gone from welfare to 1%, owning 4  luxury mansions in 2 states &amp; was overwhelmingly rejected in 2 National Elections by  real #Democrats   #JoeBiden #KamalaHarris #TeamJoe #KHive #DNC
2 days late to this (you know, news, idiot admirals etc.), but: always follow @celiabelin and @BlochAgneska for #FrenchFridaysüá´üá∑‚ÄºÔ∏è  This week: #Russia, #Ukraine, &amp; THAT @EmmanuelMacron speech üëá 
The head of the #GermanNavy has resigned over controversial comments he made over #Ukraine. #KayAchimSch√∂nbach said the idea that #Russia wanted to invade Ukraine was nonsense. He added...all #PresidentVladimirPutin wanted was respect.#BBCNews #Attention‚ùî
29 thousand #Crimea ‚ÄòYouth Army‚Äô recruits taught to hate #Ukraine and be ready to die for #Russia  #Yunarmia #militarization #WarCrimes   
The #Chinese embassy in #Russia has called a #provocation and a #fake the publication in #Bloomberg on the alleged request of Xi #Jinping to #Putin not to "attack #Ukraine " during the #Olympics. More #fakenews than this?  A competition to see who invents it more #dangerous? 
There needs to be a stop to the arms build-up and Canada especially Western Canada should not get involved ... #abdulhadihamid #ukraine #russia #UkraineCrisis 
@ABCWorldNews If she don‚Äôt have a seat. Let‚Äôs not act like @POTUS is doing this. These choices are on #Russia The focus has been deescalation. #Putin is still going to push.
