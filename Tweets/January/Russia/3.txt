Given timing, have to ask, is this #China, and #Russia, trying to nobble response from #USA, #UK, #Europe, before they both move to annex other countries, like #Taiwan, and #Ukraine&gt;&gt;&gt; a nuclear response would be most unwelcome, to their aggression??

@RutheniaRus @withMEAA Ironic that @abcnews , funded by #Australian taxpayers, loaded with far left journalists, was in the 1980s coordinating closely with the communist #USSR, &amp; now projects the lies of a warmongering far right &amp; dictatorial #Russia. They are actually encouraging war against #Ukraine.
@BurggrabenH In simple terms... #Russia, despite being granted higher allocation, has been unable to produce the #oil; world has underinvested for 10 years, due to woke investors. Consumption of fuel has not fallen quickly, as deluded investors, the woke community, assumed&gt;&gt; oil WILL RISE.
The Russian president is not just coming to New Delhi to maintain the ‘special, privileged strategic partnership’, but to also deepen bilateral relations, writes @jonandan. #Russia #PutininIndia 
@duzdanisaq The 44-day war took place because #Russia allowed it.  In #SouthCaucasus, it is playing with the various unresolved conflicts to continue to maintain its presence there. If it was really ally with #Armenia, it would have recognized the self-proclaimed Republic of #Artsakh.
@PoliticusSarah @politicususa Tweeting is a free instrument  to spread lies by #MarjorieTaylorGreene. She is lying for selfish political benefits. #Russia intelligence agencies used social media to attack #USA Presidential Election. Social media must be responsible to the security of people.

@edwardlucas is a well known British expert on #Russia; a policy maker with strong views. Yet the article he recommends covers ground not seen much in the media. P.s: Enjoyed our Thanksgiving dinner in #London! 
@Biz_Ukraine_Mag Extraordinary that @nfergus , in lockstep with the majority of duped intellectually challenged &amp; #Moscow influenced media believes that “#Russia backed separatists” control the #Donbas region. It casts a pall over the rest of this analysis, which in the main is quite sound.
#China, #France, #Russia, the #UK and the #US have agreed that a nuclear war "cannot be won and must never be fought."  Not just #nuclearwar, no one wins any war. The people and the economy always lose.

Jean-Luc Melenchon, a far-left political leader in #France now wants France 🇫🇷 to leave @NATO.   Not only has #Russia 🇷🇺 been supporting far-right politicians in France but also far-left.  So typical Moscow’s strategy for polarizing Europe further ... 
Meanwhile, in #Russia... 🇷🇺 
Pledges from #Russia &amp; #CommunistChina are useless. 
Harsh V Pant: For all the testiness on #IndoPacific &amp; emergence of #Quad, Moscow values a partner such as New Delhi that has demonstrated its ability to maintain its strategic space by standing up to #China &amp; challenge the US on defence ties with #Russia. 
The United States 🇺🇸 is threatening extensive sanctions on #Russia 🇷🇺 if it invades #Ukraine 🇺🇦   The US should also design a clear policy for a small-scale military escalation in eastern Ukraine short of a country-wide invasion  This is a more likely outcome
Ironically, #Russia is the largest land mass in the world, and a failed state. #PutinIsAKiller's twisting in the wind shows that every day. #RussiaInvadedUkraine #MH17 #CrimeaIsUkraine #PS752
