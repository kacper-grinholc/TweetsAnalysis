#China #Russia #Europe Chinese Foreign Minister Wang #Yi : "As long as China and Russia are together, the international order will not be violated, justice in the world will not collapse and hegemonism will not win". 
Happy new year to all twiterlandia. #NewYear #travel #tourism #russia 
between #russia and #europe #nato it will be all about #ukraine and more especially the parts that have gas or are a port like #mariupol #2022 - will we be outsmarted by #putin or stand our line for #democracy 
#Finland's President @Niinisto stressed that #Russia's ultimatums to #USA and @NATO were "in conflict with the European security order" and asserted that "patience, responsibility, and dialogue" were the "only roads forward." | #NATO #Europe #s√§kpol=#turpo  
@GOP Are you moving the party home to #Russia?
Modern day gas chambers ie Drones and concentration camps are being built. Mass rape, killing/shooting and arrest just on the basis of being Tigrawei|ti‚Äî while the UN/NATO is allowing #China #UAE #Iran #Turkey #Russia and Shame on #Israel to take part in these Mass atrocities‚ÄºÔ∏è
May the new year brings back all the loved ones involuntarily disappeared by their governments. #EnforcedDisappearances are fast becoming a pandemic. Thoughts with all the families waiting for their loved ones. #Pakistan #Bangladesh #India #Russia #China 
A graphic to understand the many vehicles in the Russian military. Not tough to find but tough to ID. #Russia #russianbear 
@SputnikInt Well of course #Ukraine closed its ports to #Russia "unilaterally."  How else would it be done?
#Russia "Superpower, as Izvestia noted three decades ago, is a hard habit to kick, and it is incumbent on the West to disabuse Mr. Putin of his imperial illusions" @nytopinion
Perfect match with #Finnish president Sauli @niinisto 's New Years speech today. Listing to both Finnish and Swedish versions it became clear to me that if #Russia gets more involved in #Ukraine, #Finnland will need to seek for #Nato membership. üëâ #consequences 
#Russia and #Belarus plan to enhance defense cooperation amid tensions with the West

Because the Syrian government did not trust the army officers, it intended to form small groups led by leaders of the Military Security Service. #Syria #Daraa #Russia  
Happy New Year for real!!!!  #Russia #Ukraine #Prediction #2022NewYear #NewYear2022 #pug #pugs 
They are wondering whether I came from #Greece  to #Armenia via Belgrade #Serbia #Poland and #Russia ? 
Notice the wording.  #Ukraine is the clear victim here, but in this article it is Ukraine that has "further strained relations" with #Russia by closing its ports to its aggressor, like Ukraine has done something wrong.  Language matters. #Putin

#REDSQUARE #Moscow #Russia ##NYE2021  Due to the massive issue with #Covid they didn‚Äôt have a big party, just a firework display to mark the #NewYear2022  But in #Vladivostok (3 &amp; 4 pic) they had a full on party üòÄ 
Happy New Year!  Today is #SportySaturday for my #streetview spottings and I found Trud Stadium in #Irkutsk #Russia Plenty of photos of soccer matches, &amp; car shows But I loved that it turned into an outdoor ice rink with speed skating in winter.  #speedskate 
With less than two weeks to go before senior US and Russian officials are to meet in Geneva, the chasm is deep and the prospect of finding an exit to the crisis faces no shortage of complications.  #UnitedStates #Russia
