Oh of course - #TFG ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£ü§£ü§£ "What's happening with #Russia and #Ukraine would never have happened under the #Trump administration. Not even a possibility," Trump said.
üéß The #EU has urged #Russia to deescalate tensions over #Ukraine, warning Moscow it would face "massive" consequences if it attacked Ukraine. NATO also said it was sending ships, fighter jets to eastern Europe. @yanpal7 joins with the latest analysis:  
It seems like some US parts of the NRF were set from notice to move (NTM) 10 days to 5 days. That's no deployment. Most likely just a precaution, and more importantly a sign to #Russia that #NATO is ready &amp; willing to use forces at its disposal, if necessary.  #Ukraine #Belarus 
Is a mutually acceptable deal with #Russia possible, and what would it have to include?¬†@CFTNI hosted @Gottemoeller and Thomas Pickering in an expert panel to discuss. #Ukraine #NATO

Wait till this hits and #Russia bans #cryptocurrencies. Goodbye #Bitcoin and many more.   Treasury, the Fed or Congress can ban crypto in the US, too. You'll hear a lot of talk about dangers of crypto, but rarely hear about the legislative bodies that can ban it in the US. 
This is a sole tweet in my feed that talks about a real, not a hypothetical invasion and names names &amp; reveals implications of mil supplies. But the news will go unnoticed &amp; the responsible will go unpunished/unsanctioned (cuz we all know why) only to keep the focus on #Russia
