@emilyhorne46 @AVindman @POTUS Russia is so concerned about its border  - which do NOT have NATO troops on them - that he’s put 100,000 troops on his.   Who’s the aggressor?  #Russia #UkraineWillResist
#Russia sounds a lot like Donald #Trump today, who for years sounded like the #GOP who sounds like Russia much of the time. "Stop blaming us for planning to do things we're not!" Then they do those things, claim it didn't happen, or was provoked.
Fresh ideas like this are always welcome, but I'm afraid that sanctioning #Russia's path to a green economy will only worry fringe figures like Chubais. For Putin and his close circle, it doesn't matter, as they won't be around anymore when fossil demand actually starts dropping. 
MNNA decision likely also constitutes an attempt by 🇺🇸 to gain Qatari favor (largest global LNG producers) in bid to secure gas supply to Europe in event of a war between #Russia Ukraine. This is because conflict between two nations is expected to prompt global gas shortages
