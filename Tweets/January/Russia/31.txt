#Russia sounds a lot like Donald #Trump today, who for years sounded like the #GOP who sounds like Russia much of the time. "Stop blaming us for planning to do things we're not!" Then they do those things, claim it didn't happen, or was provoked.
Fresh ideas like this are always welcome, but I'm afraid that sanctioning #Russia's path to a green economy will only worry fringe figures like Chubais. For Putin and his close circle, it doesn't matter, as they won't be around anymore when fossil demand actually starts dropping.

Thisüëá #Putin doesn‚Äôt fear #NATO troops on Russian borders, he fears an increasing number of increasingly functional &amp; prosperous democratic post-Soviet states on Russia‚Äôs borders. He‚Äôd rather keep #Ukraine &amp; #Belarus down rather than build #Russia up. Sticks to what he knows.

#Kaliningrad is a vital Russian #military province that is physically separated from #Russia (surrounded by #Belarus, #Lithuania, #Poland, and the #BalticSea). What happens if Belarus were to turn away from Russia and towards the #EU?
