@LT3000Lyall @hkuppy Way more complex imho.

Today it is #Christmas in #Russia and this is how #Putin likes to celebrate it. #Almaty  #Kazakhstan 
Feels like 1989 again:   #SovietUnion #Kazakhstan #KazakhstanProtest #news #russia
Central Asia: geopolitics.  Moscow-led security bloc sends troops to Kazakhstan #nzz #gas #oil #China #Russia #EU  
@ichbinilya @leonidragozin Yes, as expected neither #Kazakshtan cares for it's bloody #kleptocracy.  Naturally #Putin's #Russia sees something like this being aimed against itself.  #Shalket was very scary for also Putin as current Russia merely cares about protecting his #kleptocracy.
‚Äú#Ukraine and the #EuropeanUnion are standing shoulder to shoulder in counteracting the aggressive policy of #Russia.‚Äù said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba
@evgen_valyaev @McFaul Micheal,  I must disgree with you on this one.  How often France intervenes in Africa without a UN mandate? Did the UN issue mandates for all US interventions in Latin America and Carribean? And then let's forego the Iraq War for now.  #Kazakhstan #CSTO #Russia
@hockeytammo @wajeeh_ul_din @CIA Because it is in the playbook the Americans are using. This piece might help you sort it out. #Kazakhstan #Russia #NATO #USA #RandThinkTank #ColorRevolution #Coup #CentralAsia

@MarinaPurkiss And yet tve #Kazakhstan Gov‚Äôt asked #Russia and #Putin for help.. Why
Another post-Soviet ‚Äòruler for life‚Äô faces upheaval, as enormous protests sweep Kazakhstan  #Kazakhstan #KazakhstanProtest #Kazak #Russia
Interesting #Thread re. #Russia-#Kazakhstan 
Imagine Pro-Russian sites calling the Russian troops landing in #Kazakhstan "Peace Keepers".. They are an occupying force, just like their presence in #Syria.   #Russia #Occupation

@UN #Security_Council #America #Russia #Syria must develop a binding UN plan for the exit of foreign countries and the return of the Syrians to choose who governs them and punish Bashar as a war criminal

Well, you know, it was the people who rebelled against the dictatorship #Kazakhstan #Russia 
The #US cautioned troops from #Russia who are deployed to #Kazakhstan against taking control of the state's institutions, and said the world would be watching for any potential rights violations.

In general, being a member of the #CSTO and the Organization of #Turkic States at the same time is no good. It‚Äôs going to change. The Caucasus with its #Turkic whatever belongs to #Russia .
Pay attention to what #Oil is doing.#Energy #geopolitics     #Russia #Ukraine #Kazakhstan #China #Europe
@Klllmanjaro @KorstenKristjan @DrRadchenko And we all know who is the real power in #SCO. Especially as warring #Putin makes #Russia more &amp; more dependent on #China. I am sure they will wait with a polite smile, this time at least. Anyway, messy confrontation - easier to deal with Russia later &amp; let it do dirty work now.
You deal with #Russia over #Ukraine &amp; #Caucasus 
If #Kazakhstan President Tokaev survives current unrest after he‚Äôs received #Russia‚Äôs help, #Moscow‚Äôs strategic posture in #CentralAsia would become stronger. If Tokaev falls Putin will be confronted with double whammy of Ukraine/Kazakhstan synergetic syndrome

In recent times, the killing of people, who were in the ranks of the opposition and reconciled with the government forces in #Daraa, south #Syria, has been repeated. #Russia  
Guess NATO knows its supporters that they think they can get away with shit as dumb as this. #nato #nazi #russia 
#BREAKING #RUSSIA #KAZAKHSTAN   üî¥KAZAKHSTAN: RUSSIAN MILITARY ARRIVED TO KAZAKHSTAN!  Russian Military landed in Kazakhstan amid recent escalations in violence erupting during large-scale protests in several cities across the country.  #BreakingNews #Video  #KazakhstanProtests 
From me and others on whether #KazakhstanProtests /#CSTO complicates #Russia/#Ukraine. My take - don't think this is a resource or bandwidth prob for the Russian leadership. This isn't a wrench in Russian plans for #Ukarine. For @rwp2011 @BusinessInsider
