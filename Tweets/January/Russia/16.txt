Opinion💭by Patricia Adams &amp; @LSolomonTweets  Contrary to the spin, #Russia is playing defence, not offense, in its confrontation with the West over #Ukraine.  Misunderstanding Russia’s motivations could have tragic repercussions. 
Russia Issues Subtle Threats More Far-Reaching Than a Ukraine Invasion...  #russia #issues #subtle #threats #more #far-reaching #than #a #ukraine #invasion
"#Russia invasion of #Sweden"🙃 
I am confused - why is @McFaul advocating that #Ukraine capitulates to unacceptable demands of #Russia to limit its sovereignty? It seems to contradict his own earlier recommendations...

#Ukraine. The hunt for Poroshenko was from the beginning a nasty affair borne of private emotions; now it is subversive of the state at the most dangerous time. Cui bono? Well, obviously #Putin's #Russia. Honi soit qui may y pense. @anders_aslund 
#Russia must de-escalate its military build-up in around #Ukraine, respect its international commitments &amp; core principles of European security.  Watch #NATO Secretary General @jensstoltenberg’s interview with @RosieBarton @CBCPolitics.  @CanadaNATO 
That means, #lukashenko is also responsible. And there's no #Belarus as independent state any longer. View it as part of fascist #Russia. Sanction Russia, if you want to hurt the puppet Lukashenka regime. 
#Russia's security concerns are just a pretext for armed action. This is a particularly dangerous moment for #peace in #Europe. The big question is how to stop the Russian escalation process?  #VladimirPutin #NATO #Ukraine
No !  #Ukraine giving up #NATO &amp; #EU future membership in return for less #Russia agression is wrong: 1.UKR has chosen its future in euro-atl fora 2.RUS had a deal already and broke it: Budapest memorandum 1994. 3.Appeasement now will only lead to more broken promises by #Putin
