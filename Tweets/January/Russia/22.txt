This is a weak response that begets more aggression worldwide. If we stand down on #Ukraine to promote “de-escalation” then #China will be emboldened to take advantage of a weak willed US. De-escalation &amp; diplomacy WON’T work if #Russia has no interest in either! #UkraineCrisis

It's 150k troops on Ukraine's eastern border and 50k in Belarus along the northern front. Thats close to Kyiv. Ukraines military isn't advanced or well trained, but they're gritty and seen mucho combat since 14 and theyre fighting for their homeland. #Russia will lose many troops

If the West insistis in having military base close to #Russia, then Russian should respond in kind by installing a military base close to US border.
