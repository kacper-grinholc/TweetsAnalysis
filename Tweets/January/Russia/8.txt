@Billbrowder #Sanctions on #Russia are urgently needed. No appeasement. Russia is aggressive! No more "if"!! Attack on 🇺🇦 is happening since 2014.  On 🇬🇪 since 1993. Russian forces in 🇲🇩 since fall of USSR. Block #NS2 and all United Russia related financial assets in NATO countries.
Economic sanctions may not be sufficient to deter #Russia from another attack against #Ukraine . Putin’s favorite tool of military intimidation must be undermined by a renewed U.S. and NATO military posture in Europe and military aid for Ukraine.  
@StateDept @SecBlinken #Sanctions on #Russia are urgently needed. No appeasement!. Russia is aggressive. No more "if". Attack on 🇺🇦 is happening since 2014.  On 🇬🇪 since 1993. Russian forces in 🇲🇩 since the fall of USSR. So on... Block #NS2 and United Russia related western financial assets.
#China and #Russia are acting together principally because they are no longer afraid of #America. They see no cost in supporting each other as they engage in belligerent conduct. Their union is the ultimate sign of disrespect for #Biden.
It is possible that Kazakhstan is a false flag to allow a display of military readiness by all Soviet BLOC countries in the region. This could be a display of force and a direct message to NATO. #Kazakhstan #KazakhstanProtests #KazakhstanProtest #Russia #NATO

Harsh V Pant: For all the testiness on #IndoPacific &amp; emergence of #Quad, Moscow values a partner such as New Delhi that has demonstrated its ability to maintain its strategic space by standing up to #China &amp; challenge the US on defence ties with #Russia 
This is a bad move for the #Biden team. Do not reward #Russia for military threat to #Ukraine and extortion of #NATO. 
.@theeconomist: "Mr Putin says that his country is threatened. It is not. #NATO is a defensive alliance. Even after #Crimea, it has held back from putting permanent combat forces into eastern #Europe. The real threat is Mr Putin.”  #Russia

#Democrats pushed the #BigLie that #Russia interfered w/the 2016 #Election, but they said the #2020Election was the most safe &amp; secure election ever. If our #Elections are safe &amp; secure they don't need a new law. But they wanna federalize elections to win #Election2022 &amp; beyond. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony #Blinken on Friday accused #Russia of "gaslighting" and pushing a "false narrative" that it was under threat from #Ukraine and #NATO to justify a troop build-up near its border with the former Soviet republic.  READ MORE:

Russian Deputy Balbek: Erdogan said to former President Nazarbayev in 2018 that 'FETO is a threat to all countries in which it has a presence'; 4 years later he was right. However, no one thought that such an uprising could occur in Kazakhstan. #Kazakhstan #Russia #Tokayev
Russian Deputy Balbek: FETO has a hand in the events in Kazakhstan. Those who led the protests came out of FETO schools. The events in Kazakhstan were provoked by the DEASH structures.  #Kazakhstan #Russia #Tokayev

Let’s be honest about these discussions about #US, #Russia , #Ukraine and #EU will have over #NATO I think we can all agree Russian demands they sent out are unattainable and quite honestly laughable. Also let’s be honest we honestly don’t know what’s going to be discussed.
