#Russia: US President Biden admitted that any kind of incursion by Russian forces into Ukraine will immediately be classified as aggression. The US will react with sanctions, whether the entire Russian army crosses the borders of Ukraine or only some units ("green people").

Putin presents a profound threat to peace in Europe as 'drumbeat of war' sounds on Russia-Ukraine border    #nft #nftcommunity #putin #russia #europe #news #digitalart #pixelart #pixelnews 
As Russia ramps up their troops on the Ukrainian border, I hope the government is considering how the Trump admin and the GOP gave Russia the greenlight to go forward. #Ukraine #Russia #GOPTraitors
To face up to the challenges from #China and #Russia, the #USA needs a leader of the stature of Ronald Reagan. Since 1989, mediocrity has prevailed in most aspects of USA Foreign Policy, with China, Russia and other authoritarian regimes exploiting to the maximum this mediocrity
#Germany spends a huge amount of development aid in #Ukraine and has done a huge amount to support Ukrainian reforms. However they’re burning massive amounts of goodwill with their softly-softly approach to #Russia - the source of numerous memes and online jokes in UA.
Negative degree windchill is no problem when you're from the north. #Ukraine #Russia 
This whole blaming game the democrats &amp; republicans do towards each other is childish… both of you would rather give the military $700+ billion to deploy soldiers continuously worldwide to pick a fight with #Russia / #China / #Iran / etc,  instead of investing atleast half of &gt;
📣 @CISAgov issued an alert this week warning of ongoing Russian state-sponsored threats against #criticalinfrastructure and providing guidance on how to reduce the risk.  #Cybersecurity #APT #Russia #CISA #FBI #NSA #ICS #OT #CyberThreat
#sanctions pls explain why it was unacceptable to be in #Afganistan in response to those ignoring  #UnitedStates and #UnitedNations threats of ‘sactions’ BUT #PresidentBiden can clearly state actions at all/any cost will be taken against #Russia and #Putin? #RussiaUkraine
Wow @cnn really trying to make @POTUS seem inept. Completely taking his #Russia and #Ukraine comments out of context and building a bullshit narrative around them.
Zelensky expects talks with #Russia to lead to de-escalation in Donbas [  ] Il y a 7heures Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he hopes that talks with Russia will help de-escalate the situation on the border with #Ukr

#China, #Iran, and #Russia will hold joint naval drills tomorrow, the so-called “2022 Marine Security Belt” exercise will take place in the north of the Indian Ocean. It’s said to be their third trilateral naval drill. 
#Ukriane Not a core interest of the USA.  Talk to #Russia @POTUS @SecBlinken Improve our sorry relations with #Cuba and #Venezuela
#Nuclear #Energy Investments Are Set To Soar💰⚛️🦅 "$91 billion will be invested in global nuclear sector by end of next year as its popularity continues an upward trend in heavily populated countries such as #China, #India &amp; #Russia."🏗️⬆️🤠🐂 #Uranium 🏄‍♀️ 
5/ So where does #Russia fit?  Just like it did in 2020, Russia is expected to help the #Belarusian regime repress the anti-gov't protests in February. The drills happen to be planned close to major protest hotspots.  In exchange, it gets access to the southern border. (5/6) 
4/ This brings us to the protests. #Belarus is expecting large-scale unrest, similar to what we saw in August 2020.  Back in 2020, #Russia helped Lukashenko repress the protests, and now it's time to pay up. (4/6) 
@theragex Im not sure about it, this guy talk to much and also take things out of context #Desinformation #nato #ukraine #Russia #uk #usa 
@B52Malmet Countries like #Russia #Belarus #Hungary #China #NorthKorea &amp; now apparently #USA all make it harder to #vote , falsify the votes, or just ignore the votes &amp; declare the autocratic ruling party the winner #GQP = #CCP
