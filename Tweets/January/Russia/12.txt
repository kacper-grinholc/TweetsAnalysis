@MoscowTimes In any case, natural gas and oil are a receding, dwindling source of energy. Nuclear power, hydro, wind and solar power are the future. Putin and the Russian oligarchs shot themselves in the leg. #Russia #Putin
Now that Mr. Putin is puffing himself up and hitting his chest, someone must remind him of his country's modest economic size and that it will shrink by the use of military force against Ukraine!   #ukraine #russia #Putin

Well, 4625 kHz just got interesting again. Probably pirates and I have seen reports in recent days of this sort of activity but the screengrab describes what I am seeing. The first thing I thought of was the TX/RX ID function in MultiPSK. #Russia #Ukraine

@mfa_russia @RusEmbIndia @RusEmbUSA @RussianEmbassyC @EmbassyofRussia @RusEmbJakarta @RussianEmbassy @RussiaUN @mission_russian @RusMission_EU @RusEmbAU Please pronounce only one phrase: #Russia will blink (why had it made all this fuss than?), Or Russia will not blink ‚Äî when will it invade #Ukraine than? The rest of the ‚Äúdeliberations‚Äù is futile; it‚Äôs a mere waste of taxpayers‚Äô time. #NATO #Putin #EastWest
So it‚Äôs okay for Europe to be energy dependent on the #USA #SaudiArabia and other authoritarian regimes, but #Russia is a no no. Mmh! #NordStream2 #Hypocrites Ever more reason to transition to #GreenEnergy as much as possible
Russia: ‚Äúwithdraw alliance troops in formerly Soviet bloc countries‚Äù  Also #Russia: ‚Äú‚Ä¶otherwise we invade Ukraine‚Äù

"Extending #Russia": a 2019 report by US think tank and strategic asset RAND Corporation.  What happened the past year in #Belarus and #Kazakhstan is not chance, nor is it organic evolution. The blueprints were made in the US years ago. 
The ‚Äúcrisis Russia has created for Ukraine‚Äù? What a pile of crap. I have no patience left for this fake diplo speak. Stop helping Russia with lies.  Speak truth:  #Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. It‚Äôs been waging its bloody war of aggression against the entirety of UA ever since. 
üá∫üá≤‚ö°Ô∏èüá∫üá¶ US advises Americans not to travel to #Ukraine due to ‚Äúthreats from #Russia‚Äù.    
It's unnecessary to be subjected to #Russia's #FuelPrices manipulations.  #Europe in surround by unlimited #Hydrogen in the #oceans.  This is going to continue to happen because the #EU refuses to see and use the abundant #ZeroEmission fuel that is all around them. #HydrogenNow 
why don't we just let #Russia into #NATO though?

And #Moscow will never make any commitments to change its policy and behavior. Never has and never will. #Russia must be subdued just like #Hitler and #Nazi Germany. 
If you had any doubt we're ruled by insane people...  #Crimea was "1st time military force had been employed to change borders in Europe since Hitler‚Äôs invasions &amp; occupations."  Hypocrites like @EvelynNFarkas always forget #Kosovo.  @DefenseOne #Russia
