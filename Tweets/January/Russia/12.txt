“Putin Is Not Stupid”: This Expert Spent 182 Days On The #Russia-#Ukraine Battlefields
Here's the summation of the #NATO-#Russia dialogue over #Ukraine. It clearly failed, not because of NATO but because of Russia's unwillingness to de-escalate and withdraw 'non-starter' demands. So the ball is now firmly in #Putin's court. 
Harsh V Pant: At a time when #China’s rise has managed to upend most of the assumptions about the global order, the US-#Russia tango in Europe will have a significant bearing on the #IndoPacific balance of power.

The #US seeks diplomacy and easing tensions in one's face, and then turns its back and imposes sanctions.  #Russia
#Russian Deputy FM's statements reflect the size of tension and differences in the #Russia-#NATO Council meetings.  #US #Ukraine #Moscow
Well, 4625 kHz just got interesting again. Probably pirates and I have seen reports in recent days of this sort of activity but the screengrab describes what I am seeing. The first thing I thought of was the TX/RX ID function in MultiPSK. #Russia #Ukraine

@mfa_russia @RusEmbIndia @RusEmbUSA @RussianEmbassyC @EmbassyofRussia @RusEmbJakarta @RussianEmbassy @RussiaUN @mission_russian @RusMission_EU @RusEmbAU Please pronounce only one phrase: #Russia will blink (why had it made all this fuss than?), Or Russia will not blink — when will it invade #Ukraine than? The rest of the “deliberations” is futile; it’s a mere waste of taxpayers’ time. #NATO #Putin #EastWest
So it’s okay for Europe to be energy dependent on the #USA #SaudiArabia and other authoritarian regimes, but #Russia is a no no. Mmh! #NordStream2 #Hypocrites Ever more reason to transition to #GreenEnergy as much as possible
Russia: “withdraw alliance troops in formerly Soviet bloc countries”  Also #Russia: “…otherwise we invade Ukraine” 
What's going on with #Ukraine and #Russia? Bidens going to get our troops killed.

"Extending #Russia": a 2019 report by US think tank and strategic asset RAND Corporation.  What happened the past year in #Belarus and #Kazakhstan is not chance, nor is it organic evolution. The blueprints were made in the US years ago. 
The “crisis Russia has created for Ukraine”? What a pile of crap. I have no patience left for this fake diplo speak. Stop helping Russia with lies.  Speak truth:  #Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. It’s been waging its bloody war of aggression against the entirety of UA ever since. 
🇺🇲⚡️🇺🇦 US advises Americans not to travel to #Ukraine due to “threats from #Russia”.    
It's unnecessary to be subjected to #Russia's #FuelPrices manipulations.  #Europe in surround by unlimited #Hydrogen in the #oceans.  This is going to continue to happen because the #EU refuses to see and use the abundant #ZeroEmission fuel that is all around them. #HydrogenNow 
why don't we just let #Russia into #NATO though?

And #Moscow will never make any commitments to change its policy and behavior. Never has and never will. #Russia must be subdued just like #Hitler and #Nazi Germany. 
If you had any doubt we're ruled by insane people...  #Crimea was "1st time military force had been employed to change borders in Europe since Hitler’s invasions &amp; occupations."  Hypocrites like @EvelynNFarkas always forget #Kosovo.  @DefenseOne #Russia
