@votevets The aggression shown over the years since 2007 at very least has been all one-sided. It has not come from #Russia, it has come from the #USA &amp; #NATO.  Creating a myth about 'Russian Aggression' then fixing this mirage in one's mind as fact just encourages geopolitical blindness.

#NATO applies dual-track approach against #Russia: strong deterrence and defence, combined with dialogue. They "will not compromise on core principles. Such as the right for each nation to choose its own path". #Ukraine joining NATO is redline for Russia
Sounds like #Germany &amp; #Russia have secretly signed a "Non-aggression Pact". 
As war looms larger, what are #Russia’s military options in #Ukraine?  from @TheEconomist #military #geopolitics #foreignaffairs 
#US-#Ukraine-#Russia  In effort to de-escalate, top diplomat off on trip to Europe. 
#Russia #Ukraine  🚨🚨🚨  Very interesting view on Russia's motivation in the present crisis 
Think about the 1994 Budapest Memorandum.  Seems more recent and relevant to me.  "(...) to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine."  You signed it. #russia #russland #ukraine 
Withdrawal of support comes at a time of increased tensions with #Russia; skyrocketing gas prices; another “charm offensive” by #Turkey, with whom @SecBlinken tweets he is “coordinating” to deal with the #Ukraine crisis; and when #EU gas independence is a strategic imperative.
The #USA's move to revive a #ColdWar project against #Russia is headed for defeat, as our country becomes a #failedstate  
@leithfadel @BHL is afraid the helmet will ruin his hair. #ukraine #russia
Finland/Sweden/Ukraine : try to join #NATO #RUSSIA : NO
Ukraine-crisis, dangerous, but 1968 was much more dangerous. Here is my story of the nuclear threat then Passcode CE#A5ScX    #Ukraine #Russia #Germany #Luftwaffe
@EndGameWW3 The administration is absolutely directing their diplomatic corps to delay the #Russia|n effort in every manner possible. This gives #Ukraine more time to dig in and distribute that shipment of 2350 NLAWs.   Russia has clearly already made the decision to attack.
On #Kazakhstan, @USAmbUN @LindaT_G tells me the US will plan to address the situation when the UN Security Council holds consultations on Central Asia next week. One to watch as US-#Russia tensions simmer.
