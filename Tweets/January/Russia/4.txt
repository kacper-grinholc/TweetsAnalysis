The Civil War Isn’t Over: #Russia Is Launching Air Strikes In #Syria (by @SteveB7SFG) -  
Of course, the past year #2021 was difficult. But you need to look for advantages in everything! For example, I managed to visit 6 cities of #Russia: #Kazan, #Samara, #Chelyabinsk, #Surgut, #Moscow, #St.Petersburg. And where did you manage to visit? What new have you seen? #2022 
What if they are planning to escape, I mean planning a trip to #Russia?

5/12 #Russia’s population has only recently grown due to a bulge in women born in the 1980s and the Crimea annexation. In anticipation of a population collapse, #Putin may try to grab more of the #Ukraine or absorb #Belarus.
4/12 Covid could not have come at a worse time for #Russia. Losing 2 years of births from the 30-34 cohort is a disaster. Due to the upcoming collapse in the number of women, it is possible Russia could have annual natural population losses of nearly 1 million by the late 2020s.
(3/12) #Russia is facing demographic disaster. The largest cohort of women is 30-34 (4.3%), just before fertility falls significantly. The 25-29 cohort is just 3% &amp; 20-24 cohort is only 2.2%, lower than any other cohort up to age 75-79. A crash is births is inevitable.
🧵 (2/12) #Russia is economically and politically stagnant. Median income is flat, repression is increasing &amp; Putin’s popularity is falling. But #Putin’s adventurism is driven by worsening demography.
#Russia Is Not the Great Rival; #China Is  in the long term, we want Russia on our side in the long struggle between the U.S. and the West, and Communist China.
From severing #Russia from the world's banking system to further arming #Kyiv, #US President Joe #Biden is hoping threats of painful consequences will deter his counterpart Vladimir #Putin from invading #Ukraine
Apart from dispelling the sense of drift, #Putin’s visit was a clear signal of the commitment to a multipolar global order and reinforced strategic balance as an enduring factor in ties, writes Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty. #PutininIndia #Russia
