@GoToTurkeyUK Im afraid of Turkish  #AnimalAbusers roaming free more than COVID19. If they rape dogs why wouldn't they rape anyone ? You need to work on that ! I'd have PTSD if I went #Turkey. #ANIMALABUSE &amp; #BESTIALITY ARE SERIOUS MENTAL DISORDERS. A sign of societal breakdown  in Turkey! 
#Turkey's incarceration of journalists is notorious and smacks of #autocracy. Good to see #Tolu go free. We must keep up international pressure to free more journalists from Turkish jails.

@hansdocter   I agree. And no, this is not AS (please don't devaluate that word, and start fighting real #Antisemitism). And yes, of course it is selected indignation, but I'd like my adopted #Homeland to be selective over #China, #Russia, #Iran, #Syria, #Turkey...  @NLinIsrael

#Turkey is not safe! The FBI tracks #AnimalAbuse because it's been a precursor to other serious crimes like serial killing.  So it's not even safe for the general population  of Turkey especially  CHILDREN are at risk 🔽 Intentional cruelty &amp; bestiality are  fine with government!

#Turkey's budget turned into a record deficit in December as the government spent an unprecedented amount on gas imports, as national gas import company Boru Hatlari ile Petrol Tasima received a total of $4.4B from the government through loans in the last month of 2021 alone.
