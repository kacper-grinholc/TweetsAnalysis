There is definitely an art to #tracking and calling a wild #turkey.  Jerry Law had no trouble tracking this turkey.   That’s because the turkey’s tracks have been here for nearly a century now.   
#Turkey &amp; #UAE supplied drones are being used to massacre innocent civilians in #Tigray. IC should hold Turkey &amp; UAE responsible for such crimes against humanity. #StopDroneAttacks @SenateForeign @SecBlinken @WHNSC @EU_Commission @vonderleyen
@EndGameWW3 Yeah Now queue #Turkey and #Azerbaijan now. 
Don’t be fooled into thinking #China or #Turkey cares about African problems. They only care about their interest payments being made on time. Anti-colonization conversation in Africa should talk about Africa’s closest ally- China. #KnowMore @mustafa__bag

We cannot allow President Erdogan to order over 1400 municipalities across Turkey to round up street dogs this will lead to one largest slaughter of dogs ever seen. I will be on @talkRADIO with @TVKev at 8pm to discuss tonight @PipTomson @scanme_tukslaw @DogDeskNews #Turkey

OTD in 1913 the Battle of Lemnos began, the Turkish fleet was forced to retreat to its base within the Dardanelles and remain there for the rest of the First Balkan War  #travel #Turkey #history
The piece is also slightly unfair regarding the period up to Ergenekon in that the military guardians tried one more time in 2007 to manipulate the system against an Islamist party and paid a price for it. Doubt many want that system back.  #Turkey    
Looking forward to tuning in to hear @domdyer70 @TVKev discuss the current situation developing in #Turkey and the indiscriminate killings of street dogs across the country. #DontVisitTurkey

Am I being naive?  Why I am thinking it might be to sabotage our developing  r/Lship with #Turkey  the fact the successor of #Feltman is connected with Turkey. 🤔
I want #China, #Rusia, #US, and Arabs middle east such as #Turkey, #UAE, #SoudiArabia, and others out of #Africa - specially out of #Ethiopia.  They are destabilizing the continent and destroying #Ethiopia, #Tigray. They are extending #TigrayGenocide!

The whole negotiation between #Armenia and #Turkey is waste of time and effort, as long as Turkey the source of all evil does not recognize the Armenian Genocide and makes reparations to Armenian Nation. These are meetings with no results as Turkey remains the same evil location. 
#armenianbreakingnews The first so-called meeting of the special representatives of #Armenia and #Turkey will take place on January 14 in #Moscow A reminder that controversial Ruben Rubinyan was appointed Special Representative from Armenia. 
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's salary has been raised by 14.4 percent to a total of 100,750 Turkish Liras, as part of a previously accepted budget proposal. #Turkey

Making political predictions in an unprecedented historical environment is best done after five or six bourbons, and in the company of close friends.  #Turkey
On #KazakhstanProtests:  #Turkey: Hopes tensions ease, expresses confidence that #Tokayev will overcome.  #Russia: Says no nationals hurt, calls for dialogue over "street riots and violation of laws", praises #Tokayev's actions on energy prices cuts, dissolving govt.
@sumlenny Spillover coming to #Turkey next? The people want sound money and an end to endemic corruption and autocratic dictate.

@PhaedraXTeddy As you say Phaedra @PhaedraXTeddy  VERY disappointing  The President should clarify if Street Dogs were not meant to be rounded up &amp; killed and issues of Dog Fighting &amp; alleged Corruption MUST also be addressed Tourists know, their disgust &amp; upset will stop them visiting #Turkey
HH Sheikh @TamimBinHamad held telephonic conversation #Turkey's President on robust strategic ties as well as regional &amp; international developments of sharing interest. #Doha #Qatar #MarsalQatar 
Army officers and other security officials travel to #Turkey for training. Maintain friendly relations with #Turkish colleagues. They are proud of the victories of #Turkish arms. They are proud of their common past.
@ArmSpoxMFA The criminal #regime of #turkey helped the #dictator of #Baku in his plans to wipe out #Armenians from #Karabakh , this was not 100 years ago this was just a year ago. Trusting the #enemy is foolish and no relationship can be meaningful without trust.  
#Africans betray #Tigray out of #ignorance, #China and #Turkey betray #Tigray to look after their #Artillery #market, and #Western countries betray #Tigray out of retaliation of the past ideology.

Saw news 🇹🇷 municipalities inc. #Istanbul &amp; #Izmir were close to bankruptcy - but false news❌  Fitch rates these munis above #Turkey's rating, but warns that unhedged debt could put pressure to sustainability.  Just a fair view and a reminder how damaging Lira volatility can be. 
New record in #Turkey  It seems likely the country got spooked by people questioning the ultra quick levelling off of cases in the #Omicron wave.  66,487 new #Covid19 cases announced today, 30k above last Weds. This looks more realistic. 143 more deaths reported.
