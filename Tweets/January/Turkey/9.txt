Don’t be fooled into thinking #China or #Turkey cares about African problems. They only care about their interest payments being made on time. Anti-colonization conversation in Africa should talk about Africa’s closest ally- China. #KnowMore @mustafa__bag

The Ethiopian dictator #AbiyAhmed is enlisting the help of the #UAE #Turkey, #China, #Iran, &amp; #Russia to continue killing civilians in Tigray &amp; #Oromia. Why are the US &amp; EU watching idly by? #UNSC &amp; @NATO have failed my people again. #StopDroneAttacks
As the #Lira falls in #Turkey some may look to their own government to see if they are next. I bet their citizens whiskey they had #Gold #Silver &amp; some #Crypto right now.
“In recent days, Abiy has traveled to #Turkey, ostensibly to promote diplomacy. In reality, it appears the meeting was to arrange delivery of drones to Abiy’s forces to use against the #Tigrayans.” @EUAmbUS @NATO #TurkeyDroneSale @JosepBorrellF @UN 
Please sign this urgent petition to #Turkey to Stop Arms Sale to #Ethiopia. #TurkeyDroneSale #ErdoğanGenocideAccomplice
Despite the agreement signed with #Russia last month and the extension of a security pact with the #US plus the key relationship with #China, #Kazakhstan is getting closer to #Turkey, out of all countries.
#Turkey's slide to #authoritarianism... 
The genocidal war against #Tigray has already seen 2.2M+ IDPs, a man-made famine, 80% of health facilities looted, vandalized or destroyed. #Turkey &amp; #Ethiopia has signed a military agreement escalating the war even more. @EUAmbUS @EUatUN @SecBlinken @StateDept #TurkeyDroneSale

#Turkey currently has a pending application to join the EU, we are urging the @EU_Commission to look into how Turkey is capitalizing on the genocide occurring in #Tigray. @JosepBorrellF @BorisJohnson @EmmanuelMacron @Haavisto #TurkeyDroneSale #ErdoğanGenocideAccomplice
#Turkey &amp; #UAE supplied drones are being used to massacre innocent civilian in #Tigray. IC should hold #Turkey and #UAE responsible for such crimes against humanity. #StopDroneAttacks  @SenateForeign @SecBlinken @WHNSC @EU_Commission @vonderleyen  
#OPINION: A more appropriate policy for #Turkey would be to maintain its position in #NATO and become an additional conduit between its fellow alliance members and #Russia, writes @yakis_yasar 
Turkish bombing on Tel Abyad countryside, north of #Raqqa caused material damage to the residents’ property and large wave of displacement of those residents. #Syria #AANES #Turkey #SDF 
#ICYMI - According to the Daily Sabah, “#Turkey had raised its profile as a generous nation through its #humanitarian efforts over the past two decades.” @Aliceinalbania reports. 
@AnnLinde @AnnLinde the most effective way to bring peace to Ethiopia is to stop #NATO's #Turkey from adding fuel to the fire. #AbiyAhmed is a heartless and brainless murderer. Removing the drones from his firepower only way to insecure him to peace. #Sweden can help. #NoFlyZoneInTigray
