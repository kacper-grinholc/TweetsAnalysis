Comment: 01162022 In case of any confrontation btwn Russia and #NATO the position of #Turkey could make the difference. Turkey's position should be clearly determined in advance. The worst risk is Turkey siding w Russia, the lesser staying neutral, the best supporting @NATO.
@lindyli @kilonova_gold Lindy, remember when two #Russians called @LindseyGrahamSC &amp; pretended to be #Turkey's minister of defense? I'll bet Lindsey wasn't even on a secure line. Why would a U.S. Senator think he's authorized to speak on behalf of a #POTUS?
