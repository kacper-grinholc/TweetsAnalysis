The Ethiopian dictator #AbiyAhmed is enlisting the help of the #UAE #Turkey, #China, #Iran, &amp; #Russia to continue killing civilians in Tigray &amp; #Oromia. Why are the US &amp; EU watching idly by? #UNSC &amp; @NATO have failed my people again. #StopDroneAttacks
Don’t be fooled into thinking #China or #Turkey cares about African problems. They only care about their interest payments being made on time. Anti-colonization conversation in Africa should talk about Africa’s closest ally- China. #KnowMore @mustafa__bag

Turkish drones have already been making their way to Africa in recent years. #ElSalvador is now looking to buy up military equipment from #Turkey.   Could military cooperation become the next phase of Turkey’s blossoming relationship with Latin America?

The #Yezidi #Yazidi civilians - genocide survivors - seek return to areas of origin in #Sinjar #Shingal . Many obstacles prevent their return. One main source of fear are regular airstrikes from @nato member #Turkey . @coalition must not allow this. No fly zone for #Sinjar!  End. 
The place where the sun sets most beautifully is Izmir, the city of beautiful people.. Izmir is a great love.. 🌴 #Izmir 💙 #Turkey 🇹🇷 #Memories 📸 @ İzmir, Turkey 
After being nailed at #FATF; #Turkey and #Pakistan have turned to 'Lawfare - Propaganda through litigation' In a crappy report, Turkish-backed #UK-based law firm 'Stoke White' has accused @adgpi Chief &amp; HM @AmitShah of War crime in #Kashmir. Lets probe &amp; debunk the #propaganda 
This map looks like a bird 🤩  #Turkey is the head 😇 #Iraq is the heart 🖤 #Saudi_Arabia is the body 🏋️‍♂️ #Oman is the tail 🙄 #Syria and #Palestine are the neck 🙂 Finally, #Iran and #Egypt are the wings 👐 #islam #FreePalestine 
Today two incidents happened in #Turkey, both in a mosque. A middle age lady shouted “We are many retired people here and we are starving.” Erdogan threatened our pop-icon #SezenAksu bcs of her lyrics on Adam and Eve. Let’s see whether the reality or the distraction will prevail.
Turkey is a major menu item. And we want to help you serve up the best in the business! #BigM #Foodservice #Turkey #HealthyFood #MenuIdeas 
#Turkey: #İstanbul court adjourns 38th hearing of the case against @YaseminCongar_ &amp; four others affiliated with shuttered #Taraf newspaper till March 4. #CFWIJ condemns legal harassment of journalists, whose trial has lasted over six years.  Read:  
The Persian Gulf region is witnessing a vertical rapprochement as #Iran's &amp; #Turkey’s reset with Gulf Arab states help “depressurize” the MidEast. The region still faces horizontal geopolitical tensions in the Levant, between Iran and #Israel as well as between Turkey and Syria.
Paul Dales, our Chief UK Economist, discusses how central banks will be focusing on #inflation at the expense of growth, our new interactive tracker of core euro-zone inflation and what’s gone wrong with economic policy-making in #Turkey  
For more information on this  attack by #Turkey , the latest in a long line of attacks against the #Yezidi #Yazidi in #Sinjar, see below:

#Turkey passes law to exempt converted lira deposits from corporate tax 
At some point international powers will have to recognize the detrimental and far-reaching impact of #Turkey actions in #Syria and #Iraq , the blatant human rights and international law violations, and hold decision-makers to account. Sinjar requires a no-fly zone immediately!!! 
Yes-Abiy already sold premium real estates to #UAE. #Turkey &amp; #China also expect mega projects 4 supplying deadly #droneattacks &amp; armament. Other factors possible &amp; likely to cripple Ethiopia-Shame to those against z West. Sadly West’s interference is limited to feeding z hungry.

#Turkey’s media authority RTÜK has reportedly called music channels and “warned” them about possible “grave sanctions” if they play the song of Sezen Aksu, over which she faces threats and a criminal complaint 
Furthermore, there is evidence that #ISIS #Daesh is staging a large operation in #Syria . Meanwhile, #Turkey is conducting drone strikes in both #Syria and #Iraq . One might assume that any @NATO member conducting strikes in this theater would target #ISIS . But not #Turkey .
A taxi driver in Istanbul #Turkey 🇹🇷 brutally assaulted a #French 🇫🇷 woman for refusing to blackmail her about the fare.
