@wbmosler #Turkey's inflation 36% after the collapse of the #TRY I think it is time we gave proposals a rest?  
#Turkey annual inflation is at 19yr high. Pres #Erdogan controls monetary policy and it seems that he does not care that his citizens are becoming poorer every day. Many economists estimate that without significant change inflation in Turkey will reach 50% in the coming year. 
Kudos to @bbcturkce for reporting that although #Turkey's official inflation for 2021 is 36%, the spike in food prices is dramatic: flour (86%), chicken (%86), vegetable oil (76%), milk-yogurt (72-74%), chickpea (66%), lentil (61%) pasta (60%), beef (56%), bread (54%), egg (47%).
