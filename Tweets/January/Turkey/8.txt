#Turkey &amp; #UAE supplied drones are being used to massacre innocent civilians in #Tigray. IC should hold Turkey &amp; UAE responsible for such crimes against humanity. #StopDroneAttacks @SenateForeign @SecBlinken @WHNSC @EU_Commission @vonderleyen 
Let's summarize #Kazakhstan as follows: #NATO tried a pan-turanist coup by using turkish fascists, to destabilize the region and destroy all efforts of #China and #Russia, who want to unite the region. #Turkey's role was training and logistics, while #Nazarbayev commanded #GLADIO
This is a result of terrorism.  The terrorists are the Turkish Defense Ministry.  @SecBlinken, we cannot continue to ignore Turkey’s wanton disregard of international law.  @USNATO, when do we wake up and realize that #Turkey is not the kind of ally we want or need?
