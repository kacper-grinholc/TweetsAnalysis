President #Erdogan of #Turkey realised that his hands were tied in a non-executive presidency prior to the 2016 failed coup. He used his popularity to win a referendum that enabled him to abolish the post of prime minister and bring #presidentialsystem 
The explanations and claims in Morgentau's book are inconsistent and fabricated;He proved this by comparing the official reports and telegrams that the amb. sent to the MFA during his duty in Istanbul with the information in his diary during his stay in #Turkey.  #Armenian
