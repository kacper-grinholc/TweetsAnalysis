Is Turkey Still a NATO Ally? Bullying NATO members and¬†accusing¬†the West, namely the US, of supporting terrorism, it is becoming hard to believe that Erdogan‚Äôs Turkey remains a NATO ally.  #Armenia, #Bulgaria, #Cyprus, #Greece, #Turkey #NATO #UnitedStates   
#TRT is a biased towards showing India in bad shape. Why can't it focus on issues plaguing #Turkey? Ottoman man disintegrated in 1922 and #Turkey still thinks itself a reckoning force in world politics. You are a small nation. Go and solve your problems.
