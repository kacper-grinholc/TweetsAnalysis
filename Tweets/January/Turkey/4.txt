Is Turkey Still a NATO Ally? Bullying NATO members and accusing the West, namely the US, of supporting terrorism, it is becoming hard to believe that Erdogan’s Turkey remains a NATO ally.  #Armenia, #Bulgaria, #Cyprus, #Greece, #Turkey #NATO #UnitedStates   
#TRT is a biased towards showing India in bad shape. Why can't it focus on issues plaguing #Turkey? Ottoman man disintegrated in 1922 and #Turkey still thinks itself a reckoning force in world politics. You are a small nation. Go and solve your problems.

#Russia is making a joke of its  September 2018 pact with #Turkey to establish &amp; maintain a demilitarized zone in northwest Syria’s Idlib province to protect civilians.  Now, Russia is  deliberately bombing those civilians. War crimes? 
Throughout the pandemic #Turkey has a history of reporting unbelievable low numbers then suddenly hiking the numbers to figures more believable.  Same again this week. After levelling off, suddenly successive big rises. 54,724 new #Covid19 cases today and 137 deaths.
