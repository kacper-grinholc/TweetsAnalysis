#Biden has called almost every European NATO member to supposedly discuss #Ukraine except for #Turkey: This shows that US is not serious about protecting Ukraine but more concerned abt optics: looking as though it is.   Turkey is home to NATO’s 2nd largest military.
#Turkey’s response to any aggression by #Russia in #Ukraine will not be coordinated with White House or #NATO.  Ankara is aware of US/NATO stance against Turkey &amp; will not allow itself to be used as a mere part-time alliance member; only when Western interests are at stake (1)

“In 2005, Kocharyan stated that #Armenia has no territorial claims against #Turkey, also referred to by Serzh Sargsyan. #Armenia has never questioned the #Armenian-#Turkish border, you will not find any leader of Armenia that would question the #Armenian-#Turkish border.

The president of the Radio and Television Supreme Council says they warned medias not to play music that is not "protecting the national moral values". This is a return to the 80's, the return of state #censorship. #Turkey 
#Turkey: Update: #turkishairlines cancels all flights from #Istanbul Airport until 25 January because of weather conditions
“A substantial amount of the responsibility for the atrocities committed against #Tigray during the war lies with non-Ethiopian actors collaborating with #Ethiopia, including […] #China, #Eritrea, #Iran, #Somalia, #Turkey, and the #UAE.”   Read more 👇🏾 
#erdogan #Turkey today   How long does the average Turk put up with this? Plus losing Iranian gas???  A long cold winter.   "Bread queue under heavy snowfall in Sultangazi"

2/2 As for the establishment of diplomatic ties between #Armenia and #Turkey , @NikolPashinyan noted that he cannot say whether they will be established this year or not, but he considers it logical that the parties achieve this result.
1/2Do we want to open #Armenia - #Turkey border? Yes. In 2009 it didn't work out, now we have to try to take into account previous experience. In 2009, there were no preconditions in🇦🇲🇹🇷protocols,but later some appeared.We can’t guarantee that it will not happen. @NikolPashinyan
#TURKEY: Some citizens stranded near the Bolu Mountain Tunnel on the Istanbul-Ankara road have set up tents to prevent freezing. The video was released 36 hours ago and the roads were opened.

Twenty Turkish bar associations have released a joint statement calling for the release of former People’s Democratic Party (HDP) deputy co-chair Aysel Tuğluk, who suffers from early-onset dementia. #Turkey 
The disdain between #Iran &amp; #Turkey for each other within many levers of power and populace is often not well understood. Erdogan’s poetic recital last year challenging Tehran’s legitimacy in Azerbaijan drew much greater ire from Iranians than other perceived slights. Daniel 8 ? 
The leading terrorist sponsor, bloodthirsty warmongering dictator has now gone into war with poor #dogs too.  Is there ever time that #turkey isn’t committing massacres?!! #BoycottTurkey #stoperdogan 
#Armenia sincerely wishes to normalize relations with #Turkey - Pashinyan

Do we want to open #Armenia-#Turkey border? Yes, and we are sincere in that position: @NikolPashinyan 
Shame on you #Turkey may tourists boycott your country, horrific &amp; horrendous what you've to 1000's of dogs, evil scum you are 😡 
Let it snow let it … | #Snow blankets Athens, Greek islands and #Turkey's Istanbul  #FYI #Greece  
Corrupt #US politicians prefer sponsoring terrorists, like Bin Laden, PKK/YPD, #Russia's allies like Armenia, Serbia &amp; spineless #NATO members, like Germany, France &amp; Greece, instead of strengthening an important ally #Turkey, which faces #Putin's army in Libya, Syria, etc. 
How could #Turkey ever dream of challenging #Iran, when it is so dependent on Iranian gas?  Turkey may have great ambitions, but it is way too dependent on Iran, Russia etc. to afford a major crisis with them
