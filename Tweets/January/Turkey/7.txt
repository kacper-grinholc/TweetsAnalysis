The Turkish government has changed the conditions for foreigners to acquire Turkish citizenship. #Turkey 
Don’t be fooled into thinking #China or #Turkey cares about African problems. They only care about their interest payments being made on time. Anti-colonization conversation in Africa should talk about Africa’s closest ally- China. #KnowMore @mustafa__bag
@rickygervais does anyone know of #dog #rescues  in #Turkey. We want to help.

"#Turkey is backtracking on a plan to use bonds —instead of cash— to pay for banks’ possible losses from a new government tool to bolster the lira... The rapid turnaround suggests the ruling party may have faced strong pushback from lenders." via @markets
Four pistols, ammunition for them, edged weapons and an armored vehicle were confiscated from them. It is curious that Arman Dikiy recently returned to #Kazakhstan from #Turkey

A Turkish court ruled on Friday to release two students from jail in the first hearing of a broader case over campus protests against the government’s appointment of a rector at Istanbul’s Bogazici University.  #news #TayyipErdogan #Turkey 
Former HDP MP Abdullah Zeydan has been released after more than five years in jail. #Turkey  
I am reminded of all the spinning machines in various think tanks that were laboriously peddling #Turkey's presence and proxies in #Libya as something positive.   Of course, one needed only common sense to deduce how any entity supported by a corrupt, radical regime can't be good

#Pakistan didn't cancel T-129 ATAK deal with #Turkey.  ▪️The Pakistani army has denied news that it has cancelled the deal for T-129 ATAK helicopters with Turkey, adding that the speculations are baseless. 
@EAaltola Boycotting anything #Turkey @visitTurkey_ @turkeytourism
In #Kazakhstan, the most recent rapprochement is the one with #Turkey ,not Russia ?! So the idea that an armed group is formed to liberate KZ from Russian influence just does not seem right. For so long, we argued Turkey's Cold War politics against #Russia actually hurt Turkey,

Horrible unnecessary dog slaughter going on in #Turkey - truly shocking scenes, this is outrageous @Channel4News please highlight this 😟 
A brutal Turkish cull of street dogs, just another reason I’ll never set foot in that shithole of a country ever again #Turkey 
What the hell is going on in #Turkey with their stray dogs? This is NOT the way to sort it... 😟

In the ancient city of Kastabala (Castabala), which dates back to 500 BC, located in Turkey’s southern province of Osmaniye, archeologists have unearthed relief masks depicting comedy and tragedy plays.  #Archaeology #Turkey
In 13 days, #Turkey is set to fail to meet @coe’s call for the release of #OsmanKavala and @hdpdemirtas. This is a complete disregard of the rule of law to which Turkey is bound to as a member of the Council of Europe #freeosmankavala #FreeDemirtas
When will the international community hold #Turkey &amp; #UAE responsible for the mass killings around the world by supplying drones? @POTUS @SecBlinken @LindaT_G @jakejsullivan @HouseForeign @SenateForeign @StateDept #StopDroneAttacks
It's now "#Turkiye":   #Turkey #turkeynews
In a pathetic attempt to replenish its foreign exchange reserves &amp; support the Turkish lira, #Turkey will require exporters to convert a quarter of their FX earnings to liras. This is nothing more than a tax on exporters &amp; a form of FX controls. 
Look at this. Shame on #Turkey boycott now. This is apalling. #DogsofTwittter @TurkEmbLondon ppl should not visit with such abuse going on. 
Districts in #Wallaggaa &amp; #Shawaa have been targeted by #DroneAttacks by #Turkey &amp; #UAE drones &amp; operators. So far, their targets are schools, factories and civilians. #Oromia shall settle every lose a thousand fold.  #WeShallTriumph #WaaqBlessOLA #FuckOromoDiaspora

@Jonahssea @Adrian_Hilton @domdyer70 #barınaktaoelueyoruz  In #Turkey, stray animals are being captured to be put in #dyinginhere camps.   In the shelters, There is NO food, water and healthcare for them. Please do not let municipalities take them!  Be their voice!
It’s clear that @RTErdogan fears a situation like #Kazakhstan 🇰🇿 happening in #Turkey 🇹🇷. @JosepBorrellF should consider a 🇪🇺🇹🇷 ‘contingency plan’ to avoid pushing Erdogan further towards 🇷🇺🇨🇳 and provide 🇪🇺🇺🇳 brokerage if violent electoral protest erupt in next 18+ months.  ⬇️👇  
Are there #art projects available to #refugees in #Turkey? Thanks @dryasinduman
#Balkans keep bleeding as the young and educated people migrate not because of the financial situation but because Balkans is a boomers paradise. Nobody wants to talk about that though, because boomers think if you have a high salary you cannot complain. #Bulgaria #Greece #Turkey 
Walking around the @metmuseum last week, I stumbled on this John Singer Sargent of the Hagia Sofia. Diving into Google, it seems he has a few paintings from #Turkey - anyone know anything more about his visit there?  
No amount of intimidation &amp; attacks from President Erdogan’s army of trolls will stop me from talking out about this barbarity. We must all stand up for Turkey’s street dogs #Turkey
